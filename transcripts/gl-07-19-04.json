        "tammy: I bet it's pretty bad.",
        "Joey: No, it's pretty good.",
        "Tammy: I heard it was really bad.",
        "Joey: No, it wasn't.",
        "Tammy: Everyone said so.",
        "Joey: Who's everyone?",
        "Tammy: It's long. It goes on and on forever.",
        "Lizzie: Joey.",
        "Joey: Whoa! Lizzie, whoa, whoa, whoa. What happened?",
        "Lizzie: These guys were outside and they were drinking. They started talking dirty to me and they tried to force me in their car, but i tried to fight them off.",
        "Danny: Tammy, can you keep an eye on things for a little while? I'm going to go look for michelle. What happened to you?",
        "Tammy: Lizzie says some guys outside tried to hurt her.",
        "Danny: Here? Right outside my house? Well, did they hurt you?",
        "Lizzie: No. (Crying)",
        "danny: It's okay. Hey, it's okay. It's all right. Tell me who did this to you. I'll take care of it.",
        "Tammy: Yeah, lizzie. Tell us. (Phone rings)",
        "tony: Yeah?",
        "Michelle: Tony, it's me.",
        "Tony: Me, who?",
        "Michelle: It's michelle. I'm right outside the club. And so are the cops. They're going to raid the place. So get out of there now.",
        "Gus: Hey, beth.",
        "Beth: Oh... (Laughs)",
        "gus: Sorry.",
        "Beth: No. It's fine. I just wasn't expecting anyone.",
        "Gus: That's all right. Are you alone tonight?",
        "Beth: Yes, I'm waiting for lizzie to come home from the summer dance.",
        "Gus: Right. Well, I just stopped by to get some magazines. Apparently alex left something for me. Table tops or table...",
        "Beth: Yes, yes, yes.",
        "Gus: ...Settings.",
        "Beth: They are right over here.",
        "Gus: Oh, thanks. She even dog-eared a few pages for you.",
        "Gus: Is that right?",
        "Beth: Subtle, huh?",
        "Gus: That's all right with me. It makes... Makes it easy. That's not bad, I guess.",
        "Beth: You were expecting something, what, a little more over the top maybe?",
        "Gus: With the spaulding family you never know, you know. You know the one thing that surprises me about this family?",
        "Beth: Oh, no. Let me guess. The way they serve a full three- course breakfast every morning on their best china? No. Maybe it's the way the maids iron everything, including your underwear?",
        "Both: Hmm.",
        "Gus: No, it's the way that they actually seem normal sometimes.",
        "Beth: Yes, well, they can seem normal. As long as those nasty little skeletons stay safely tucked away in their closets.",
        "Gus: Hmm.",
        "Buzz: Al? Sorry I couldn't get here sooner. I had to show lucille how to cash out.",
        "Alexandra: Okay, okay. It's all right. I'm just glad you're here now.",
        "Gus: Well, what's up? You didn't sound so good on the phone.",
        "Alexandra: Would you believe that i just wanted to... Had to see your face?",
        "Gus: Well, I might. But I think that's not the whole story.",
        "Alexandra: I think it's just one of those long nights of the soul, you know, when all your misdeeds come back to haunt you. Ever have one of those?",
        "Buzz: Me? Did I ever? Please. I wrote the book on it. Whatever it is, this too will pass.",
        "Alexandra: I'm not so sure.",
        "Harley: Frank has nothing to hide, ross.",
        "Ross: Well, then, i need some help, frank. Because internal affairs finds this file in your possession. It contains proof that darci matthews had ties to brad green and vinnie salerno, two prime suspects in a drug case that you are handling. Why did this information about your fianc\u00e9e never find its way to evidence?",
        "Frank: I already told you: I have never seen that file before in my life.",
        "Ross: Well, then how did it get it in your briefcase?",
        "Harley: Easy. Someone's trying to frame him.",
        "danny: Lizzie, I need you to tell me. Who did this to you?",
        "Lizzie: I didn't see them. Two guys.",
        "Tammy: I mean, you said, you struggled with them and they tried to push you into the car. You must have seen something.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, but, danny, you can't do anything, okay? They were talking to me, and i ran my mouth right back, okay? I made them angry.",
        "Danny: So what, lizzie? That does not give them the right to hurt you. Can you just let it drop, please? Joey. Please just take me home, joey.",
        "Danny: No, no, no. Not yet. Not till you point these guys out to me. Lizzie, I can't let this slide, especially when it happens on my property. Understand? Come on. Come on outside with me. Come on. There's nothing to be afraid of. Come on. It's okay.",
        "Joey: I should probably take her home; I brought her here.",
        "Tammy: Look, joey...",
        "Joey: Tammy...",
        "Tammy: Sorry. You go first.",
        "Joey: No, no. You, please.",
        "Tammy: Okay. I'm disappointed you have to go, because it was so nice to talk. I was hoping we could talk some more.",
        "Joey: Tam, did you mean what you said before about coming here with remy, because...",
        "Tammy: I wanted to see you. I miss you so much sometimes it hurts.",
        "Joey: I miss you, too.",
        "Lizzie: Come on, danny, hurry up. You're not going to find anything.",
        "Danny: Nobody. They probably took off.",
        "Lizzie: Can i go back inside? Yeah, they said so, because they said something about going to the park or something like that.",
        "Danny: The park?",
        "Lizzie: So?",
        "Danny: Yeah, okay. Joey's going to give you a ride home? You're sure you're okay?",
        "Lizzie: I'm positive. Thank you.",
        "Danny: All right, go in.",
        "Lizzie: Hey, ready to go?",
        "Tammy: So did danny find those guys who tried to hurt you?",
        "Lizzie: I think he's out looking for them right now actually.",
        "Tammy: He's got a long night ahead of him.",
        "Lizzie: Excuse me?",
        "Tammy: I said it's been a long night. But a good one.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, for some people who weren't attacked tonight. You ready to go?",
        "Joey: Yeah. Why don't you head out to the car? I'll be right there.",
        "Lizzie: I'm not going out to the car by myself in the dark when this just happened.",
        "Joey: I've got to go.",
        "Tammy: I understand.",
        "Joey: I'll call you.",
        "Tammy: Okay.",
        "Sandy: That was interesting. You okay?",
        "Tammy: Great. I think.",
        "Alexandra: You know when i came back from europe, it was for business, yes. But really it was to connect... Reconnect with my family.",
        "Buzz: You missed them.",
        "Alexandra: Yeah. Ironic, isn't it? But ever since i've been back, all I've done is hurt them.",
        "Buzz: Oh, come on. That's a bit of an exaggeration, come on. Don't you think? Come on.",
        "Alexandra: No, no. First thing out of the box, what do i do? I cause problems for alan at spaulding, try to unseat him...",
        "Buzz: I can't fault you for going after him.",
        "Alexandra: Pulled out all the stops to keep gus from finding out that alan was his father.",
        "Buzz: That was a bit low.",
        "Alexandra: Yeah. Couldn't really do anything to help phillip in his hour of need. Didn't really do anything to help lizzie. You know, when i was in europe, all I could think about was being back in the bosom of my family. I would get here, everything would be wonderful just like old times.",
        "Buzz: And big surprise, it didn't. When i got back to town, i messed everything up. I still haven't sorted it out yet.",
        "Alexandra: No, but you're farther ahead than i am.",
        "Buzz: I've had longer.",
        "Alexandra: And then you came into my life.",
        "Buzz: Ah!",
        "Alexandra: Ah! And you were fun and you were light and you threw me on the back of your motorcycle.",
        "Buzz: You needed it, baby.",
        "Alexandra: Yeah. Oh, buzz, I want you to be happy. I want you to have everything. I want everything to be right for you, your family, your children.",
        "Buzz: That's what i love about you. Unlike the rest of the spauldings, you wouldn't let anybody hurt me or my family.",
        "Alexandra: God, i'm such a failure.",
        "Buzz: Oh, come on.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, I am. I am.",
        "Buzz: You're not a failure. It's just that you don't always let well enough alone. That's all.",
        "Alexandra: Or else I find a bad situation and I can even make it worse.",
        "Buzz: Well, there is that.",
        "Alexandra: (Scoffs)",
        "buzz: Oh, come on. What is all this self- recrimination? You're doing great. Spaulding's out from its legal problem, the stocks are up, you're on good terms with phillip and alan. My god, gus and my daughter want you to plan the wedding. What's...?",
        "Alexandra: (Laughs) fine. You're right. You're right. Everything is wonderful. The going's so good and if i had any brains at all, i would get out while the going's good, huh?",
        "Buzz: Get out? What are you talking about? Yeah, man, she did it on the first date. I don't know. I've never... Whoa, whoa, whoa....",
        "Buzz: Hey, watch it. Aren't you guys a little old to making out in a park? I mean... (Laughter)",
        "alexandra: Well...",
        "Buzz: What is it? Are you okay?",
        "Alexandra: Oh, I'm fine. I'm fine.",
        "Ross: Okay, harley, who is it that would be trying to set up frank?",
        "Harley: Well, someone who's not too bright obviously. Or doesn't think you are. Come on, a file stuffed full of incriminating evidence suddenly appears in frank's briefcase the day that i.A. Arrives? And does frank try to stop i.A. From looking in the briefcase? No, he says, \"go ahead. Help yourself.\"",
        "I.A. Agent: Maybe he forgot the file was in there.",
        "Harley: Is that how frank became chief of police, by being careless? Is that why you appointed him to head your commission on organized crime? Come on, ross, how long have you known him? How long have you guys been friends? You know and i know you know that frank would never try to conceal evidence in any case no matter who it hurt. And if by some far stretch of the imagination he did just that, he'd never be stupid enough to leave it lying around where the whole world could see it.",
        "Ross: Harley, harley, i understand what you're saying. And trust me, no one wants to believe in frank's innocence more than I do.",
        "Harley: Come on, ross. Do something about this.",
        "Ross: Because when I was running for mayor, i made a promise that i would not shy away from the tough questions. And at the moment I can't think of a tougher question than this: Prior to today, did you have any knowledge whatsoever that darci matthews had a relationship with brad green and vinnie salerno?",
        "Harley: No. No, he did not.",
        "Frank: Yes, i did. I've known for a while that darci knew vinnie salerno. But I didn't find out until recently that she knew brad green. Ross, as god is my witness, i have never seen that file. You don't believe me, do you?",
        "Ross: Frank, I have to do my job.",
        "Frank: Which is?",
        "Ross: Dealing with the facts and investigating this fully so you can clear your name.",
        "I.A. Agent: If he can clear his name.",
        "Harley: Would you shut up, bishop? Just shut up. Everybody's knows I.A. Has had it in for my brother for years.",
        "I.A. Agent: Guy falls for a hot young chick. He could break the law to keep her.",
        "Frank: I have never broken the law. And if you say that one more time i swear to you, i'll break something on you. On my signal, all right. Freeze, santos!",
        "Tony: Well, officers, we're scheduled for another raid already, huh?",
        "Cop: Just keep your hands on the table.",
        "Tony: Hey, look, I was just going over the books. You want to take a look? Go ahead. Nothing there.",
        "Cop: We'll be back, santos. Again and again.",
        "Tony: Counting on it.",
        "Cop: You can count on it. Come on, fellas.",
        "Tony: Good day, gentlemen.",
        "Michelle: Whoa, that was close, huh? Those guys were really itching to get you. I'm glad i called you when i did.",
        "Tony: Why did you, michelle? Hmm?",
        "Michelle: What?",
        "Tony: Why did you give me the heads up?",
        "Michelle: To help you. Why else? So you wouldn't get caught.",
        "Tony: Next time, stay out of my business, all right?",
        "Michelle: Excuse me? You ungrateful jerk.",
        "Tony: Hey.",
        "Michelle: I just saved your sorry little butt.",
        "Tony: Hey, first of all, I've got nothing to hide, michelle. Second of all, i don't want you around here! The less you know, the better. You understand that?",
        "Michelle: Yeah, spoken just like your cousin danny. (Laughter) that's what she looked like, man.",
        "Danny: Hey. Get up. On your feet. Let's go. Now. Get up. I don't know, man. Getting down here was really easy, but getting back up is going to be a problem. (Laughter)",
        "danny: You think that's funny? Is that funny? Is that funny to you? Man, what...",
        "Danny: What else is funny to you, man? Dude.",
        "Danny: What else is funny? Roughing up young girls? Is that funny to you? What are you doing?",
        "Danny: Tell me. What? What do you think I'm doing? I'm teaching your friend here that actions have consequences.",
        "Michelle: I don't need to be protected, tony, okay? Not by you, not by danny, and not by anyone. You keeping things from me doesn't help!",
        "Tony: What are you doing here, michelle? What are you doing here? First, you barge in on the fact that i had a date with whatever her name was.",
        "Michelle: Oh, is that what you call that, a date?",
        "Tony: And then you show up here! You know, you were having a good time at danny's place. What was that, an act? What are you doing here?",
        "Michelle: No, i was having a good time!",
        "Tony: You were, huh? So why did you leave?",
        "Michelle: Because danny wasn't interested in me. He's waiting for his wife to come back-- you know, adorable, beloved, saint michelle, the woman I'm not, the woman i probably never will be.",
        "Tony: So?",
        "Michelle: So he didn't want me there. And you don't want me here either. So even though i saved your sorry little butt, i'm going.",
        "Tony: Good idea.",
        "Michelle: You know, this thing with the cops, does it happen a lot?",
        "Tony: Do me a favor, michelle. Just go. Go.",
        "Michelle: Okay, i will take that as a yes. You ever tried going straight, tony?",
        "Tony: Yeah, i did.",
        "Michelle: And?",
        "Tony: Didn't work. That's danny's gig, michelle. Not mine. Let him go. He didn't do anything.",
        "Danny: No? Is that right? What about you? Did you do anything? No.",
        "Danny: You know, I'm talking about a party? A girl? A blonde girl? I don't know.",
        "Danny: You know what I'm talking about? What party, man? What girl? We didn't do anything, all right?",
        "Danny: You don'T... No. No party.",
        "Danny: All right, get out of here. Get out. Stay out of trouble.",
        "Ross: Frank, take it easy. Take it easy.",
        "Frank: I have never let my personal loyalties ever interfere with my job. Nor will i ever.",
        "I.A. Agent: Because you won't have your job much longer. (Arguing)",
        "ross: Frank!",
        "Frank: Let go of me! I need some air.",
        "Harley: Frank, wait! Frank!",
        "Gus: Honey, honey, honey.",
        "Harley: Just give him a minute.",
        "Gus: What's going on? What's going on?",
        "Harley: Okay, what happened? What happened is ross got some anonymous call saying that the department should look into how the delirium case was handled, that somebody on the case was dirty.",
        "Gus: That's crazy.",
        "Harley: Yeah. So, you know, ross starts an investigation, i.A. Shows up. They're doing their thing. The next thing you know, they find a file in frank's briefcase on darci.",
        "Gus: Darci?",
        "Harley: Yes, darci. And it had photos, it had all these details about her past involvement with vinnie salerno and brad green. Now they think that frank stole that file to try to protect her from suspicion.",
        "Gus: We don't even have a file on darci. We never had a file on darci.",
        "Harley: No kidding. No kidding. It's obviously a plant. Somebody made it up to try and make frank look corrupt. Who? Who would do that? Coming up on \"guiding light\":",
        "Michelle: I've got a question for you, and i want you to be straight with me. Can you do that?",
        "Danny: Depends. Will you stick around long enough to hear it?",
        "Lizzie: Pretty dimples... Don't change anything, okay? No matter what anybody tells you, you're perfect.",
        "Sandy: So you were saying you had some epiphany about lizzie?",
        "Tammy: I don't buy for a second that she was attacked by anybody. You know, I bet she made up that whole stupid story just so that joey would feel sorry for her and take her home.",
        "Sandy: Yeah?",
        "Tammy: Although, to joey's credit, I'm pretty sure he didn't fall for it. In fact, he seemed kind of annoyed, which is totally fine by me. And while she was out here with danny, joey and I had a real moment of connection.",
        "Sandy: Yeah?",
        "Tammy: He even said that he missed me-- although that was after I said it first-- but he meant it. I'm sure he meant it. Although i wonder if he would have volunteered it if i hadn't... Well, whatever. Whatever. The point is, I know that joey doesn't like lizzie. I know that he still cares about me. But if i said that i wished that joey had ditched lizzie for me tonight, you wouldn't think i was a horrible person, would you?",
        "Sandy: Nah! In fact, if I was a real friend, I would probably tell you to go after joey right now, before lizzie gets her claws in him, but I won'T.",
        "Tammy: Why not?",
        "Sandy: I'd rather you stayed here.",
        "Lizzie: It's weird that my mom didn't wait up for me. I guess she kind of just got tired and gave up and went to bed. (Laughs) I don't really want her seeing me like this, anyway.",
        "Joey: Maybe she should, you know? She'd probably take you to the hospital, get you checked out.",
        "Lizzie: Joey, i'm really sorry.",
        "Joey: About what?",
        "Lizzie: About ruining our date.",
        "Joey: It wasn't your fault. And it wasn't a date. We're just, you know, hanging out as friends.",
        "Lizzie: We still had fun, though, right? I mean, we danced, and you're an awesome dancer. I had fun.",
        "Joey: Nah.",
        "Lizzie: No, you really are. How about we dance now? That's a good idea.",
        "Joey: What? No. Lizzie...",
        "Lizzie: Oh, come on! It's just one last dance, okay?",
        "Joey: I don't think that... Lizzie, come on.",
        "Lizzie: Okay. How's that?",
        "Joey: Look, i think i should get going.",
        "Lizzie: No, no, no. Joey, come on, please. Just once, all right? That's it. It's no big deal, okay? I just want to end this night on a good note. You know, everything really scared me tonight, and i was just glad that you were there for me.",
        "Joey: But i wasn't really there for you.",
        "Lizzie: No, i know, but if you were, I know you would have stuck up for me. And then i came inside and i saw you, and everything was better. Seeing you always makes everything better. I mean, we always have fun, no matter what we're doing, right?",
        "Joey: Yeah, pretty much.",
        "Lizzie: Your hair is getting so long. It looks so good.",
        "Joey: I need to cut it.",
        "Lizzie: No, no, no, no. I love it. And your pretty dimples... Don't change anything, okay? No matter what anybody tells you, you're perfect.",
        "Joey: Lizzie, um, that's not what i want.",
        "Lizzie: I'm sorry. I guess I just misunderstood.",
        "Joey: Not to say that you're not a great girl, and really pretty and everything. It's just...",
        "Lizzie: You're still stuck on tammy, right? Even though she did go to the dance tonight with another guy.",
        "Joey: Look, tammy and remy are just friends, liz.",
        "Lizzie: Really? Is that what she told you?",
        "Joey: Yeah, she told me that because it's the truth.",
        "Lizzie: I wish I didn't have to do this, but now you give me no other choice.",
        "Joey: What are you doing? Do what?",
        "Lizzie: Break your heart.",
        "Buzz: You're going to sit down, have a glass of wine, and you're going to tell me what's got you so freaked out.",
        "Alexandra: Is it really necessary?",
        "Buzz: Sit, sit, sit.",
        "Alexandra: I mean, I've humiliated myself enough for one evening, haven't i?",
        "Buzz: Sit. Sit. What's going on?",
        "Alexandra: Nothing, really. I think I'm just feeling sorry for myself.",
        "Buzz: Because? Does it have to do with frank?",
        "Alexandra: Frank?",
        "Buzz: Frank. He had you in for questioning. You were upset. You've got to understand about... Frank has more integrity in his little finger than i do in my entire body. He didn't suspect you of anything. Well, maybe he did a little. But he's being thorough, you know? He does everything totally by the book. He has to have every \"I\" dotted, every \"t\" crossed before he closes a case.",
        "Alexandra: You really love him, don't you? You think the world of him.",
        "Buzz: Oh, god. Yes. Yeah. I was M.I.A. For most of his childhood, and deenie, she left when he was still young, so his values-- his honesty, his decency-- came from inside himself. He is the best man, the best father, the best person I know. And he's my son. My son is my hero. It doesn't get any better than that.",
        "Frank: So did she fill you in?",
        "Gus: Oh, frank, listen to me, this is ridiculous. It's retarded. You're going to beat this thing, okay? It's going to be all right, i promise you.",
        "Harley: Wait a minute. Where are you going?",
        "Gus: I'll be right back. This has got to be alex. Who else is it going to be? (Cell phone ringing)",
        "alexandra: I'm sorry, i better check this.",
        "Buzz: Well?",
        "Alexandra: Ah, it can wait.",
        "Buzz: You sure?",
        "Alexandra: Positive.",
        "Gus: Alex, when you get this, you've got to call me. We need to talk.",
        "Ross: So just finish that up.",
        "Frank: You're suspending me? I thought you were on my side.",
        "Ross: I am, frank. It's not an official suspension.",
        "Frank: Well, at least not yet, right, ross?",
        "Ross: Listen, all i'm asking you to do, frank, is take a few days off while we sort through things, okay?",
        "Frank: I can't believe this. You think I did it.",
        "Ross: No, i don't.",
        "Frank: Look me in the eye and say that.",
        "Ross: Frank, I don't think you're corrupt. But if you were protecting darci, i would understand that. If there was private information in that file about blake, i would be tempted.",
        "Frank: Tempted? How could I possibly be tempted? I told you, I never saw that file! How many times have I told you that, ross?",
        "Harley: Okay, okay. Frank.",
        "Ross: Frank, I hate this as much as you do.",
        "Gus: Ross is making... He's making a huge mistake, here.",
        "Harley: Yes, he is.",
        "Gus: Frank, this isn't just bad for you. It's bad for the whole department. It's not about this little hint of a scandal. I mean, this is, like, a lack of leadership, you know? You're the glue, man. You keep this train on the tracks.",
        "Frank: I appreciate your support.",
        "Harley: Of course he supports you. You're not just his boss, you're his best man, and you'll be his brother-in-law. We're going to be family. So we're going to stick together and we're going to get through this together. Right?",
        "Gus: Absolutely.",
        "Tammy: You want me to stay here with you? Why?",
        "Sandy: I enjoy your company. You're the only person in here with a working brain in her head.",
        "Tammy: And I'm all depressed about joey. Are you sure you want to stay and watch me pine for him all night?",
        "Sandy: Well, I don't know, because you're pretty cute when you pine.",
        "Tammy: You know, maybe joey had the right idea. Maybe he was better off leaving without me.",
        "Sandy: Tammy, joey was better off with you than he'll ever be without you. You're amazing. There are a lot of guys who would kill to be with you.",
        "Tammy: Kill?",
        "Sandy: Well, okay, maim.",
        "Tammy: You are pretty weird sometimes, you know that, right?",
        "Sandy: Yeah. And you shouldn't sell yourself short.",
        "Tammy: Okay, I will try not to. Thank you so much for listening to me vent about joey tonight. You're an awesome friend, sandy. Thank you.",
        "Michelle: Hey, guys.",
        "Sandy: Hey.",
        "Michelle: The party over?",
        "Sandy: Oh, yeah. Hey, danny was looking for you. Where did you go?",
        "Michelle: I was just out and about. Is danny not here?",
        "Tammy: Not unless he came in the back way.",
        "Michelle: Oh. All right, thanks. Thanks. You guys heading home?",
        "Tammy: After we help you clean up.",
        "Michelle: No, no, no. No need. I got it.",
        "Tammy: But...",
        "Michelle: Hey. You're here.",
        "Danny: So are you.",
        "Michelle: Where were you?",
        "Danny: I'll tell if you will.",
        "Michelle: I'm sorry i took off without saying anything.",
        "Danny: Well, hey, at least you're dry this time.",
        "Michelle: Wasn't it a great night, though? Hmm?",
        "Danny: It obviously was for you.",
        "Michelle: Oh, come on. I think you were having a pretty good time before i left, weren't you?",
        "Danny: Yeah, so imagine my surprise when you disappeared.",
        "Michelle: (Groans) you can be a pretty cool customer sometimes, huh? Look, I want you to tell me something. I've got a question for you, and i want you to be straight with me. Can you do that?",
        "Danny: Depends. Will you stick around long enough to hear it?",
        "Michelle: Okay. What was your life like when you were in the mob? And don't leave anything out.",
        "Sandy: So you ready to make like a banana and split?",
        "Tammy: Hey. Thanks again for listening to me go on and on about joey tonight. I appreciate it.",
        "Sandy: Any time. I hope things work out the way you want them to, tammy.",
        "Tammy: You know, the more i think about it, the more i think they will.",
        "Sandy: So you're not even worried about lizzie anymore?",
        "Tammy: Joey's a smart guy. If he doesn't see through lizzie now, he will soon enough.",
        "Lizzie: You know, i really wish it didn't have to come to this. I was hoping that either tammy would come to her senses or you'd find out the truth...",
        "Joey: Lizzie, lizzie, i don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, come on. You have to. Tammy? Hello?",
        "Joey: Hello, tammy, what? What, lizzie?",
        "Lizzie: I don't want to do this, joey.",
        "Joey: What? Do what?",
        "Lizzie: Tammy doesn't care about you anymore. What? Would I tell you this knowing it would hurt you if I wasn't telling the truth?",
        "Joey: Lizzie, i don't know who you're getting your information from, but it's not right.",
        "Lizzie: I'm getting it from tammy, okay? The source. Listen, you're going to have to see this for yourself. Do you remember the other day when we were at the beach and i was filming everybody with my camera phone? Well, I accidentally got this on my phone.",
        "Tammy: Joey can be such a doofus sometimes, and he doesn't even know it. I mean, eating pasta with the guy, you practically need a raincoat! I mean, he slurps it up and gets sauce all over the place, and then he takes his bread and your bread and he wipes the plate up with it, and then he sucks it all down like a vacuum cleaner. You should see all the products he has. He's got, like, ten different colognes and they all smell like tree bark.",
        "Harley: Frank, you don't have to do this. You're only going to be gone a couple of days.",
        "Ross: Gus? I need to talk to you for a minute.",
        "Gus: What?",
        "Ross: In private.",
        "Gus: Right here is fine with me, mr. Mayor.",
        "Ross: All right. I know this is awkward, with frank stepping down.",
        "Frank: Excuse me.",
        "Harley: On temporary leave.",
        "Ross: With frank on temporary leave, yes, I need someone to run the department. I want you to be interim chief.",
        "Sandy: Giddy up, buttercup. I found them.",
        "Tammy: I used to wish on stars all the time when I was little.",
        "Sandy: I still do. You... Any of your dreams come true?",
        "Tammy: Not a single one. But hey, that's okay. Now that i'm older, I know you can't pin all your hopes on a star. If you want something, you've got to make it happen.",
        "Sandy: And we're back to joey.",
        "Tammy: Okay, you're right, you're right. I'll stop. But believe me, I will get joey back. I will not give up on him. I care way too much about him. And his hair? You run your fingers through it and you start looking for excuses to go and wash your hands. Joey thinks he's so cool, but deep down you know he's just a scared little boy. Not the highest I.Q. In the world, either. And he knows how to hurt you. He's got a real talent for it.",
        "Lizzie: Um...",
        "Joey: Whoa, whoa. Turn it back on. I want to hear the rest of it.",
        "Lizzie: Believe me, you don't want to see the rest. It only gets worse from there. Wait, joey. Aren't you glad you know the truth now? I mean, isn't it better?",
        "Joey: I've got to go. I've got to...",
        "Beth: Lizzie? I thought I heard the front door. Good lord. What happened to you?",
        "Lizzie: Oh, mom. I just had the best night!",
        "Michelle: Did sandy find his keys?",
        "Danny: Yeah. No, thanks.",
        "Michelle: Look, if you don't want to tell me, i guess i exaggerated when i said \"everything.\" It's not like I want this blow- by-blow account of every horrible illegal thing you ever did.",
        "Danny: Then what do you want?",
        "Michelle: I just want to know what your life was like, you know, before you went straight. What you were like.",
        "Danny: What brought this on?",
        "Michelle: Oh, i don't know. I heard some people talking at the party and, you know, they were making jokes about cement shoes and stuff like that.",
        "Danny: Well, I never wore them. Too heavy. Michelle, I don't know what you want me to say. Yeah, I was born into that life, and that life was all I knew for a lot of years. I wasn't a very nice person back then. I hurt people. I'm not proud of it, but i can't do anything to change that.",
        "Michelle: Well, are you glad you're out?",
        "Danny: Yeah. I thank god every day.",
        "Michelle: And what about tony?",
        "Danny: What? What about tony?",
        "Michelle: Does he live that way? You know, the way you used to?",
        "Danny: I wish i could say no. Tony tried to get out. And either he didn't have it in him or he didn't want to.",
        "Michelle: Which do you think it is?",
        "Danny: I think tony just feels like he needs the excitement.",
        "Michelle: Excitement.",
        "Gus: Ross, I am not going to steal frank's job away from him, all right?",
        "Ross: Oh, gus, you wouldn't be stealing his job.",
        "Gus: Good luck finding anybody in this building that's going to turn against that guy. It's just not going to happen.",
        "Ross: Nobody is turning against anybody. It's procedure. I need somebody to run the department in frank's absence.",
        "Gus: Yeah, well, like i said, find somebody else, because I...",
        "Frank: Gus, ross is right. This department needs to keep going. Someone needs to be in charge, and you're the right man for the job.",
        "Gus: Oh, frank, i'm... I don't know.",
        "Frank: I would consider it a personal favor. Besides, i don't want this place to be a mess when I get back. Because i will be back.",
        "Gus: All right, frank, if you want me to... I'll do it if you want. Only because you're asking me to.",
        "Frank: Thank you.",
        "Ross: Yes. Thank you, gus. I'll see you first thing in the morning.",
        "Frank: I've got to go get some more stuff out of my office.",
        "Gus: All right.",
        "Harley: Man, oh, man. This is a nightmare.",
        "Gus: I know, honey. I know.",
        "Harley: No, no, no, no. You did the right thing. Look, you stepping in for frank, that's one less thing he has to worry about. And I'll tell you, i'm making this my primary focus until we find out who did this to him. This is the most important thing... The wedding?",
        "Gus: Honey, don't worry, okay? We're going to move forward. We're going to just put one foot in front of the other and we'll take care of everything, okay?",
        "Harley: Yeah, you're right. You're right, you're right. Because the most important decisions have already been taken care of, thanks to alex.",
        "Gus: Yes. Yeah. Thank god for alex.",
        "Harley: Whoever thought we'd be in her debt, huh?",
        "Gus: Right.",
        "Frank: I'm out of here.",
        "Harley: No. We are out of here. We're in this together, remember? You coming? You coming?",
        "Gus: I just... Uh, yeah. You go home. I'll meet you at home. I've just got to take care of something. Okay?",
        "Harley: Okay.",
        "Gus: You'd better answer the phone this time, alex. (Cell phone ringing) guess who, alex. Look, I know what you did, okay, so you'd better call me. You'd better call me or you're going to be sorry. You've gone too far! Some secrets are just not worth keeping. Next, on \"guiding light\":",
        "Cassie: Oh, my gosh, R.J., You're right. There she is.",
        "Jeffrey: If you don't stop impersonating cassie winslow, your relative freedom will be short-lived.",
        "Dinah: Now, did you tell me that while you were here, because really, I can only remember you kissing me."
