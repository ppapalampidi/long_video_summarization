    "Recap": [
        "Clearly things are not all that great with Thomas as he makes a snarky remark to Steffy about him being passed over for CEO. He wonders if his name was even mentioned when it was handed out. Steffy says she earned the position as her grandfather gave it to her. And if it had not been her, then it would be Quinn. The Foresters came before them and they will after them. Katie stops by to return something to Eric and he tells her the old district where Sally used to work is being razed. The last he heard of Sally she was lolling around, sipping rum out of her coconut attended to by hot and cold cabana boys. Quinn speaks with Ridge and says she hopes she did not overstep but she went to Eric last night and wants to offer the company more experience by naming him a Co- CEO. He wonders why she would do that. She says she minds him a lot less these days. Eric's health is improving but she is afraid of him coming back to work so she would like another seasoned hand at the wheel. She wants them all to get along. She used to think he was the most conceited man in the world. Now maybe that is only the second or third. She mentions Wyatt. She does not want him to remember her as the mother who was overbearing so she is willing to be better too.",
        "Nicole brings in a tray of Quinn's jewelry and Ridge wants to properly place one around her neck to take a better look. He says the stones are misfits but they complement each other nicely. Quinn confides in Ridge that the doctor gave Eric permission to fly now and he is making a one night flight to Genoa City. Their hands touch and linger when he hands back her jewelry tray. He goes to see Eric and asks what this trip is about. He says Lauren Fenmore wants him to come. When he comes back he'd like to take some time to sit down and talk. He feels like he may have been a little harsh on Ridge. He does not like them being estranged, distant and disappointed. He'd like to re-assess his position in the company. He can thank Quinn for that. Ridge says more than anyone else in this world he loves and respects Eric so have a safe trip. He then stares at the portrait of Quinn above the fireplace."

        "Thomas: I take it Liam's happy you're back.",
        "Steffy: We both are.",
        "Thomas: Good.",
        "Steffy: Hey, when I was packing, I couldn't find my blue enamel saucepan. You can only get it in Paris. What? Well, it's rent. I'm assuming you pay dad rent. I was there for the last month, so I just thought maybe you...",
        "Thomas: Yeah, yeah. I guess while I was in new York visiting my son, uh, in a house full of women that no longer wanted me there. You have to know this is three times too much.",
        "Steffy: I-I -- how am I supposed to know that? I don't know. I'm sorry.",
        "Thomas: I don't know. Maybe by asking. That's a good start. Or maybe you just want to show off your C.E.O. Buying power or remind me that when promotions were handed out, I was passed over.",
        "Ridge: Well, I'm glad to hear that. All right, yeah. Give -- give hope my best. I love you, too. Okay. Bye. Uh, I would love to tell you that Brooke said hello, but that would be a lie.",
        "Quinn: How are the wedding plans going?",
        "Ridge: Planning's overrated. But Brooke will be home soon. Did you need me?",
        "Quinn: I've done something that I hope you won't be angry about.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Eric: Katie, good.",
        "Katie: Is this what you were looking for?",
        "Eric: Yes, it is. Thank you for bringing it. I don't know where mine is. They just throw it in the bushes someplace and I can't find it.",
        "Katie: Well, what are neighbors for?",
        "Eric: Well, yeah. Hang on. I'll give it back to you. I just needed to look something up and you can take it home.",
        "Katie: Ah, you, uh, going someplace?",
        "Eric: A quick trip to Genoa city, yeah. Ohh, it's true.",
        "Katie: What?",
        "Eric: Just the march of time, I guess. Sally spectra's old warehouse downtown is scheduled for demolition.",
        "Steffy: Thomas, what is this sudden issue you have with me?",
        "Thomas: I have an issue with being passed over. Did my name even come up when -- when promotions were being passed out?",
        "Steffy: You weren't here.",
        "Thomas: I'm sorry. I was off creating a family with the broken one that dad gave me. Maybe I should have just married Wyatt, and then Quinn would have fought for me to get a desk and a name with a plaque on it on the door.",
        "Steffy: Granddad offered me the position. So whether you like to believe it or not, I've earned it.",
        "Eric: Life was so interesting when sally could pop out from behind a curtain any moment. [Chuckles]",
        "Sally: Yeah, donna, what is it? What? What is it, huh? Hello, Eric.",
        "[Cheers and applause]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Eric: So what do you think, sally? Is it fabulous?",
        "Sally: It's beautiful, Eric. The entire collection is absolutely outstanding.",
        "Eric: Well, this is so wonderful. I cannot tell you how happy I am that you're here to share this with me. There you are. Cheers.",
        "[Glasses clink]",
        "Eric: It was really fun being sally's friend. It was really fun being sally's enemy.",
        "Katie: Whatever happened to sally? Is she still, um, with us?",
        "Eric: Sally will live forever.",
        "Katie: Hmm.",
        "Eric: The last we heard of her, she was sipping a drink out of a coconut, sunning herself on some tropical island, being tended to by hot and cold running cabana boys.",
        "Katie: [Laughs] I wonder what she would have thought of Quinn. Do you think they would have been friends or enemies?",
        "Eric: I think sally's biggest talent was recognizing talent. Quinn -- Quinn has that talent, too. Just last night she suggested to me, despite their differences, that I consider promoting ridge back to the top executive level of our company.",
        "Katie: Huh.",
        "Quinn: I assume you know Wyatt and Steffy received their final divorce papers.",
        "Ridge: Ah, yes. The dreaded fl-190.",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles] I bet you have a wall in your study just papered with them.",
        "Ridge: Well...",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles] Actually, I'm really upset about this 'cause I-I really liked them together. Which was part of my zeal to keep them together, which is why I went to your father to urge him to offer Steffy the C.E.O. Position.",
        "Ridge: And there it is. You finally admit it.",
        "Quinn: I don't think I ever really kept it a secret. Not that she isn't immensely capable and doing a very fine job. But I may have inadvertently... short-changed a more... experienced leadership. Which is why I-I went to your father last night, and I asked him if he might consider having you share C.E.O. Responsibilities with Steffy. Did I overstep?",
        "Steffy: Would you rather have Quinn's name on the door? Because she would be C.E.O. Right now if I turned the position down.",
        "Thomas: No, she wouldn't. Granddad would have offered it to dad, rick, or even Thorne.",
        "Steffy: You don't think I asked those questions before I said yes? Thorne has a life outside of this building, and rick is running international. He also has a baby. Rick would just whine about it if dad got the job.",
        "Thomas: And why didn't dad get the job? I mean, he is our signature designer. And despite your gazillion followers, he's still got a higher profile than any of us.",
        "Steffy: That may be true. But it's for granddad to name a successor, and he feels betrayed by dad. They say time heals all wounds, but I don't know about this one.",
        "[Birds chirping]",
        "Katie: So Quinn suggested replacing Steffy with ridge?",
        "Eric: No, not replacing. Actually, uh, having them share the C.E.O. Duties.",
        "Katie: How would that work?",
        "Eric: Well, I guess however they want it to, really, unless Steffy balks at the idea altogether. It hasn't been figured out yet. It's just -- it's not even a plan yet.",
        "Katie: Well, I, uh, I would have thought that Quinn would be more likely to suggest that ridge gets buried alive.",
        "Eric: [Chuckles] And you thought -- see, you thought I was crazy, suggesting they go to that symposium together in san Francisco. But I think they've come to the realization they can actually work together.",
        "Ridge: Share the C.E.O. duties with my daughter?",
        "Quinn: Why not?",
        "Ridge: You talked to my dad about that?",
        "Quinn: Mm-hmm. He gave me that... \"I'm thinking about it\" face.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, once you get that face, you should just stop talking altogether.",
        "Quinn: Exactly.",
        "Ridge: But why would you do that? Why would you pitch the black sheep of the family? You don't even like me.",
        "Quinn: I mind you a lot less these days. But fundamentally, I love my husband. And even though his health is improving, I'm -- I'm afraid for him to come back to the daily grind at Forrester. And Steffy's a powerhouse, but she's young, and I think our buyers and our long-time clientele might feel a little more reassured having A... seasoned hand at the wheel.",
        "Ridge: Hmm. Me and Steffy running the place. Yeah, you know what? Then you and dad, you could travel the world and know that this place is in good hands.",
        "Quinn: Yeah. Yeah. Well, this is my family, too. And I want good things for all of us. I want us all to get along. And I used to think that you were the most conceited man in the world. But now I know that you're just second or third most.",
        "Ridge: That is so sweet coming from the wicked witch of the west herself.",
        "Quinn: Ha.",
        "Ridge: You got a nice smile. But I'm surprised that this is how you handle Steffy and Wyatt ending their marriage.",
        "Quinn: Oh, I know, right? I should be burning down the hall of records.",
        "Ridge: Something.",
        "Quinn: [Laughs] It was something you said to me about the kind of mother I want to be. And then you compared me to your mother. I don't want Wyatt remembering me as a mother who was overbearing. So... I guess I have you to thank for that, too.",
        "Thomas: So when you say that dad betrayed granddad, does that mean that he just wouldn't suck up to Quinn or he wasn't buying the whole \"brand-new me\" look?",
        "Steffy: Why don't you tell that to granddad and see where it gets you?",
        "Thomas: Wow.",
        "Steffy: What?",
        "Thomas: You're just quite the politician, aren't you?",
        "Steffy: She's a fact of life now. Granddad's more committed to Quinn than ever. Seeing that, if that makes me look like a traitor, then so be it, but I'm thinking about the family, the Forresters who have come before us and the Forresters who will come after us. You know, I'm not just keeping this company on even keel. I am showing so much more growth in comparison to our competitors.",
        "Thomas: So that makes all of this okay?",
        "Steffy: Make up your mind, Thomas. You want to say that I took the job because I'm an opportunist or that the job should have gone to you instead?",
        "Katie: Oh, just, uh, throw it in the recycling. I read it this morning.",
        "Eric: All right. Thanks for bringing it. Any excuse to get you to visit.",
        "Katie: That's sweet. I suppose you have some strategizing to do. I mean, would giving ridge authority over Quinn cause a crisis? Would Steffy really want to share the office?",
        "Eric: Long flights are good for thinking.",
        "Katie: I know he hurt you. But he's still your son.",
        "Eric: My family's been very slow to forgive Quinn for her past misdeeds. Do I really want to do the same thing to them?",
        "Katie: Safe travels, my friend.",
        "Eric: Thanks. Bye.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Nicole: Hey, where do you want these?",
        "Quinn: Uh, what is it?",
        "Nicole: Ivy finished a prototype of a necklace you wanted to see, and she told me to guard it with my life.",
        "Quinn: Oh. [Chuckles] I'll take it. Thank you, Nicole.",
        "Nicole: Mm-hmm.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Ridge: Can I have a look?",
        "Quinn: Of course.",
        "Ridge: A proper look. Excuse me. Let's see. Huh. It's, um...",
        "Quinn: It's good.",
        "Ridge: No, it's perfect. Look at this. Perfectly balanced.",
        "Quinn: Yeah. Well, the -- the -- this large stone and the small stones, they -- they shouldn't go together.",
        "Ridge: But you knew they would.",
        "Quinn: Well, yeah. I mean, it's the -- the mismatch, the antagonism.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, two misfits. But they fit perfectly, don't they?",
        "Quinn: Yeah.",
        "Ridge: Here.",
        "Quinn: Oh, uh, careful.",
        "Ridge: Oh, stop it. I got it. I know how to treat a lady.",
        "Quinn: Excuse me?",
        "Ridge: I know how to treat a lady. Why?",
        "Quinn: [Scoffs] I'm just... I'm just trying to think if I've ever been called that before.",
        "Ridge: Been called a lady before?",
        "Quinn: Well, I've been called less pleasant synonyms for a female.",
        "Ridge: Hmm. By me.",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles] By you. So, um, your father is going to Genoa city tonight. Just an overnight, weather permitting. Doctor finally cleared him to fly. I know he's thinking about you. And he's examining his heart, and he's mourning the loss of -- of his closeness with you. I think you should go to him. I think there are things that could be said tonight that couldn't be said before. But, of course, you will do what you think is best.",
        "Ridge: Thank you for going to bat for me with my dad.",
        "Quinn: Okay.",
        "Ridge: Oh. Sorry. You forgot something.",
        "Quinn: Oh. Of course. Thank you.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Thomas: Here's the thing I don't understand. And maybe you'll make fun of me for saying it, but I'll go ahead and say it anyways. I'm dad's firstborn son. Why was I not the first choice? I mean, granddad seemed to give dad the -- the option, and, uh, why not me?",
        "Steffy: First off, dad's not his father. They're two very different people.",
        "Thomas: And then there's the fact that Quinn wanted her son to be the heir apparent, if -- if only by marriage.",
        "Steffy: Okay, Quinn definitely played a part in getting me the C.E.O. position. But I have kept it on my own. We are finally in a drama-free workplace. I mean, we got Christmas bonuses. No one's had a problem with my leadership except you.",
        "Thomas: Don't let me interrupt you from patting yourself on the back so vigorously, but you've only been running the company for, what, a month?",
        "Steffy: Oh, so you're saying you could have done just as well? Well, you're wrong. You want to know why? Because you're not here. And that's a recurrent theme with you. You're in, you're out. You lack consistency. Hey, designers can be temperamental. C.E.O.s can't.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] This large stone and the small stones, they -- they shouldn't go together.",
        "Ridge: But you knew they would.",
        "Quinn: Well, yeah. I mean, it's the -- the mismatch, the antagonism.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, two misfits. But they fit perfectly, don't they? Genoa city is cold this time of year.",
        "Eric: Don't I know it. Hi, ridge.",
        "Ridge: Hey. Quinn told me you were going. What's up?",
        "Eric: Lauren Fenmore called. Uh, I'm not sure what she wants. Cross-marketing was mentioned.",
        "Ridge: And you're okay to fly, so...",
        "Eric: Yes, my doctor okayed me to fly.",
        "Ridge: And Lauren's always been a pull for you.",
        "Eric: Yeah. Listen, when -- when I get back, let's take some time to sit down together. What do you say?",
        "Ridge: I would love that. We haven't done that in a while.",
        "Eric: No, I know. I know we haven't.",
        "Ridge: Haven't really had a chance to talk about anything in a while.",
        "Eric: I may have been a little too harsh on you.",
        "Ridge: I gave you a good reason.",
        "Eric: Yes, you did.",
        "Ridge: This may have seemed like a power grab to you, but it wasn't. I was trying to protect the family. I was trying to protect you.",
        "Eric: I don't like this. I don't like this, you and me being estranged this way. I don't want to be disapproving and distant.",
        "Ridge: Dad, you've never been that, until I decided to save you from yourself. I get a little obnoxious sometimes. Maybe we can blame that on mom's side of the family.",
        "Eric: Nah, I can't blame her for everything. Listen, when I get back, let's reassess your position at the company.",
        "Ridge: Okay.",
        "Eric: It might be time for us to find a more appropriate position for you on the leadership team.",
        "Ridge: That's a conversation I would like to have.",
        "Eric: You can thank Quinn for that.",
        "Ridge: Hey, Dad. There's something you should know. With everything else, you -- you are the one person in the world that I respect and love more than anybody else. Have a safe trip.",
        "Eric: I'll see you when I get back.",
