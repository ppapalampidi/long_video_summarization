        "Bill smugly tells Steffy that it is a done deal. Brooke will soon come through that door and they will be off to their wedding. She is only with Ridge now saying her final goodbye. Mr. Drama finally has his last curtain call. He gloats that he has been patient and even realistic and given Brooke time to resolve things with Ridge and allow RJ to come around with his feelings. Once Brooke does that no one will ever come between them again. Steffy says he is lucky, Dollar Bill 2.0 and it's better than the last version. Bill says he knows Brooke did not have to forgive him for leaving her at the altar and Ridge has pulled everything in the book to get her back but she knows what Bill offers will last a lifetime. So that is why she is saying goodbye to Ridge and will become Mrs. Bill Spencer. Brooke is surprised that Ridge did this for her \u0096 the heart in the sand. He says RJ helped too. He knows how important this is \u0096 the next chapter in their lives if that is what she wants. She admits it was a wonderful gesture. He says it is more than that, they will always be connected like that heart. They will always end up together. He says she can fix all of it. Just go back to Bill and give him that Gawd-awful ring and come back to him. Now they can be a family. Maya manages to find a room so that she can talk in private with Nicole. Nicole says she cannot keep doing this any more. And the worst part is now Sasha is now defending Zende and saying what a great guy he is. In fact both Zende and Sasha have apologized over and over but it does not change what happened. Maya says she understands and it is not the first time this has happened, there is a pattern. Nicole says she cannot be with a man like that where she cannot make her own decisions.",
        "Sasha tries to ask Zende a question but he clearly does not have his mind on work. She tells him she knows he is still upset with Nicole but if she is not going to forgive him and take him back maybe it is time for him to move on. She will not keep letting him beat up on himself. Nicole has put him through the ringer time and time again and acts like he is just supposed to take it. She says he needs a woman that will put his needs first. She won't badmouth Nicole but he deserves a woman who appreciates him and understands that people aren't all perfect. And you can enjoy each other when life is unpredictable and you do not know what is going to happen next. He says that sounds good but it is not that simple; he cannot just move on. Steffy tells Bill goodbye and she wishes him well but she is afraid he is in for a fall. She recalls the many times she heard the same from her mother. Bill should not underestimate the powers of Ridge Forrester. He's on the phone making more plans and tells that someone to stock his yacht like there is no tomorrow. Brooke walks in. Bill finishes up his call with they are the only two people on this earth. He tells Brooke that the jet is ready, and the Stella Maris is ready to sale and the captain is brushing up on his skills and will have them married the minute they reach the ship. He makes sure that she saw Ridge. She nods yes. He says he is sure he was upset but he will have his dad and Quinn to worry about and that will keep him busy and in control mode and she won't have to deal with it. And they do not have to deal with everyone else's feelings but just focus on themselves and what a future they are going to have as they can make it anything they want it to be. And that starts right now. Zende admits he only made the situation worse by turning to Sasha. She says she understands that he made a decision based on wrong information but that does not make him an awful person. Or Nicole the right to make him feel like one. She makes a move toward him and he pulls back and says he can't. She says okay but he knows where to find her and she will be there for him. RJ questions Ridge of what happened. He says Brooke stood there thinking about their history and what they meant to each other but she did not give him an answer. He is hoping she went back to see Bill. Brooke tells Bill that she really loves him and she needs him to know how important he is and how he helped her not to hide from the truth but with his passion and understanding he helped build her up and be a better version of herself. He laughs when she says he inspires her with his strength and stubbornness. He tells her that he loves her and wants her to be happy as his wife. Then he senses she is pulling away and asks if RJ got into her head. Surely she is not postponing the wedding again. Whatever Forrester said she needs to forget it \u0096 fate, destiny, they are just words. He really does not want her back. He just does not want her with Bill. And that is what this is about. They are going to get on that jet and get to the ship and say their vows. He needs to hear her say that still wants to be his wife."

        "Brooke: [Sighs] Ridge. What have you done?",
        "Ridge: You're not leaving me. I'm not gonna let that happen again.",
        "Brooke: [Chuckles]",
        "Bill: It's a done deal, Steffy. As soon as Brooke walks through that door, we'll be headed for the Stella Maris and a lifetime of wedded bliss.",
        "Steffy: You're not married yet. Brooke is still with my dad. And she's been with him for a while.",
        "Bill: She's saying a final goodbye. Leave it to Mr. Drama to drag out his final curtain call.",
        "Nicole: I can't do this anymore.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Maya: You don't mean that.",
        "Nicole: I don't want to believe it, either. But when I think about Zende and Sasha in bed together... now she's defending him, telling me what a great guy he is and how I shouldn't give up on him.",
        "Maya: When did this happen?",
        "Nicole: Earlier.",
        "Maya: Did she apologize?",
        "Nicole: Of course she did. And Zende did, too. Over and over again. But it doesn't change what happened. Or how I feel about it.",
        "Sasha: Say, you know, rick says that our shoot for the European press is getting a lot of buzz. He even wants to set up another one. [Clears throat] Zende?",
        "Zende: Sorry.",
        "Sasha: [Sighs] No, I'm sorry. Can't pretend like this is okay, because it's just not.",
        "Zende: You were saying something about rick. What was it?",
        "Sasha: You were thinking about Nicole. I get that you're concerned about her. But if she's not willing to give you another chance, then maybe it's time for you to move on.",
        "Nicole: Am I wrong for feeling this way? I know Zende loves me. And he and Sasha weren't being malicious or vindictive.",
        "Maya: But they hurt you.",
        "Nicole: And they feel terrible about it.",
        "Maya: I'm sure they do. And rick and I shouldn't have asked you to be our surrogate again. But what Sasha did was wrong, Nicole. This is not the first time that she has targeted Zende, and doing it again? She went way too far.",
        "Zende: It's not just Nicole. I feel bad for you. This could mess up everything, your relationship with Nicole, I mean, our friendship.",
        "Sasha: Hey, don't feel bad on my account or on Nicole's account, either. She's not even looking at the whole situation. If she hadn't agreed to be Maya and Rick's surrogate and give them yet another baby --",
        "Zende: I can't blame her for that, Sasha.",
        "Sasha: Hey, come on, stop.",
        "Zende: What we did --",
        "Sasha: Stop beating yourself up about this. I won't let you do it anymore, Zende.",
        "Bill: We are out of here. Once Brooke dumps your father, we will be off to St. Barts.",
        "Steffy: You're not gonna stop by the courthouse, get the wedding out of the way?",
        "Bill: Hell no. We're getting married on the yacht.",
        "Steffy: And risk my dad showing up on a speedboat? Rowing up on a -- what? -- A dinghy? [Chuckles]",
        "Bill: Well, that's why I have water cannons installed all over the perimeter of the ship.",
        "Steffy: Okay. [Chuckles]",
        "Bill: Seriously. I have been patient. More than that, I've been realistic. I've given Brooke the time she needed to resolve her residual feelings for Ridge, particularly with R.J. back in the picture. She's dealing with that right now, and once she does, nobody will ever come between us again.",
        "Steffy: Look at you. You're so positive.",
        "Bill: I've waited a long time for this moment. And I can't wait to toast my wife with our feet in the sand.",
        "[Seagulls calling]",
        "Brooke: You did this for me?",
        "Ridge: R.J. and me. We did this to remind you of everything that we share.",
        "Brooke: R.J. helped?",
        "Ridge: Yep. Just the two of us with our bare hands.",
        "Brooke: Uh...no, you didn't.",
        "Ridge: No, we didn't, but we could've. He's your biggest fan. And he didn't want to intrude because he knows how important this moment is, and I think you know how important this moment is. It's our moment. This could be the beginning of our next chapter. If that's what you want.",
        "Nicole: As far as Sasha's concerned, this is all my fault.",
        "Maya: Because we asked you to be our surrogate?",
        "Nicole: She says I pushed Zende right into her arms.",
        "Sasha: I understand you're upset.",
        "Zende: I am. So is Nicole. I mean, this whole situation is just so messed up.",
        "Sasha: And you think it's your responsibility to fix it just because that's the kind of wonderful guy you are.",
        "Zende: I don't like hurting people.",
        "Sasha: No one likes the situation, Zende. But honestly, at least now you know.",
        "Zende: Know what?",
        "Sasha: What your life would be like with Nicole. I mean, she put you through the wringer again and again, and you were just supposed to be okay with it? Your opinions, your feelings didn't matter?",
        "Zende: Look, Nicole's not having the baby for Maya anymore. She changed her mind.",
        "Sasha: Ugh! Again! Because this is what she does. I mean, without any regard to how you feel about it. It's like, \"another baby? Sure. I mean, my boyfriend's probably not down with that, but, eh, whatever.\" What's next?",
        "Zende: Nothing. She broke up with me.",
        "Sasha: Well... now you can be with the kind of woman you deserve, a woman who will put your needs first.",
        "Steffy: This is a very different side of you.",
        "Bill: Well, it's been a long time since I've been this happy.",
        "Steffy: I like it.",
        "Bill: Get used to it. It's the new me. Dollar Bill 2.0.",
        "Steffy: Well, Brooke is lucky. She's very lucky she didn't get stuck with the last version.",
        "Bill: Oh, come on! Was I that bad?",
        "Steffy: [Chuckles]",
        "Bill: Look, uh, Brooke didn't have to give me a second chance after she felt that I left her at the altar. And, of course, your old man's been doing everything he can to make inroads with her. But she knows that what I'm offering her and that what we share is something that will last a lifetime. And that's why she's saying goodbye to Ridge and becoming Mrs. Bill Spencer.",
        "Ridge: I know I'm not making this easy on you.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] No, you're not.",
        "Ridge: But you don't get that upset by it.",
        "Brooke: That was a beautiful gesture.",
        "Ridge: It's more than that. This is us. This is our beach, our heart, our son. We're connected.",
        "Brooke: Always will be.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, always. I know life takes us different directions sometimes, but we're always part of each other's lives, you know? I don't know, sometimes our heads get turned and we make promises to people that we really can't keep because, in the end, we always end up here. It's not about Bill. It's not about me. This is about children. How happy you think R.J. would be if he saw his family back together, his parents back together? And how happy would everybody else be if they didn't have to explain to will that his stepmother is also his aunt?",
        "Brooke: [Sighs]",
        "Ridge: It's complicated, and I know it bothers you. More than anything else, I want you to be happy. We can do that. We can fix all of this. So go back to Bill. Take off this God-awful ring and tell him it's over. Then you come home to me. We can be a family.",
        "Maya: Sasha obviously has an agenda. She wants to be with Zende.",
        "Nicole: Yeah, but she told me to take him back. This is my last chance. If I don't take him back now, all bets are off. She'll consider Zende fair game.",
        "Maya: Do you want him back?",
        "Nicole: I want things to go back to the way they were. I love Zende, and I don't want to lose him. But I can't trust him. After what I saw... [Sighs] I know he's sorry, Maya. If he could, he would take it back. And I wish he could. But it happened. He made a choice that he regrets. But now it's time for me to make my own decision. I can't be with someone who could do that to me.",
        "Sasha: You deserve to be appreciated.",
        "Zende: Everyone deserves that.",
        "Sasha: Okay. I'm not gonna bad-mouth Nicole, all right? This is about you. But, Zende, you deserve to be with a woman who's realistic about life and who understands that people aren't perfect. It's okay to lighten up and have fun. You should find a woman who loves to go on adventures. You deserve that. Who actually enjoys the fact that life is unpredictable and you don't know what's gonna come next. That sounds good, doesn't it?",
        "Zende: Yeah. But it's not that simple. I can't just...move on.",
        "Sasha: [Sighs]",
        "Steffy: Well, uh, I should get out of here. Tell Liam I stopped by.",
        "Bill: Brooke and I could be long gone before he gets back.",
        "Steffy: I hope not. Liam's gonna want to say bon voyage.",
        "Bill: What about you?",
        "Steffy: I already know how happy you are and how excited you are, and I already wish you all the best. But I think you might be setting yourself up.",
        "Bill: I'm not.",
        "Steffy: You want to know how many times I heard that from my mom? Take it from me. Don't underestimate the connection between Dad and Brooke.",
        "R.J.: Come on! Just tell me. What happened? Did she end things with Spencer?",
        "Bill: I can't say it enough. Spare no expense. Stock it like we're headed to a desert island.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Bill: I want Brooke to feel like -- like we're the only two people on the planet. We'll see you soon. Jet's ready to go. Stella Maris is in final prep. I've talked to the captain. I told him to get his speech ready so we can get married the second we get on board. Everything's ready to go. I just have to call for my car and we're out of here. You talked to Ridge?",
        "Brooke: Yeah, I did.",
        "Bill: Well, I'm sure he took it hard. But he'll get over it. He's got his father and Quinn to worry about, so he'll mope around for a few days and then he'll be in full control-freak mode. Good news is, you don't have to deal with that, because you're gonna be on a ship with me sailing into paradise. No more of us worrying about how our feelings affect everyone else. We can just be focused on us, what we mean to each other, and the kind of future we're going to have together, because we can make it anything we want it to be. And it starts right now.",
        "Nicole: [Sighs]",
        "Zende: Be my wife, Nicole. Say you'll marry me. Say yes, and we can overcome anything. Nicole?",
        "Zende: I know how you feel about me. I appreciate what you're trying to do here.",
        "Sasha: Look, you're blaming yourself for something that's not even your fault.",
        "Zende: I can't excuse what I did. Right, turning to you when Nicole and I were having problems, that wasn't fair to anyone. And I made a bad situation worse.",
        "Sasha: I get it, okay? You feel like you screwed up. You made a choice based on some bad information, but that does not make you an awful person. And it also doesn't give Nicole the right to make you feel like one.",
        "Zende: I can't.",
        "Sasha: Okay. Well, you know how to reach me. I'm here for you, Zende.",
        "R.J.: She had to be moved. I mean, the heart in the sand was a great idea.",
        "Ridge: I told her you helped me.",
        "R.J.: She saw me? I tried to keep my distance. I didn't want to interrupt.",
        "Ridge: You didn't interrupt.",
        "R.J.: So, what happened?",
        "Ridge: I, uh, I'm not sure. Your mom and I, we have our own way of communicating, you know. We don't always need words. We're just standing there and... just thinking about our history, thinking about our past, thinking about our future, what it should have been, what it could still be. And I just wanted to tell her how much I loved her and... how I want to have a life with her. Did she hear me? I hope so, son. I hope so.",
        "Bill: It's a big day. It's okay to feel emotional. I'm sure during the wedding ceremony, the tears are gonna be flowing. But once we get the captain under control, then you can start crying, too.",
        "Brooke: [Chuckles]",
        "Bill: [Chuckles] We can feel whatever we want to feel. We can do whatever we want to do. And we can say whatever we want to say.",
        "Brooke: I love you.",
        "Bill: Yeah. Just like that.",
        "Brooke: And I want you to know how much you mean to me.",
        "Bill: I do.",
        "Brooke: But I need you to hear it. I need you to know how important you are to me. And I really appreciate how much I've learned from you about courage and passion and not hiding from the truth, building me up and letting me be a better version of myself. You inspire me with your strength and your -- your stubbornness.",
        "Bill: [Chuckles]",
        "Brooke: I really mean all that. I... I don't know if I'm saying this right.",
        "Bill: You couldn't be saying it more right. That's pretty good stuff, though. You might want to save some of that for the wedding vows. Listen to me. You're not being selfish. I'm sure Ridge tried to make you feel that you are. But your happiness is just as important as his or R.J.'S.",
        "Brooke: No, it's not that.",
        "Bill: R.J.'s your son. And after we get married, he's still going to be your family. And that's the point that Ridge should be driving home instead of making these last-ditch efforts to win you back. I know you want everyone to be okay with this. And they will be eventually. But today -- today is about you and me, our getting married. And I want you to feel as happy and as excited as I am. I love you, and I can't wait to make you my wife.",
        "Brooke: [Voice breaking] And I love you, too. And I always will. But...",
        "Bill: \"But\" what, Brooke? Brooke. Don't tell me that he got in your head.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs]",
        "Bill: Did he bring R.J. into this? He convinced you to postpone the wedding? [Sighs] Brooke, no. Come on. Whatever Forrester said, you -- you got to forget it! All this -- what? -- Nonsense about fate and destiny and -- they're just words. He's toying with your emotions. Brooke, he doesn't really want you back. He just doesn't want you to be with me! And that's what this is about. You and me. We're getting married. We are starting our future together. We're gonna get on that jet, we're gonna fly to the Stella Maris, and we are going to say our wedding vows. Tell me you want that. Tell me you still want to be my wife."
