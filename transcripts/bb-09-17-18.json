    "Recap": [
        "Brooke tells Bill that he cannot kiss her like that. He is stunned but promises it will not happen again. She says good; she is a married woman and intends to stay that way. He says he is feeling so many things but he cannot say them out loud. Eric sits and hears the details of the cut-off-at-the-knees Hope For The Future. He just wants to find out if Thorne still has a job. Ridge quips he will be helping Quinn but she laughs and says no. Ridge finally says yes he will still be designing for HFTF. Katie is shocked. She and Thorne have not even dated. He says who needs that. He never thought he would have another chance but he wants her to marry him. She says she admits she has thought about a future with him, but she knows how he feels about Bill so he does not have to do this to get her out of this predicament. He says he must have lost his touch. He thinks they are a good fit and he is not doing this because of the custody with Bill. He loves her. She says nothing is an open and shut case with Bill so do not count on that. There has been water under the bridge with Brooke and sometimes that bridge cannot be crossed again. She kisses him and he slips the ring on her finger and says she must have said yes.",
        "Bill tells Brooke that he understands something now that he did not before. He is not talking to Liam, barely tolerated by Wyatt working side by side with him and now Will wants nothing to do with him. He cannot live like that. He destroyed Liam's marriage and now he is paying the price for that. She says she knows he loves Will and needs to be in his life. He needs to keep trying and she will with Katie. Ridge feels like he needs to get Thorne on the phone and see if he is still in with his designing. Ridge reaches Thorne and he is in bed with Katie. Eric asks if he caught him in the middle of anything. Thorne goes well, he just asked Katie to marry him. They are all surprised but thrilled. Eric says they will see him tomorrow and fill him in on the line. Bill tells Justin that he is not giving any more. He has given all he can on the divorce so he and Brooke are going to keep working on Katie. Thorne and Katie discuss where they might live so not to take Will away from home and his school. She says she always wanted to marry Prince Charming .someone who knows right from wrong, who treats everyone the same no matter who they are and someone who she can trust. Brooke and Ridge get into it again about Bill and she says Will does not need protection from his father. Ridge grouses that Bill has done many bad things to everyone he knows including himself by throwing him out of a helicopter and leaving him there in the water to die. Brooke is not doing Katie any favors by talking to her. Stay away from that guy and; stop defending him!"

        "Brooke: Bill! You can't kiss me like that.",
        "Bill: I was just... [ Sighs ] Grateful. Who's on my side these days? Nobody. Nobody but you.",
        "Brooke: Look, if you want help with this custody mess --",
        "Bill: I-I do. I-I do. I apologize. It won't happen again.",
        "Brooke: No, it won'T. Because I'm a married woman, and I intend to stay that way.",
        "Eric: Good job getting us lean and mean again.",
        "Ridge: Thank you.",
        "Eric: What I'm not clear on, though, is, uh, now that you've cut off hope for the future at the knees --",
        "Ridge: Wait, wait. No. You're not clear? We -- we talked about this on the phone. You know exactly what that is.",
        "Eric: No, of course. I know. I know I do.",
        "Ridge: It's scaled back.",
        "Eric: My question is, does your brother still have a job?",
        "Ridge: Yes, he has a job. He's gonna be quinn's assistant.",
        "Quinn: What? No! He's not. He's not. He's kidding.",
        "Ridge: Yes, thorne is still designing for hope for the future.",
        "Eric: Good. Let's get him in here. Let's see what he's come up with.",
        "Ridge: He's, uh, been playing hooky lately.",
        "Eric: Well, he's probably a little upset at your decisions regarding the allocations.",
        "Quinn: Oh, I think it has to do with our next-door neighbor.",
        "Katie: [ Exclaims ] Thorne, please get up.",
        "Thorne: Oh. Oh, that... doesn't sound like a yes.",
        "Katie: [ Sighs ] I-isn't this too soon? I mean, we're -- we're only dating.",
        "Thorne: Well, it's a little more than -- than dating.",
        "Katie: I do love you. I... I do. More than I thought I was ready to.",
        "Thorne: I mean, we're not -- we're not kids anymore.",
        "Katie: Which is why we shouldn't be impulsive.",
        "Thorne: Ha! What, you think i just walk around with a diamond ring in case I feel like proposing to someone?",
        "Katie: Um, I don't know. You forresters do get married an awful lot.",
        "Thorne: Oh, no. That's not me. That's -- that's my brother.",
        "Katie: [ Laughs ]",
        "Thorne: Look, I never thought I would get another chance like this, and i don't want it to slip away. You know, words that never get said, time wasted because we thought there'd be more, or something better. But waiting only makes sense when you know what you're waiting for, when you see it. And I do, katie. I do. \u00faMarry me.",
        "Katie: I will admit that I have thought about a future with you. And what I would say if you asked me this question.",
        "Thorne: I definitely imagined you would say yes a little faster.",
        "Katie: [ Chuckles ] I just -- I need you to hear me when I say that you don't have to do this. I know you love will, and... you don't have to marry me just because it's gonna look good in family court.",
        "Ridge: I don't want to nag about thorne not being here. He's helping katie get ready for the custody battle with bill.",
        "Eric: Well, however it turns out, dollar bill -- isn't that what he calls himself?",
        "Ridge: Yeah.",
        "Eric: ...Is gonna be hovering.",
        "Ridge: He can hover all he wants, as long as it's not around steffy or my wife.",
        "Brooke: I've been out of the office too long.",
        "Bill: Say you took a late lunch.",
        "Brooke: What? I'm not gonna start lying to my husband.",
        "Bill: Well, is that really any different than -- how mad are you?",
        "Brooke: I know you're feeling panicked about losing access to your boy.",
        "Bill: Yes. I'm feeling so many things I can't say out loud.",
        "Thorne: Wow. I-I must be doing this all wrong.",
        "Katie: No. No, you're not. You're not.",
        "Thorne: No, really. Because if I'm making this proposal sound like a legal strategy, then, yes. I'm just gonna close this.",
        "Katie: Oh!",
        "Thorne: Look [Sighs] Katie, I love you. And I see my future with you and -- you and will. And I would want to be a family even if it was just the two of us. Because we fit. We don't finish each other's sentences, but a lot of the time I know what you're gonna say before you even say it.",
        "Katie: Heh...",
        "Thorne: I just kind of wish this was one of those times.",
        "Katie: [ Laughs ] [ Sighs ] I-I can't guarantee that I'm a sure bet, because sometimes I feel a little lost.",
        "Thorne: You do?",
        "Katie: Well, two marriages to bill, and [Sighs] Two divorces. I felt like I-I couldn't be sure if I -- I knew people, especially people that I'd known all my life, because they seemed to be able to hurt me so easily.",
        "Thorne: You mean your sister.",
        "Katie: Yeah, well, I guess that's all water under the bridge, as they say. It's just sometimes those bridges get washed out. Wyatt helped. He did. And -- and work helped. And... and you've helped. I mean, I never thought that I would go toe-to-toe with bill ever again, but here I am. I'm doing it. And... and I don't think I would be able to if I didn't know that you had my back.",
        "Thorne: Well, I do. But you don't need me. Any judge will see that this is an open-and-shut case.",
        "Katie: Nothing is open-and-shut, not with bill. I -- I want things in my life.",
        "Thorne: Like what?",
        "Katie: [ Sighs ] I want to realize all of my ambitions. I want to live up to the talent that I know I have, and the strength that I know I have. I want to see things and -- and -- and have work that excites me, and still be able to come home to a family life that feeds me. With my son and... and with you. And maybe with the children that -- that we have.",
        "Thorne: Heh... wait. Did you just give me an answer and I missed it?",
        "Katie: I want things in my life, and one of those things is you. Mm! Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Did I say yes? Because I meant to say yes. [ Both laugh ] Yes.",
        "Thorne: Okay. Um... can I...",
        "Katie: Yes.",
        "Thorne: ...Put the ring on your finger?",
        "Katie: Please. Please put that ring on my finger.",
        "Eric: So, what is this about?",
        "Ridge: Uh, it's just -- it's a press release. It's not very good. Katie will fix it.",
        "Quinn: Is it about bill?",
        "Ridge: Sure is.",
        "Eric: Well, where? I mean, I don't see bill's name here anywhere.",
        "Ridge: I know. He loves seeing his name in print, so we didn't put it in there. This is more a reminder for our suppliers and our clients, to show them that forrester is forrester again. Spencer is out. The toothless dragon has been slain.",
        "Brooke: I should go.",
        "Bill: I understand something that I didn't before. And I'm sorry that it took me crossing the line with you for me to understand it. But I -- [ Sighs ] You wouldn't want to hear it.",
        "Brooke: Try me.",
        "Bill: I know where everything went wrong in my life -- right when I was becoming the man I wanted to be. I mean, I had liam and wyatt working here by my side. Katie and I had gotten to a place where she had accepted and come to peace with our parting, and I had my youngest son. I had will, who looked up to me, and he trusted me, and... [ Sighs ] I was happy. And I was in love.",
        "Brooke: What happened?",
        "Bill: I lost you.",
        "Brooke: [ Sighs ] Bill, I had my reasons. You were out of control. You were obsessed with that tower. Getting it built no matter what, at the expense of others, especially liam. I couldn't be around that.",
        "Bill: I'm not blaming you. But maybe if you'd stayed, you could have steered me in the right direction. I wouldn't have spiraled the way that I did. But instead I -- I doubled down, went after steffy, ruined my relationship with liam. Destroyed his marriage. And in the process, I ignored will. And now I'm paying the price from that.",
        "Brooke: I still have reservations about you. What could allow you to do the things that you've done? But you know what? I really do think you've done the worst. I think that you've hit rock bottom. You're a good father, bill. You love your son. You need to be there. You need to be in his life. I'm not gonna give up on katie. I'm gonna keep trying.",
        "Bill: Thank you, brooke.",
        "Ridge: Here. Maybe you can look at these projections now that you're back from what I assume was a late lunch.",
        "Brooke: Oh, I wasn't at lunch. I had some errands. So what are these projections?",
        "Ridge: These are production goals for intimates.",
        "Brooke: Oh. Well, I don't need to look at that.",
        "Eric: As for this decision, I just want to be sure thorne doesn't feel slighted --",
        "Ridge: Thorne! Okay. You know what? Would you feel better if i got him on the phone right now? Do you want to do that?",
        "Eric: Yes, thank you.",
        "Ridge: Great.",

        "Katie: [ Giggles ] Ohh. Really?",
        "Thorne: It's ridge.",
        "Katie: Mm. Are we in trouble?",
        "Thorne: Should we answer it?",
        "Katie: Yeah, let's answer it.",
        "Thorne: Okay.",
        "Katie: [ Chuckles ]",
        "Thorne: Hey, ridge.",
        "Bill: I'm here with dad, quinn, and brooke. You're on speaker.",
        "Thorne: It's -- it's ridge and dad, with quinn and brooke.",
        "Katie: Oh.",
        "Thorne: Should we tell them?",
        "Katie: Yeah, let's tell them.",
        "Eric: Uh, thorne, did we catch you in the middle of anything?",
        "Thorne: More like the beginning of something. I have some news. I asked katie to marry me.",
        "Eric: [ Chuckles ]",
        "Ridge: Ha, ha!",
        "Eric: Thorne, that's wonderful.",
        "Brooke: [ Chuckles ] Oh, wow. That's, uh -- that's unexpected.",
        "Thorne: Is it?",
        "Brooke: Yeah. [ Sighs ] Maybe just by me. Congratulations.",
        "Ridge: Wow, this is great. You know all the times I've said that you make bad decisions? You actually made a good one!",
        "Ridge: Uh... come see me tomorrow, and get back to what you were doing.",
        "Thorne: Okay. They're, uh -- they're happy for us.",
        "Katie: Mm, good.",
        "Thorne: And they said that we should get back to whatever we were doing.",
        "Katie: Oh.",
        "Thorne: So...",
        "Katie: What were we doing, again? Oh, that's right.",
        "Bill: Brooke did the best she could.",
        "Justin: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Katie didn't budge?",
        "Bill: Ah, you never know with katie. You tell her something on a tuesday, and she hears it on a friday.",
        "Justin: Well, I mean, if she's so dug in, I mean... never mind. You already said no. Mediation tends to soften people's entrenched positions.",
        "Bill: I'm not doing any \"I give a little, you give a little.\" I gave all I'm gonna give in the divorce. Anyway, brooke's gonna keep working on her.",
        "Justin: She seems very loyal to you.",
        "Bill: I've managed to kill everybody's affection for me. Except for hers. Maybe that's why I lost my head.",
        "Justin: No. Lost your head with steffy. You and brooke were good together.",
        "Bill: No, I mean today.",
        "Justin: What happened today?",
        "Bill: I kissed brooke.",
        "Katie: If you could live anywhere in the world, where would it be?",
        "Thorne: Well, I can live anywhere. I do like this bed.",
        "Katie: [ Giggles ] So you see us staying here?",
        "Thorne: Well, you wouldn't want to take will away from his friends, or take him out of school, right, put him in a new one?",
        "Katie: No, I wouldn'T.",
        "Thorne: Right.",
        "Katie: But I thought it might be a little soon to start laying down conditions.",
        "Thorne: [ Chuckles ] No, I like it here. I want to be close to my dad. That's one of the reasons I came back. You know, I got, uh... a little sick of being the son who had to go away to prove himself.",
        "Katie: [ Sighs ] You will never have to prove yourself to me.",
        "Thorne: No?",
        "Katie: No. Do you know what I've always wanted in my prince charming? I want someone who knows the difference between right and wrong. I want someone who treats everybody the same, no matter who they are. And most of all, I want someone who is willing to give me his trust. And who I feel safe giving my trust in return.",
        "Thorne: That all sounds like me.",
        "Katie: [ Laughs ]",
        "Thorne: Well, I'm no paragon. Sometimes when I think I'm right, I'm actually not. But with this, you and me and will, I know this is right.",
        "Katie: Still, one parent getting married really doesn't make much of a difference in the eyes of the law. I mean, bill looks really good on paper.",
        "Thorne: Well, we know what opponent we're up against. Good things are coming for us, katie. It's already happening.",
        "Justin: Okay, brooke is your very best, if not your only shot at keeping this custody question out of a courtroom. So why in the hell would you risk the chance of her running home to ridge and/or katie and saying you put the moves on her?",
        "Bill: She's not gonna do that.",
        "Justin: Yeah? How do you know?",
        "Bill: Because I told her it would never happen again.",
        "Justin: Mm-hmm.",
        "Ridge: Hey, logan, what's the name of that -- that lady from the flower shop that we use?",
        "Brooke: Oh, uh... gosh. I don't know. I think her name is nola? Let me check.",
        "Ridge: No, that doesn't sound right. I'll -- I'll ask pam. She'll know what it is. I'm, um... just want to get a nice arrangement for katie and thorne, you know, to tell them how happy we are.",
        "Brooke: Do you think that's wise?",
        "Ridge: What do you mean, wise? What do you mean?",
        "Brooke: The relationship is still pretty new.",
        "Ridge: Well, they've known each other for 25 years.",
        "Brooke: Right. So what's the rush? I mean, the whole thing seems so expedient. You know.",
        "Ridge: I-I don't know.",
        "Brooke: Oh, well, I think they're doing this to make it look good for the custody battle.",
        "Ridge: Why are you being so cynical right now?",
        "Brooke: [ Sighs ] There's some things we just don't agree on.",
        "Ridge: We don't agree that -- that bill mistreated his two grown sons, and now he's doing the same thing to a little kid?",
        "Brooke: People do change.",
        "Ridge: Well, some people do. Bill hasn'T. This is katie's son. And I didn't protect my daughter, but I got to take care of this little kid.",
        "Brooke: Will doesn't need protection from his father. Bill loves his son.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, and everything bill loves, he destroys, eventually.",
        "Brooke: Oh, my god. Do you know how vindictive you sound?",
        "Ridge: See, I don't want that. I don't want to sound vindictive. I don't know where that came from. Oh, no. You know what? I do know. Maybe it comes from bill coercing my daughter into sleeping with him. Or maybe it's because he threw me out of a helicopter into the persian gulf and left me there to die. I know he probably didn't mean to do that. Okay. No. You know what? No. It's not okay. Why don't you open your eyes and see who this person really is? He sees any weakness, he's gonna use you. Come on. Stay away from that guy. Stop defending him.",
