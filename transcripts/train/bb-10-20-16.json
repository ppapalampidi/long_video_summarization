        "Quinn sits with Eric and when he asks she says Ridge can be a little intimidating but she can handle him. Eric asks if he threatened her. She says no, but she has changed the security guards so Ridge cannot move her out in the middle of the night. They will only be loyal to them, not Ridge. Later Wyatt comes over and says he is not in the best mood today. She says he does not have to lose Steffy. He can fight, that is the way she raised him. She explains to him the new security team and she will not jeopardize her husband's health even if it is to keep his own son away. As they look in on Eric he says that Quinn needs her son so he wants Wyatt to move in. Donna comes home and stops by Bill's to find out about the wedding. He says they cannot wait any longer for a teenage boy to come around. Ridge and Brooke discuss her needing to marry Bill to get the shares when Brooke tells him that RJ has not come around yet. He still believes she and Ridge ought to be together. Ridge says he thinks that way too. She asks outright if he has feelings for her. He jokes that of course he does. Brooke tells Ridge that Eric will eventually realize what he has done and kick Quinn out. Ridge says they do not have that long; they need to get rid of her now.",
        "Bill tells Donna that once before Ridge stopped him from marrying Brooke but what he cannot stop is their love. Brooke tells Ridge one more time that she is a big girl and she can take care of herself. She's told him before that she would never marry Bill or anyone just to make a business transaction. He tells her there is something about her, his Logan, and he just wants her to be happy. Maybe it is all this talk about memories from RJ but he is thinking about them too. Wyatt is shocked. He says he had his reservations about them as a married couple but this is a lot to think about to actually move in with them. Quinn keeps babbling and trying to get him to say yes. He says he does not hate the idea but he thinks they need a private moment. Carter comes in with a copy of the unsigned marriage license and says they need to take care of that. Wyatt wants to leave but Eric reminds him no one in the family was there for the wedding; he wants him to stay now. Ridge tells Brooke that Bill should not even be allowed to look at her much less to marry her. Bill calls Brooke and says the journey is theirs now so they need to get it done. He will not go back on his word and she can have the shares and hand them over to Ridge if she wants to. She tells Ridge and says that is what she wants. Then he kisses her. Quinn signs the license and then Eric does. He wants Carter to say it \u0096 \"I now pronounce you man and wife and you may kiss the bride.\" Carter says it is official so his work is done. Wyatt says now he knows they need some alone time. Eric tells him stay once again. He wants to even call him son. Wyatt says he is very honored if they both want this. He will move in. Eric thanks him. He says he is sorry Wyatt lost Steffy. He is not as pretty as her but Wyatt has him now."

        "Quinn: Can I get you anything else?",
        "Eric: You look tired.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] Well... I didn't sleep much.",
        "Eric: Something happen?",
        "Quinn: Ridge and I had a... confrontation after he left you.",
        "Eric: He upset you?",
        "Quinn: Ridge can be a little bit intimidating.",
        "Eric: Did he...threaten?",
        "Quinn: No, no, no, no, no. I don't want you to worry about a thing, okay? There's been enough conflict between us and your family.",
        "Eric: Stress.",
        "Quinn: I am feeling a bit vulnerable. I hired a new security team for the estate who won't only be loyal to your family, and so Ridge can't drive a bunch of moving trucks up in the middle of the night and get rid of me. I hope that's okay. I don't want you worrying about this. I can handle myself with Ridge.",
        "Ridge: It's pretty obvious my dad isn't thinking clearly. I practically begged him to sign those power-of-attorney papers.",
        "Brooke: But he didn't?",
        "Ridge: No, he didn't.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs]",
        "Ridge: Got himself all worked up, and then Quinn came in. She got to his side, and once again she ended up on top.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] I'm sorry, Ridge. I know how much you were hoping to get through to Eric.",
        "Ridge: That's not gonna happen. You know what else isn't gonna happen? Quinn running this company, running our family. It's unacceptable. Oh, man, I was trying to avoid this, but... it's kind of up to you now. We need bill's shares more than ever.",
        "[Both laugh]",
        "Bill: It's good to see you. It's been too long.",
        "Donna: It's good to be home.",
        "Bill: How's it been out in the world?",
        "Donna: Oh, fantastic. I mean, it's something I always wanted to do, just travel wherever the urge took me. But after I heard about Eric, I knew it's time to come home.",
        "Bill: Yeah. You've been missed.",
        "Donna: [Sighs]",
        "Bill: And your timing couldn't be better. Your sister's going to need you.",
        "Donna: You mean Brooke.",
        "Bill: I don't know how much you two have been in touch lately, but I want to marry her. Right away.",
        "Quinn: You sure I can't get you something?",
        "Wyatt: No, I'm -- I'm fine.",
        "Quinn: I'm so sorry, honey.",
        "Wyatt: I'm just not in the best mood today.",
        "Quinn: That's understandable. But you don't have to walk away from your marriage. You know, you could fight for Steffy. It's who you are. You're a fighter. That's how I raised you.",
        "Wyatt: Okay, whatever. What's with the new security outside? I don't see any of the regular guys.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] It's a new company. They started today.",
        "Wyatt: You fired Forrester security?",
        "Quinn: They worked for Ridge. I need someone who's gonna be loyal to me.",
        "Wyatt: Okay. What's going on, mom? Are you trying to protect Eric or yourself?",
        "Donna: Brooke told me you were about to get married before R.J. Came home, but she -- she seems to think he needs more time.",
        "Bill: Oh, come on. R.J.'s had enough time. We can't let a teenage boy dictate our lives. R.J. will come around when he realizes he has no choice, that Brooke and I are good together, that I make her happy. I'm done waiting, donna. I want to make Brooke my wife as soon as possible.",
        "Ridge: We need those shares to take control of the company. And you're the only one who can get them. Where do things stand?",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] The same. Bill wants to get married right away, and I want to wait a little bit for R.J.'s sake.",
        "Ridge: Well, you may not be able to wait a little bit.",
        "Brooke: You know how R.J. feels. He thinks that we belong together.",
        "Ridge: Well, he, uh... he makes a lot of sense.",
        "Brooke: Okay, wait. One minute you're telling me to go marry Spencer, and the next you're saying... I don't know what. Do you have feelings for me, Ridge?",
        "Ridge: What? Of course, I have feelings for you. What do you think?",
        "Quinn: I had another run-in with Ridge. He was upstairs alone with Eric. Lord knows what he was even saying about me.",
        "Wyatt: Okay.",
        "Quinn: But he -- [Sighs] He was upsetting Eric, and that's not good for his recovery. And Eric asked him to leave, but he -- he came right down here and he was waiting for me when I came downstairs, barking about what I'm allowed to do, threatening me.",
        "Wyatt: Wait, like a serious threat?",
        "Quinn: I wasn't gonna take any chances. That's why I hired a new security team. If I need to call them, I want to make sure that they're gonna listen to me, not to Ridge. Besides, I can't have him coming over here any time he wants, upsetting Eric. No one gets to jeopardize my husband's health. I don't care if it is his son.",
        "Donna: You and Brooke have waited a long time to be together. You've proven your loyalty, your commitment. Yes, I believe in you.",
        "Bill: Your support means a lot to me and to Brooke. It'll be great to have you with us on our most special day.",
        "[Both chuckle]",
        "Ridge: I need to stop Quinn. But yes, I have feelings for you. I don't -- I don't want to lose you.",
        "Brooke: You can't lose me, Ridge, because you don't have me. I'm marrying Bill.",
        "Ridge: I know. But you can't stay with that clown, so you're gonna divorce him.",
        "Brooke: Divorce him?",
        "Ridge: Yeah, he's gonna say something stupid or do something stupid, and then you'll leave.",
        "Brooke: I-I'm marrying Bill because I love him, because I'm committed to him, not because you need the shares for some takeover that may not even happen. Besides, it might still work out.",
        "Ridge: How?",
        "Brooke: Eric's anger will pass, and he'll realize what he's doing. It's -- it's ridiculous. And he'll kick Quinn to the curb.",
        "Ridge: Quinn is a problem now. We got to get these shares, take over the company, and... and then we'll get on with our lives. But we need to deal with Quinn first. Mr. Forrester's condition is improving every day.",
        "Quinn: Do you hear that, honey?",
        "Eric: Strong like bull.",
        "Quinn: [Laughs] Rest is still vital. He can't do too much too soon.",
        "Quinn: Oh, I'll keep him in check. [Chuckles] Why don't you take a break? My son and I will sit with him. Sounds good, Mrs. Forrester.",
        "Quinn: Thanks. Mrs. Forrester. I love the sound of that. Mrs. Forrester. And so you know, the new security team is in place.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, Mom tells me things got heated with Ridge.",
        "Eric: Out of line.",
        "Quinn: That doesn't matter now. My priority is to keep you safe while you're getting better. But I can use all the support I can get. [Chuckles]",
        "Eric: Move in.",
        "Quinn: Well, I already live here.",
        "Eric: Wyatt. Your mother needs you.",
        "Wyatt: Me?",
        "Eric: Move in.",
        "Bill: So, have you seen Eric?",
        "Donna: Not yet.",
        "Bill: You know you're gonna have to go through Quinn, right?",
        "Donna: I mean, what -- what was he thinking getting involved with that woman?",
        "Bill: The consensus is he wasn't thinking. Regardless, however she did it, Quinn is ensconced.",
        "Donna: We'll see how long that lasts. But in the meantime, we have got a wedding to pull off.",
        "Bill: You know, that day on the beach in Abu Dhabi was supposed to be the beginning for Brooke and me as husband and wife. Of course, it didn't turn out that way because of Ridge stopping the wedding. But what he couldn't stop is our love, because it's real and it's permanent. And he can't touch it.",
        "Brooke: What?",
        "Ridge: I don't know. I-I just can't get that image out of my head, you on the beach in Abu Dhabi getting ready for that wedding ceremony. It's just the idea of you being married to that guy even for a second. And I know it's necessary. We need to get the shares, so I-I get that. It's just, um...",
        "Brooke: Okay. [Chuckles] I want to make something perfectly clear, 'cause I know I've told you this before, but I would never marry Bill or anybody else just for a business transaction. I'm doing it because I love him.",
        "Ridge: That's what you want?",
        "Brooke: Yes. So, you don't have to worry about me. I am a big girl, and I can take care of myself.",
        "Ridge: Yeah?",
        "Brooke: Okay, what -- why are we even talking about this?",
        "Ridge: Because... because there's a lot of memories. We spent a lot of good years together, you know. Now R.J.'s back, and he's bringing up some of those memories, and it just -- and... [Sighs] It doesn't help that you're getting married to...to a guy that I don't care for.",
        "Brooke: Wow. Well, that was the nicest way you ever phrased that.",
        "Ridge: It's just something about you, Logan. I just want you to be okay. I want you to be happy.",
        "Brooke: I am happy, so you can be happy for me because I'm gonna be with Bill. And you should be happy for yourself because you are going to get those shares.",
        "Ridge: I am so happy for me. Get rid of Quinn and everything's back to normal. And you just have a little detour in your life. That's all.",
        "Wyatt: You -- you want me to move in here?",
        "Quinn: Eric, are you serious? I mean, it would be so great to have my son close by again. Well, you could get to know us as a couple. You can -- you can spend time with us.",
        "Wyatt: I got to admit, I had my reservations about you guys at first, but... now I'm starting to think you two are good for each other. It's probably hard to tell, but I am grateful to you, Eric, for accepting my mother and... making her happy.",
        "Eric: No big chore.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles]",
        "Quinn: And -- and we have tons of room. You can even have your own guest house if you want. It -- it would be so, so nice to know that you're close by. And you don't even have to say anything right now. You -- you can think about it and go and come back, and then you can say yes. You could just actually say yes right now.",
        "Wyatt: Mom. I don't hate the idea.",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Carter: There he is.",
        "Eric: Nurse texted him for me.",
        "Carter: This is for you.",
        "Quinn: What is it?",
        "Eric: Open.",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles] Our marriage license?",
        "Eric: Unsigned. Need...to fix that.",
        "Quinn: I can't believe you've been thinking about this.",
        "Eric: Married legally.",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles] You are the best man. Do you have any idea how much I love you? [Chuckles]",
        "Wyatt: Okay, this feels kind of like a private moment. I'm just gonna leave you be, Mr. and Mrs. Forrester.",
        "Eric: No. Stay. My family... left me alone... at our wedding. You stay now.",
        "Wyatt: Are -- are you sure?",
        "Eric: Very sure.",
        "Brooke: Bill is not a detour.",
        "Ridge: You can't be with that guy. He shouldn't even be allowed to look at you, let alone be married to you, so just do me a favor. Just get the shares and then get away from him.",
        "[Ringtone plays]",
        "Ridge: [Sighs] Is that Bill?",
        "Brooke: Hi.",
        "Bill: I catch you in the middle?",
        "Brooke: Uh, no, not -- I can talk.",
        "Bill: I meant what I said, Brooke. No more waiting. I understand that you want to give your son consideration. You'd be more comfortable getting married if R.J. Was all in. We'll get him there. I will make it my mission. But, Brooke, our future is now. We get married, I give you your wedding present, then we're off.",
        "Brooke: So the shares are still on the table, right?",
        "Bill: I gave you my word. I wouldn't go back on it. I'll give you my shares at Forrester and you can hand them over to Ridge if you want to. I want you to be my wife. I love you.",
        "Brooke: I love you, too. So, um, he wants to get married right away, and then I'll be with the man that I love and you will get your shares.",
        "Ridge: And that's it? No talking you out of it?",
        "Brooke: [Chuckles] Ridge, come on.",
        "Ridge: 'Cause that's what you want.",
        "Brooke: Yes.",
        "Ridge: Okay. Okay.",
        "[Monitor beeping]",
        "Quinn: Here you go. You're signing it right there. [Chuckles]",
        "Eric: Say it.",
        "Carter: I now pronounce you husband and wife.",
        "Quinn: Ha ha!",
        "Eric: And?",
        "Carter: And now you may kiss the bride.",
        "Quinn: [Laughs] Hooray!",
        "Eric: My wife.",
        "Quinn: My husband.",
        "Eric: Uh-huh.",
        "Quinn: [Laughs]",
        "Carter: It's official. You're definitely married. My work here is done.",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles]",
        "Eric: Thank you.",
        "Carter: Happy to help.",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles]",
        "Wyatt: Well, uh, thank you guys for letting me be a part of this, but you probably want some alone time, so I'm gonna head out. Congratulations to both of you.",
        "Eric: Thank you... son.",
        "Wyatt: I'm -- I'm sorry?",
        "Eric: I'd like to call you son.",
        "Wyatt: Uh... I don't know what to say to that. I... I'd be honored.",
        "Eric: Good. Now... move in. Help your mother. Support your mother.",
        "Quinn: Oh, that would make me so happy.",
        "Wyatt: This is what you want?",
        "Eric: Yes, it is.",
        "Wyatt: I mean, I guess I could make it work.",
        "Quinn: Really?",
        "Wyatt: Yes. I'll -- I'll -- I'll move in.",
        "Quinn: Oh! That means so much to me! Ohh! Thank you, both of you, for everything.",
        "Wyatt: All right. Well...",
        "Eric: Wyatt. I'm sorry you lost Steffy. Not as pretty, but... you have me now."
