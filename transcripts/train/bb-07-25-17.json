        "Thomas is stunned and can not believe Caroline is dying. It does not make sense. Bill says she told no one else as she did not want to burden them. It is a rare auto immune disease and yes she has seen every specialist there is. He is only telling Thomas because it affects his son, Douglas. Sheila remembers and feels pleased with herself that she was able to kiss Eric. She takes his clothes to have cleaned. She asks if there is anything else she can do. He says no, unless she can turn back the clock \u0096 back to the time before he knew what Quinn was up to. She betrayed him with Ridge, his own son. Sheila laments that she wishes she did not have to be the one to tell him. She is so mad that they had to betray him. He softens and says it was only a few kisses and he is not sure that amounts to an affair. Sheila replies that an emotional affair is just as bad as a physical one. Caroline confides to Steffy that she would be with Thomas right now if she had not pushed him away. She came back now even knowing that Sally is in the picture. Steffy says that is not a problem, she can overcome Sally. Caroline hopes so as she wants her family together.",
        "Thomas wonders if Bill is telling him this to get him to return to his family. Bill says no; Thomas should never have been with Sally in the first place. He will never get that time back and now his only responsibility is to his son and his mother with the time they have left. It will be his son's only lasting memories long after his mother is gone and only Thomas can give him that. Sheila tells Eric that she knows she is not worthy but she is trying so hard to be the woman that he wants. He says he is sorry that too much has happened between them in the past and that is not going to happen again. He does appreciate her coming back and telling him the truth when no one else would. She is a true friend. She says okay she can accept that and she can stay if he wants or she can leave. Quinn grouses to Ridge that this is not good, only Sheila back in Eric's life. Bill tells Thomas that just video chatting with Douglas is not trying to put the family back together. Thomas says of course he still loves Caroline but she left him, but now he has to be there for her. Bill says he has two regrets in his life \u0096 he was not there for his two adult sons growing up and one of their mothers was taken away too soon. He does not want that to happen to him and Caroline. He needs to get rid of this red- headed clown and be with Caroline as soon as possible. Caroline drops in on Bill. Bill says she asked for his help with Tommy boy but the strong arm did not work. He says he will spare her the details but just know that when she goes back to New York she will not be going alone or just with Douglas. Thomas will be with her. She can't imagine how he managed that. He says it was easy. He told Thomas that she was dying. Caroline is livid. Ridge tells Steffy that Quinn is upstairs now resting and he is okay. She says he is not; he is just drinking and hasn't eaten in days. He is mad when Steffy says she has known for days where Eric is when Liam tracked him down. Eric hugs Sheila and she hangs on to him for dear life."

        "Thomas: Caroline's dying? No. No.",
        "Bill: She's very sick.",
        "Thomas: How -- how do you know? That doesn't make sense. It just --",
        "Bill: I know because she told me, Thomas. She didn't want to. But I got it out of her. I could just tell something was wrong. I wanted to help. She doesn't want to be a burden to anyone.",
        "Thomas: Oh, my god.",
        "Bill: It hit me the same way, like it can't be real.",
        "Thomas: Caroline...",
        "Steffy: Okay, just keep me updated, rick. I need everything to come off without a hitch. Okay, bye.",
        "Caroline: Spencer summit?",
        "Steffy: Yeah, rick and Maya are en route to Monaco, so is Zende and Nicole.",
        "Caroline: When is everyone else leaving? 'Cause I don't want to hold you up.",
        "Steffy: Oh, no, you're not. Where's Douglas?",
        "Caroline: Oh, he is playing patty cake with pam. Or some version of it with ingredients that I have no idea about.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, that sounds about right.",
        "Caroline: [Chuckles]",
        "Steffy: How are you doing? Everything with Thomas, I feel for you.",
        "Caroline: I mean, it could be a lot worse, that's for sure. I -- I really do have a lot to be thankful for. I am a mommy to the most amazing little boy, and I have my two moms, and everyone's healthy, and... that should be enough. It would be enough if...",
        "Steffy: If you weren't still in love with my brother.",
        "Quinn: You're not going to Monaco?",
        "Ridge: No, not the way things are with dad right now. I need to have a face- to-face with him, clear the air.",
        "Quinn: Me, too. I want to be here if he decides to come home.",
        "Sheila: I can, uh... I can take these to the dry cleaner for you, if you'd like. I can drop them off today and pick them up tomorrow.",
        "Eric: Yeah, sure, that'll be great.",
        "Sheila: Is there anything else I can do for you?",
        "Eric: How are you at turning back the clock?",
        "Sheila: [Scoffs] I wish that I could. Back to before things went so terribly wrong between us.",
        "Eric: I was thinking more of my past with Quinn, back when I was blissfully unaware of her deception. And my son's.",
        "Sheila: Eric, would you really have not wanted to know?",
        "Eric: No. What's the point of living a lie, really? Besides, everything would have come out in the end, anyway.",
        "Sheila: I just wish I hadn't been put in a position to have to tell you.",
        "Eric: You really believe that, don't you?",
        "Sheila: You don't?",
        "Quinn: I know it isn't helping, but I keep texting him and I keep calling him, but he's not picking up. I think he turned his phone off. I -- I just want him to talk to me.",
        "Ridge: Well, I wish he'd talk to anyone but Sheila. I don't want him confiding in her.",
        "Quinn: With as vulnerable as Eric is right now, god only knows what she's filling his head with.",
        "Caroline: Thomas and I would be together right now if I hadn't pushed him away.",
        "Steffy: You didn't push him away. You needed time to figure things out.",
        "Caroline: But look what it cost me and my son. I came back to L.A. To fix things. I didn't care if sally was in the picture.",
        "Steffy: You know how I feel about sally. I think she's totally wrong for Thomas.",
        "Caroline: I mean, you and I see that, why doesn't he?",
        "Steffy: Maybe he does. Maybe he's just not ready to admit it. You're everything sally isn't and can never be to Thomas. We just have to make Thomas realize that. The sooner, the better.",
        "Thomas: Caroline... she -- she looks healthy, I -- how could she possibly be dying?",
        "Bill: It's a rare auto-immune disease.",
        "Thomas: How do you know? I mean, how -- how could you possibly know? It doesn't make sense.",
        "Bill: [Sighs] Do you think she hasn't seen every specialist possible?",
        "Thomas: Yeah. Of course she has.",
        "Bill: She was adamant that no one know. But given that you are Douglas' father... I felt that you had the right to know.",
        "Eric: I don't think it really makes any difference now, Sheila. I know.",
        "Sheila: No, because I couldn't stand the thought of them betraying you, Eric. Your own wife and son? Oh, my god, I'm still so angry when I think of how they deceived you.",
        "Eric: Look, they said they were on the verge of telling me anyway.",
        "Sheila: Yeah, when? They could have done that at any time. They could have done that after their first kiss, their first indiscretion. They could have come to you. Or anytime after that! But no, they continued with their affair.",
        "Eric: There were kisses. But does that qualify as an affair?",
        "Sheila: I don't know, I think an emotional affair can be just as powerful as a physical one. I don't tell you these things because I'm trying to hurt you. I just think it's important that you see Quinn and ridge for who they really are.",
        "Eric: What about you, Sheila? Who are you? Really.",
        "Caroline: I should let you get back to it. I'm sure you have a million things to do before you catch your flight.",
        "Steffy: More like a million and one. But you and Douglas take priority.",
        "Caroline: You're sweet.",
        "Steffy: Hey, family's everything. Children are everything. And my nephew should be able to count on his father. I know firsthand what it was like to not have both parents in the picture, and I do not want that for Douglas.",
        "Caroline: Well, I'm not giving up, and with you rooting for us, and uncle bill doing what he can, hopefully we can just get our little family back together.",
        "Thomas: Is -- is that what this was about? Is that what this was about, when you showed up to spectra trying to convince me to get back together with Caroline? Is that what this is? You knew she was dying! And I get it -- I get it -- that you didn't want to betray her confidence, but why did you try to strong-arm me into leaving sally and spectra? I know you wanted me to return to my family with Caroline and Douglas. Is that what it is?",
        "Bill: You never should have throw in with those yahoos in the first place. Then you would have time to be in new York with Caroline and your son. You can never get that time back. Now that Caroline is dying. But you can take a look at your life, Thomas, and realize that your only obligation is to your little boy and your son's mother, a woman who is living on borrowed time.",
        "Thomas: How much time does Caroline have?",
        "Bill: I'm not sure. But I am sure of this -- your only responsibility should be to Caroline and Douglas, making happy, lasting, loving memories that your son will have long after his mother is gone. You can do that for Caroline and Douglas, Thomas. Only you.",
        "Sheila: You know who I am, Eric. I'm the woman I want to be for you. I -- I know that I'm not worthy, but I have worked so hard at turning my life around...",
        "Eric: Sheila, I applaud you for that, I really do. Especially given the way things have gone since you came back. We accused you of shooting at Quinn, we put you behind bars, even though it was deacon in the end. I mean, at that point, you could have said, \"to hell with the Forresters,\" but you came to me. You came to me with the truth about what was going on with my wife and ridge. I'M... I'm grateful. You took a bullet from my granddaughter, and you stand up for her. That speaks volumes about our friendship. Look, I'm sorry... but too much has happened in our past for us to have anything like we had before. That's just not gonna happen. I'm -- I'm sorry.",
        "Sheila: Yeah, I'm -- I'm just glad to hear you call me a friend. That means the world to me. Look, I -- I can stay if you want me to, or I -- I can leave if you don't.",
        "Eric: I don't know what I want. I just don't know.",
        "Ridge: Listen, even if Sheila were pulling the strings...",
        "Quinn: She is pulling the strings. She came here to get his medication, she has a key to the house. She's the only person who knows where he is, and she isn't saying!",
        "Ridge: Because dad told her not to.",
        "Quinn: I should have followed her.",
        "Ridge: If you found him, he would run.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] So this horrible woman, his ex-wife, is now his confidant? No. This isn't good, ridge! This isn't good at all!",
        "Steffy: We're pulling for you. Even your uncle.",
        "Caroline: What?",
        "Steffy: It's just that bill's used to getting what he wants, and... I just don't want him bullying my brother, that's all.",
        "Caroline: Well, I don't want that, either. I mean, Thomas has to want to come back to us. I mean, otherwise, it doesn't work. And I'm sure my uncle understands that. Doesn't he?",
        "Bill: If you're feeling guilty about all the missed opportunities with Caroline and Douglas, I don't want to rub salt in the wound, but you should. They're your family, and you abandoned them.",
        "Thomas: That's not true.",
        "Bill: Really? You think that, uh, video-chatting with your son makes up for not being there?",
        "Thomas: Damn it, bill! I wanted a family with Caroline! I wanted that, but it was too soon for her. That's why she left me for new York!",
        "Bill: Wow, so you're putting all this on Caroline?",
        "Thomas: No! I'm not putting any of this on her! She is dying! This isn't helping! The mother of my child is dying. The woman who I --",
        "Bill: Still love?",
        "Thomas: Yes! I still love her!",
        "Bill: Then you know what you have to do. You have to be there for Caroline and Douglas. You have to be the husband and father you should have been all along.",
        "Thomas: [Sighs] Oh, man... you're right. You're right. I have to be there for Caroline and Douglas.",
        "Bill: You got sucked in by that redhead who played you like a violin. Can I share something with you, Thomas? My greatest regret -- actually, there are two. I wasn't there for my adult sons when they were growing up. I missed out on so much with them. I mean, sure, they -- they had their mothers. But soon... way too soon, Douglas isn't going to have his. So every day he has with her, every day he has with the three of you as a family is precious. Caroline's specialists are all in new York. She has to be there. And you have to be there for Caroline and Douglas.",
        "Thomas: New York?",
        "Bill: As soon as possible.",
        "Caroline: Hey.",
        "Bill: Hey!",
        "Caroline: Wanted to see me right away?",
        "Bill: Yeah, come on in! Where's Douglas?",
        "Caroline: Oh! Alison and Amy are fighting over who's gonna read him a story.",
        "Bill: [Laughs]",
        "Caroline: So, what's up?",
        "Bill: You asked me for some help, right? To give Tommy boy a much-needed push in your direction.",
        "Caroline: So...",
        "Bill: So, I admit, it was a head-scratcher, even for me. You know, the strong- arm tactic didn't work. But then it occurred to me -- a way to reel Thomas in without him having any idea what was happening.",
        "Caroline: [Sighs] I'm almost afraid to ask.",
        "Bill: I'll spare you the details. All you need to know is this -- when you had back to new York, Thomas Forrester will be going with you. With you and Douglas. And not just for a visit, to stay. I guarantee it.",
        "Caroline: Oh, my god, are you serious?",
        "Bill: You might say \"as a heart attack.\" Give your uncle bill a hug.",
        "Caroline: Oh!",
        "Bill: [Chuckles]",
        "Caroline: [Sighs] How'd you do it?",
        "Bill: Simple. I told him you were dying.",
        "Bill: It's Caroline. She's dying, Thomas.",
        "Sheila: Look, at least you have time to figure out what and who you want without the pressure of your family. As long as Steffy and Liam, they don't give up your secret and go to Quinn and ridge with your whereabouts... they wouldn't do that, would they?",
        "Ridge: Quinn is starting to fall apart. If we don't find dad soon...",
        "Steffy: Where is she?",
        "Ridge: I told her to go upstairs, get some rest, but she's probably texting him, waiting by the phone. She hasn't slept since he disappeared.",
        "Steffy: What about you?",
        "Ridge: I'm okay.",
        "Steffy: No, you're not. You haven't eaten and slept in days.",
        "Ridge: Well, I will eat and sleep when I find my father. Right now, it's important to stay hydrated. [Exhales sharply]",
        "Steffy: I've seen granddad.",
        "Ridge: You've seen him? Where? At the office?",
        "Steffy: No, I -- I know where he's staying.",
        "Ridge: You found him?",
        "Steffy: Liam found him. He tracked him down with his...",
        "Ridge: Okay, when did this happen?",
        "Steffy: A few days ago.",
        "Ridge: And you're telling me now?",
        "Steffy: I -- granddad doesn't want you to know where he is.",
        "Ridge: Well, I need to know where he is. Is he with Sheila?",
        "Steffy: Yeah, he's with Sheila."
