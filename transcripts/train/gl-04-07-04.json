        "Danny and Michelle are shocked when they look at the TV and see that Danny is the projected winner of the race. Bill arrives and informs Danny that Ross is already grumbling about the last minute influx of votes from Fifth Street. Danny goes to greet well wishers but Jeffrey is waiting and asks to speak to him, alone. Back in the suite, Jeffrey informs him that he needs him to go undercover in the mob. Over Danny's protests, Jeffrey tells Danny that he has evidence that Danny used dirty money to fund his company and that Cassie Winslow unwittingly took out government loans for him that could land her in trouble. Danny is furious to see that he is trapped into doing what Jeffrey demands. Following Reva's vision, Rick examines Maryanne's exhumed body with Frank and Harley as witnesses. They are surprised to see that she was buried in the method of ancient Egyptians and her body is remarkably well preserved. Rick discovers ligature marks on the neck and a crushed windpipe that convinces them she died of strangulation, and not by drowning. Reva is recovering in the emergency room from the effects of her regression. She wakes to find Carrie bending over her trying to strangle her. Josh bursts into the room just in time and Frank and Harley take Carrie into custody, leaving Josh and Reva together, relieved to know that it's finally over."

        "Michelle: You think there's a lot of people waiting for us downstairs.",
        "Danny: Who cares.",
        "Michelle: (Laughs) well, I would assume that you'd care... since the night would be the night you become the mayor of springfield.",
        "Danny: Nope. Uh-uh. I'm right where I want to be. There will be plenty of time later for celebrating or crying... depending on what happens.",
        "Michelle: You know, whatever happens, I'm very proud of you. Everybody is.",
        "Danny: As long as you are and robbie, that's all I care about.",

        "Danny: No. Why? So I could hear how I'm trailing ross and by how many points? No thanks. Nope. Mm-mm. You're right. You know, I put up a good fight. Obviously the people were not to take a chance on me. They wanted a known commodity. Somebody...",

        "Danny: No. How did it turn around?",
        "Bill: You know what made the difference?",
        "Danny: How did it turn around? I mean the last time we checked we were down four points.",
        "Bill: Fifth street. Never mind. Fifth street made all the difference in the world. Enough to take you over the top. 200. You won by 200 votes.",
        "Danny: 200 points? That's not... I mean that's not a lot.",
        "Bill: Danny, enough to win,",

        "Bill: Okay, it's just the core group down there.",
        "Michelle: How many people",
        "Danny: Yeah, who's there?",
        "Bill: Don't worry about. Just the core group. Everyone else is down at fifth street, all right. We'll head over there later, okay?",
        "Michelle: All right.",
        "Bill: Let's go.",
        "Danny: Lead the way. You lead the way. Lead the way.",
        "Michelle: Wait, danny!",
        "Ross: Now I think we can safely say that it's over.",
        "Blake: No, it's not over until all the precincts have been counted, ross.",
        "Ross: Like they wouldn't have projected danny to be the winner unless they had the numbers to back it up. They... (phone ringing) bob harrington. Robert, what's happening? Which district? What a surprise. What are the numbers? How many? Okay, you go do what you have to do. I'll call you back in a little bit. My campaign manager said that we were still ahead until the district that includes fifth street, those votes came in and then... well, danny's still only projected to win by some 200 votes, I guess.",
        "Blake: Well, that's not much at all. Of course, we always thought that fifth street would go to him.",
        "Ross: Here's the interesting part. The very interesting part. That district, tonight they had the highest voter turnout in the history of springfield. It was an abnormally large turn out.",
        "Blake: What are you thinking?",
        "Ross: I'm thinking the election committee should make sure that those votes came from living registered voters. People who actually went to the polls.",
        "Blake: Are you saying that you think danny's capable of voting fraud?",
        "Ross: I honestly don't know that, but if it's not danny himself, perhaps someone in his organization. I'm not saying that that's what happened. I'm jut saying we should check it out.",
        "Blake: So what do we do in the meanwhile?",
        "Ross: I'm going to go to the towers and rally the troops. I'm going to wave and smile and the election is too close to call. And then I'm going to look them in the eye and say, \"don't you ever, ever give up hope.\"",
        "Blake: Lead the way.",
        "Rick: Well, how about that? Would you like to do the honors?",
        "Harley: Thanks a lot.",
        "Rick: You're welcome. My darling, maryanne, this is the only way you'll stay forever safe, forever beautiful, forever innocent and young. This woman was so sick.",
        "Frank: Yeah, well, we already know that.",
        "Rick: Let's see what else we got here. The body is obviously very well preserved.",
        "Frank: You've already said that.",
        "Rick: It bears... well, bears repeating, frank. Let's see what else we got here. There appears to be severe ligature marks around the neck area.",
        "Harley: There are?",
        "Rick: Uh-huh. And it looks as if this victims windpipe has been crushed.",
        "Frank: What?",
        "Harley: She was strangled. Reva was right. Reva said that when dr. Langham hypnotized her, she saw carrie strangling maryanne.",
        "Rick: I got something embedded here. Something here one of the ligature marks.",
        "Frank: What is it? What is that?",
        "Rick: Looks like a fiber, possibly silk. We'll know for sure we get the lab report back. Here we go.",
        "Harley: Reva said that she saw carrie strangle maryanne with a shawl that she was wearing that night. It was a black silk shawl.",
        "Frank: Looks like reva really nailed it, right?",
        "Rick: Yep.",
        "Frank: So you're going to open her up?",
        "Rick: Yes. Take a look at the lungs here. But I'm 99% sure that the victim was strangled.",
        "Frank: Sis, come on, are you going to watch this? Come on.",
        "Harley: You guys go on without me. Here, frank, take this. I got to check on something. I'll be right back.",
        "Gus: All right, cool. That sounds good and everything. Just let me see the stuff.",
        "Drug dealer: It should sound good. (Phone rings) it doesn't get any better.",
        "Gus: I want to see. It's my chick. Hold a second. Let me get rid of her. Hey, babe, this is not a very good time.",
        "Harley: When is it ever a good time for us lately? Listen this is getting crazier and crazier.",
        "Gus: Babe, listen.",
        "Harley: Shut up and listen to me. I was just in the autopsy room with rick and he was cutting into a mummified body. I mean, it was a real mummy. It was wrapped up and everything. This qualifies as the weirdest thing that's ever happened to me in my life. And listen to this. Reva said that she had this dream...",
        "Gus: Honey, look, this is not a really good time, okay. Can we talk about this later? Damn! I got to go, because I just lost something, okay, but I'll call you back. I'll call you back as soon as i can.",
        "Harley: Fine. I have to check on reva anyway.",
        "Reva: You're still here.",
        "Josh: I told you I'm going to stay here as long as you're here.",
        "Reva: But you will go home and you will get some sleep tonight.",
        "Josh: No, I'm going to stay here.",
        "Reva: Yes, joshua.",
        "Josh: I'm going to sleep right here, reva.",
        "Reva: Nothing is going to happen to me.",
        "Josh: Carrie is out there. And if you think about, she's and if you think about it, she's got even more of a reason to come after you now, now that you know that she's the one that really killed maryanne.",
        "Reva: I'll be fine. You should be with marah. She shouldn't be alone right now.",
        "Josh: That's all taken care of. Billy and shayne are with her right now. I'm staying here. I'm sleeping here tonight.",
        "Reva: Okay. But you have to do something for me.",
        "Josh: Maybe.",
        "Reva: You need to go and stretch your legs and get something to eat so that I can get some sleep. You're driving me crazy.",
        "Josh: I'm not hungry.",
        "Reva: You eat, I'll doze and then you could come back in here and stare at me all you want. Deal?",
        "Josh: Okay. You got a deal.",
        "Reva: Good night.",
        "Josh: (Laughs)",
        "Jeffrey: That's right, it went down like clockwork. Okay, good. Got it. Hey, ross. How's it going? Well, you know, it's an interesting world we live in, isn't it?",
        "Ross: Is that your way of expressing political condolences?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, I'm sorry. You know, I just... it seemed like you had it all wrapped up. Then there was that last minute sudden burst of votes from fifth street. That's kind of weird. I might check into that if i were you.",
        "Ross: Believe me, I will.",
        "Edmund: Now is not the time for me to make that trip. I will let you know as soon as... soon as I can. Okay, thanks for calling.",
        "Cassie: Are you going somewhere?",
        "Edmund: No. Not without you. (Cheers and applause)",
        "Danny: Yes. Thank you. If everyone can just... wow, this is crazy. Very exciting. But if everyone can just settle down for one second. (Laughter) I want to say a few things.",
        "Bill: It's called a victory speech, danny.",
        "Danny: We hope. We don't want to get too much ahead of ourselves, but yes, according to the latest exit polls, thing are looking pretty good for us. ( Cheers and applause) if things do go as we hope, then it's because of all of you. And I need to say that and i want to thank you and I have a bunch of people I want to thank. I have to first thank this beautiful, amazing, woman to my left, my wife, michelle. (Applause) and, of course, the best, greatest campaign manager that any candidate could ever hope for, bill lewis. (Applause) my business partner and great5 friend, cassie winslow who is also your host tonight. (Applause) and my cousin, tony, I love you, and all of you, I don't know what to say. I've made a lot of promises to everyone these past few months, and if I do become mayor...",
        "Bill: When ... when you become mayor, danny. (Cheers and applause)",
        "Danny: You can't resist loving this guy. You gotta love this him. (Laughter) when I become mayor, then I'm going to fulfill all of my promises for everyone and I'll do my very best for this town. That is my word, my promise. And now I'm sick of hearing myself talk, so I want to thank each and every one of you personally. So let's party! (Cheers and applause)",
        "Eden: You did it.",
        "Bill: I did, didn't I? Damn good.",
        "Eden: Looks, like I might have to start planning an inauguration.",
        "Bill: Not to mention, a wedding.",
        "Michelle: This is unbelievable.",
        "Danny: This is so great because we can appreciate it after everything we've been through. We know how good it is. I don't even... I'm overwhelmed. I don't know who to even thank first.",
        "Cassie: You can thank me.",
        "Danny: Come here, you. Come here. You have saved my life more than once. You're the best.",
        "Cassie: I think you are. I'm so happy for you.",
        "Danny: No, you are.",
        "Tony: Hey, how are you doing? Can I have a minute alone, please. Thank you. Listen, I called father ray. He's on his way down. We are proud of you, man. You did it. Incredible. Good man. All right?",
        "Danny: I want some champagne.",
        "Tony: You want some?",
        "Tony: Please.",
        "Jeffrey: Mr. Mayor.",
        "Danny: Mr. D.A.. now that you have. We need to talk. We'll do breakfast next week.",
        "Jeffrey: Danny, danny. We need to talk now.",
        "Danny: I can'T...",
        "Jeffrey: This is a conversation you cannot afford to miss.",
        "Danny: I'll bet you a million dollars I know what this is about.",
        "Jeffrey: No, I don't think you do.",
        "Danny: Yeah, I do. Late voters on fifth street. Put me over the top. Ross wants a recount, right? He's probably going to throw in allegations of tampering. Fine. Give him his recount. I welcome it. I want to you prove that my win was clean.",
        "Jeffrey: Danny, why don't you sit down.",
        "Danny: No, I don't have time. I have to get back downstairs to my people. Do whatever you have to do. Don't worry built. It's fine.",
        "Jeffrey: No, really. Danny, this isn't about recount or determining who won the vote. Sit down, please.",
        "Danny: I'll stand.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay. Danny, I have been working on a very complicated case for a very long time, and the puzzle pieces are finally coming into place. There's still one missing, and that's where you come in. You see, you're the only person that can help me.",
        "Danny: Okay.",
        "Jeffrey: Do you remember when we had a little discussion about delirium and how it related to the turf war with vinnie salerno and angelo bruzzi.",
        "Danny: I'm just as concerned as you are about drug proliferation. And soon as I'm sworn in, we'll create a task force.",
        "Jeffrey: Listen to me, will you, please. We are not going to create a task force.",
        "Danny: I've got to get back downstairs.",
        "Jeffrey: Will you listen to me, please? Thank you. There's someone at spaulding enterprises that is willingly selling antimonius which is what delirium is derived from, to the wrong people. We're convinced that spaulding is in bed with the mob.",
        "Danny: Spaulding? You're kidding.",
        "Jeffrey: No.",
        "Danny: Wow. So, what do you want to do? Do you want to start an investigation?",
        "Jeffrey: No, we've already started the investigation, danny. Spaulding is covered. You see, we need someone on the other side now. Someone with ties to organized crime.",
        "Danny: Yeah. Me? (Laughs) that was good. That was good. You really... you almost had me.",
        "Jeffrey: Danny, danny, I'm not joking, danny. It's not a joke. I want you to go back into the mob and work for me undercover.",
        "Danny: Work for you on a drug sting operation.",
        "Jeffrey: That's exactly right.",
        "Danny: Really? Now give me one good reason why the hell I would ever want to do that?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, that's simple. You don't have a choice.",
        "Marina: I hope my keys are in",
        "Marina: I hope my keys are$in there even though you're not supposed to count on me to have the keys.",
        "Sandy: I love these domestic disputes.",
        "Drug dealer: How's it going?",
        "Sandy: What's up? Can we help you with something?",
        "Drug dealer: I'm thinking maybe I can help you. I'm talking D. Pure.",
        "Shayne: No thanks. And, you may want to take a walk.",
        "Drug dealer: How about you, pretty lady? You look like you could use a lift.",
        "Sandy: Go, now, while you can walk.",
        "Marina: Let's just get inside.",
        "Gus: Thank you, kids. You helped me keep my cover.",
        "Reva: (Gasping)",
        "Edmund: Cassie winslow, you look absolutely radiant.",
        "Cassie: I'm excited. It is such a big night.",
        "Edmund: For you as well as danny. I hope he appreciates the fact that he wouldn't be here tonight without you.",
        "Cassie: That's not true.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, you trusted him when no one else would. You dove into the fifth street project, co-sign the loan. He has a very good friend in you.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, he does. Some people in this town thought I was nuts to back him. He has lived up to every single one of my expectations. He has never let me down and i don't think he ever will.",
        "Edmund: Sometimes all it takes is the trust of one person.",
        "Cassie: Wel,l then here's to finding that one person.",
        "Edmund: You know what? I think I already have.",
        "Bill: I want to thank you for all your help.",
        "Tony: Bill. Excuse me, have you seen danny?",
        "Bill: He left with o'neill.",
        "Tony: Just now?",
        "Bill: Yeah.",
        "Tony: Damn it, I knew it.",
        "Bill: Knew what?",
        "Tony: I think ross is going to contest this election. Why else would o'neill need to see him right now? Tell me.",
        "Bill: On what grounds? Bad count.",
        "Tony: Or fraud involved.",
        "Bill: Hey, come on. That's ridiculous.",
        "Tony: I'm telling you what i think, all right?",
        "Eden: Maybe tony heard wrong. Let's not think about it until we know more, okay?",
        "Bill: You're right. Danny is going to win and when he does, we are going to tell everyone that I'm the winner because you agreed to be my wife.",
        "Eden: Oh.",
        "Edmund: Michelle bauers santos, I think you'll make a great first lady.",
        "Michelle: Thank you, edmund. You think if I ever get stuck, i can get some pointers from cassie. (Laughter)",
        "Cassie: And danny can get help from edmund.",
        "Michelle: That's right.",
        "Cassie: He may not need any. He seems to always have this instinct for knowing what to do in any situation.",
        "Michelle: My husband is so fast on his feet. He seems to have disappeared.",
        "Cassie: Maybe he went tout get some air. I'm so happy for you, I am. I got to tell you, partnering up with your husband was the best investment I ever made. I mean who knew when danny and i started the fifth street project it would lead to this moment?",
        "Danny: No, no, no. This is a joke, right? It has to be. You're joking. Right?",
        "Jeffrey: Danny, I'm a fed. But you knew that, right? And we don't joke about things like this.",
        "Danny: Then you're out of your mind. Do you realize how long it's taken me to wipe filth off of my reputation? I'm a legitimate businessman now. I built fifth street up out of nothing. I just got elected mayor tonight, jeffrey. No, no. What makes you think that after everything I've been through, everything I've worked so hard for, I would entertain what you're suggesting to me for even one second?",
        "Jeffrey: Maybe because you're not as clean as you say you are.",
        "Danny: Prove it.",
        "Jeffrey: You funded the fifth street project with dirty money, danny.",
        "Danny: That'S...",
        "Jeffrey: That's what? That's the truth, isn't it? You supposedly went clean.",
        "Danny: I did go clean.",
        "Jeffrey: You made aeal, danny, with vinnie salerno. You said he could have the rackets here in springfield, but you didn't give him everything. You kept a little toe hold for yourself and your future aspirations. I got surveillance photos. I got phone calls. I$got inside information from government sources, danny. I got enough to put you away right now for a very long time.",
        "Danny: Try it.",
        "Jeffrey: You want me to try it? That what you really want?",
        "Danny: Try it.",
        "Jeffrey: That's what you really want?",
        "Danny: Yeah. I'm serious. Try it.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay. You're going down. But you're not going to go down alone.",
        "Danny: Really?",
        "Jeffrey: That would be too easy. Because if you go down, you're going to take a bunch of people with you.",
        "Danny: Like?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, let's see. Let's start with cassie winslow.",
        "Danny: Where do you get this stuff? Who do you think you are? Cassie doesn't have anything to do with anything.",
        "Jeffrey: Cassie co-signed on a federal loan for the money for the fifth street project.",
        "Danny: So what? So what?",
        "Jeffrey: So what?",
        "Danny: Even if what you're accusing me of were true, which it isn't, cassie put her name on a piece of paper.",
        "Jeffrey: That makes her your partner, your accomplice in the eyes of the law. Doesn't matter what she knew or didn't know. Ignorance is not a legal defense. If you want to go down, cassie is going to go down. I can get her on racketeering. I can get her on a number of things. By the time she gets out of prison, her kids are going to be grown up.",
        "Danny: You're unbelievable.",
        "Jeffrey: Is that how you want to repay the woman, the only woman who believed in you here in this town?Q so there's one way, there's only one way you can save her and save yourself. You're going to do exactly what I tell to you do.",
        "Sandy: Are you okay?",
        "Marina: Yeah. I guess that guy kind of spooked me.",
        "Sandy: A little too much craziness lately, huh?",
        "Marina: Yeah. I don't feel brave like i usually do.",
        "Sandy: That's okay. Good old spunky marina will come back.",
        "Marina: Whoever she was.",
        "Sandy: Hey, if I can help. Let me know. I know what it's like.",
        "Gus: Hey everybody, what's going on? A late night party.",
        "Gus: Don't make me call your aunt harley because that's what I'll do. I promise.",
        "Marina: No party. I promise.",
        "Gus: Did you see a slimy looking guy out there?",
        "Gus: No, why?",
        "Shayne: Because some guy practically accosted us right there trying to sell us some kind of drug.",
        "Gus: Really? What kind of drug D.",
        "Sandy: D. He was a little too brave for my taste. He scared marina.",
        "Gus: Are you all right?",
        "Marina: It scares me that we come here every night to work and this could happen again. Only who knows.",
        "Gus: I'll see what can I do to make sure it doesn't happen again. So none of you guys have seen him before? He's not like a regular around here.",
        "Shayne: If I had seen this guy before, I would have remembered him.",
        "Gus: Glad to hear it. You know you can talk to me if you want to. I'm good like that.",
        "Sandy: Are you asking if we know him personally? Do we do drugs?",
        "Marina: No. How could you even ask that?",
        "Gus: Well, I ask the question because it's becoming an epidemic. There are a lot of nice kids getting hooked on drugs.",
        "Shayne: These nice kids don't do drugs.",
        "Sandy: No interest and no money.",
        "Gus: Good, because I don't want to have to kick any butt. It's been a long day and I'm tired. You guys hanging out for a while?",
        "Marina: A few minutes.",
        "Gus: Make sure you go home together and get home in one piece. And if you see this sleaze bag again, call me. (Reva gasping)",
        "Josh: Get away from her!",
        "Reva: Joshua, don't!",
        "Josh: You stay away from her. Do you hear me?",
        "Carrie: Why don't you kill me the way you killed maryanne?",
        "Josh: I did not kill maryanne. You did!",
        "Carrie: I would never hurt maryanne. I was saving her from pain, but you will not in hell for what you did! You desecrated her grave. You dragged her out of the earth you violated her memory. First you killed her and first you killed her and then...",
        "Harley: You killed her! You killed maryanne. She didn't die in that car crash. She was alive and she swam to shore and you strangled her to death.",
        "Carrie: I would never hurt her. I would never hurt maryanne. I was trying to save her. It was them. It was them. They killed her.",
        "Harley: No.",
        "Carrie: They killed her with their indifference.",
        "Harley: No. Carrie, it was a crushed wind pipe that killed her. She was choked to death by you.",
        "Frank: Thanks for the call. Caroline carruthers, you have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You are under arrest for the murder of maryanne carruthers.",
        "Harley: And the attempted murder of reva shayne lewis.",
        "Frank: You have a right to an attorney. If you cannot afford one, one will be appointed to you. Do you understand these rights as I've said them to you?",
        "Josh: Are you okay?",
        "Reva: Yeah. Thank you for saving my life, bud.",
        "Josh: Thank you for saving mine.",
        "Gus: The drugs are definitely out there, right in our own backyard. Drugs. Spaulding. Salerno. Damn. What is the connection?",
        "Bill: What a night.",
        "Eden: It's so great to see people so happy.",
        "Bill: As long as I get to see you happy.",
        "Cassie: You know what? I think this has to be one of the most incredible nights. I think everything is going to work out for everyone. I do.",
        "Michelle: Where are you, danny? You're missing your own party.",
        "Tony: Some party, huh? Big night.",
        "Michelle: Yep.",
        "Tony: I'm proud of him. And you, of course.",
        "Michelle: He did it all.",
        "Tony: Well, yeah, maybe. But he could not have done it without you. And you've got a great life, now a great future, especially with you in it. Something I'd like to know a little bit about.",
        "Danny: Who do you work for, jeffrey?",
        "Jeffrey: I work for justice.",
        "Danny: Justice? Really? That's very interesting. Then why don't you actually go after people who are hurting other people. Like these major corporations. Look at the lives they destroy every day. They just yank the money out of our pockets. Do you go after them? No, you go after people like me.",
        "Jeffrey: You committed a crime.",
        "Danny: All right. Okay. Yeah, all right. I used some tainted money to fund the project that built decent, new homes for hundreds of people. I brought these people jobs. I gave them a future. Did I do it with money that came from drugs like d? No, I did not. It came from sanitation. It came from construction. Maybe a few people were squeezed. No one was hurt. No one. That's besides the point. I'm clean now.",
        "Jeffrey: You're clean?",
        "Danny: Yeah, I'm clean.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, okay. Oh, look. That's you that's you and vinnie salerno at the bella villa restaurant in new york city having a sit-down. Wonder what you guys were talking about. Oh, and here's another one of you and mr. Bruzzi outside the valentines dan in the limousine. This is a list of the people that you put on the payroll at lewis construction, which incidentally reminds me that means that bill and josh will go down for this as well. I got more. I got so much here, dan, I don't know what to do with it.",
        "Danny: So you have been watching me for years. Why did you wait until now to do this?",
        "Jeffrey: You weren't properly placed yet.",
        "Danny: You needed time to set me up. That's what you've been doing. All along, isn't it? You wanted me to run for mayor. Backed me, and then you gave me a heads up about bruzzi's guy not on payroll but because you weren't ready to bring me down yet. You wanted me to climb as high as I could, so I'd have everything to lose. You've been planning this since the day you waltzed into town. You son of a bitch.",
        "Danny: Next on \"guiding light\"...",
        "Bill: I have a little announcement to make. One that makes me a very happy man.",
        "Jeffrey: Listen to me, danny, you walk out that door, you are never going to get a chance like this again. This is your last chance at redemption.",
        "Marah: I can't believe this. After all this time, all these months and years.",
        "Josh: It's over, marah. You're free."
