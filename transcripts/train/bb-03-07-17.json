        "Ridge is watching RJ say bye to Coco. When RJ is not looking where he is backing up, a forklift heads right to him. Coco calls his name and dives at him to get him out of harm's way. Ridge and Brooke are both grateful that Coco was there at the right time. Saul shows Sally the tiny bug she is to give Coco. They decide on a necklace that he can hide it in and no one will ever know. RJ tells his parents that Coco is a good person despite her last name. RJ begs again to just give her a chance and Ridge gives in and says she can stay for now. She thanks him and retorts that he will not regret this. Brooke thanks Ridge for doing this and he says it is his one good deed of the year.",
        "Saul is interested in learning about Sally's parents since he only knows her grandmother, Shirley. She's not proud of it but says her parents were con artists that worked and traveled with the carnivals. They would do anything for money. And Coco seems the only one to have escaped that wrath. But for Sally all of this toughened her up. Coco thanks RJ for going to bat for her with his dad. He says from the first time he met her he felt like he was supposed to and now she has saved his life. He's like an awkward school boy but he leans in and kisses her. Ridge tells Brooke that he has a strange feeling about that girl. She may look innocent but she is a Spectra. Saul hands Sally the finished necklace and says anything Coco sees, they will see it all too. It's the only insurance they have."

        "Coco: Your father has every right to be cautious, especially when it comes to my sister and grandma. I should go. Goodbye, R.J.",
        "R.J.: Goodbye.",
        "Coco: R.J.!",
        "Saul: Coco will be fine.",
        "Sally: She was adamant. She will not spy on Forrester.",
        "Saul: Well, that's where we get creative.",
        "Sally: You're talking about planting a spying device on my sister.",
        "Saul: Oh, no, that was Shirley's idea. I just bought the camera.",
        "Sally: All right. Look, I said that it might work. I didn't say I was okay with it.",
        "Saul: Well, neither am I, but what other choice do we have? That loan shark is breathing down our necks, that developer wants to come in here and demolish this entire building! And you made a promise to your aunt sally, right?",
        "Sally: I know, I know. I know, okay? Coco's our only hope.",
        "Saul: Yeah, she's all we got, so let's just give it a shot, sally, 'cause at this point, we got nothing to lose.",
        "Sally: Except for our integrity.",
        "Saul: Hey, what does your grandma say about that?",
        "Sally: \"Integrity doesn't pay the bills.\"",
        "Saul: Yeah, and she's right.",
        "Sally: Stealing from Forrester... making cheap knock-offs... okay, yes, it worked for my namesake. It built us this brick-and-mortar... all right. Let me see what you've got.",
        "Saul: Yeah?",
        "Sally: That's it?",
        "Saul: Yep.",
        "Sally: It's tiny.",
        "Saul: Almost imperceptible. But it can record for hours. And best of all, we can sit here and watch it all live. Careful.",
        "Sally: And it just as good as being there ourselves?",
        "Saul: Exactly.",
        "Sally: We are gonna have to put this thing on coco without her knowing.",
        "Saul: Oh, I already got that figured out.",
        "Sally: Oh. Well, great. Let's hear it.",
        "Saul: Okay, so we put the camera on a pair of glasses.",
        "Sally: Coco doesn't wear glasses.",
        "Saul: No, she wears sunglasses all the time.",
        "Sally: Inside?",
        "Saul: Yeah, yeah, I've seen her do it.",
        "Sally: At her internship, coco is going to wear her sunglasses inside all day long? No. Not happening.",
        "Saul: Okay. All right. Plan B. What about a broach?",
        "Sally: A what?",
        "Saul: A broach! See, like a little fancy pin.",
        "Sally: It is not the 1930s. Teenagers don't wear broaches.",
        "Saul: Yeah. I know.",
        "Sally: Ooh. What about this? I was gonna use it in the collection and coco commented how much she likes it.",
        "Saul: Yeah, we can install the camera inside that necklace.",
        "Sally: You could do that?",
        "Saul: Uh, yeah, did you forget who you're talking to? Yeah. In fact, I could do it right now.",
        "Sally: It's good. It could work.",
        "Ridge: Just put some pressure on it.",
        "Coco: Okay.",
        "Ridge: There you go. Now, you're sure you didn't get knocked out?",
        "Coco: No, no, no, I didn't hit my head on anything. I think I just scraped it on something.",
        "Ridge: Okay, good. What about you?",
        "R.J.: I'm fine.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Brooke: Oh, my God! R.J.! Are you okay?",
        "R.J.: I'm okay. I'm okay.",
        "Brooke: Are you sure?",
        "R.J.: Yeah.",
        "Brooke: They told me that you fell, that there was some kind of accident.",
        "Ridge: Well, there was a forklift that lost control, and he was right in its path, but... well, coco pushed him out of the way just in time.",
        "Sally: You know what, I think I'm gonna give coco these earrings, too. I mean, I know the camera won't fit inside of them, but I think they'll go with the pendant. I mean, they are a pair, so... Saul... Saul... Saul... hello! Are you even listening to me?",
        "Saul: Um...yeah. No, I -- that's -- the earrings. That's a good idea.",
        "Sally: Maybe you should have another cup of coffee.",
        "Saul: I already -- I had four cups today. I'm very focused.",
        "Sally: You know, I posted this photo like two hours ago, and I only have 40 likes.",
        "Saul: Hey, what if we did a throwback photo of, uh, my grandpa and your aunt sally? I found some pictures when I was clearing out those boxes earlier.",
        "Sally: Oh, how cute!",
        "Saul: You know, I, um... I heard that, uh... my grandpa had a thing for your aunt sally. Yeah, I heard that he -- he even proposed to her.",
        "Sally: No way!",
        "Saul: Yeah, that's just what I heard.",
        "Sally: Old Saul proposed to aunt sally?",
        "Saul: Uh-huh.",
        "Sally: Oh, my God, I wonder what that was like. [Sighs]",
        "Saul: You really do care about me.",
        "Sally: Of course I care about you. You're my oldest and dearest friend.",
        "Saul: Sally, I want you to be my wife. I want you to take and wear this ring as my betrothed.",
        "Saul: Well, if your aunt sally is anything like you, I, uh -- I understand why my grandfather wanted to marry her.",
        "Sally: Aww, Saul, that was really sweet of you to say. What?",
        "Saul: Um, can I, uh... can I ask you a question, sally?",
        "Sally: Depends on what it is.",
        "Saul: Okay, um... you -- you said that you were raised by Shirley, your grandmother, but... where are your mom and dad?",
        "Sally: Well, um... grandma Shirley and aunt sally are sisters, obviously, and, uh... aunt sally was always really sweet to me and coco when we were young. Grandma took care of us. She did the best she could.",
        "Saul: You -- you didn't answer the question.",
        "Sally: Why are you so curious about my parents?",
        "Saul: Well, no one ever talks about them.",
        "Sally: Yeah, well, they weren't around when we got older.",
        "Saul: Why?",
        "Sally: It's complicated. In a way. And at the same time... it's really simple.",
        "Saul: Yeah? How so?",
        "Sally: What's my last name?",
        "Saul: Spectra.",
        "Sally: And what follows Spectras around? Trouble. No matter where we go, it follows us, we follow it.",
        "Saul: And it found your parents.",
        "Sally: Yeah, and, uh, poor coco, she's been... spending her entire life trying to run away from that trouble.",
        "Brooke: We'll never been able to thank you enough for saving our son. Right, ridge?",
        "Ridge: Yeah. Right. You did a very brave thing today.",
        "R.J.: See, dad, this shows she's not a threat! Who cares if her name is spectra? She's a good person. You said it yourself. She saved my life.",
        "Ridge: All right, R.J. I shouldn't have judged you just by your last name. You seem like a nice kid. You're bright and courageous, and what you did today, I mean, who doesn't that for someone that they barely know? Brooke and I are very grateful. But there's a lot of history between your family and my family, none of it good. I'm sorry, coco. You can't work here.",
        "R.J.: What? Dad! I would be dead right now if it wasn't for her.",
        "Ridge: It's settled, R.J.",
        "Brooke: Ridge, come on. Just hear him out.",
        "R.J.: Listen. I get it. You outrank me. You're C.E.O. But I'm not gonna let her get fired just because she has a last name you don't like. Let coco and me drive Spectras and Forresters in a new direction, finally have peace between our families. Just give her a chance.",
        "Brooke: You really should give her a chance to prove herself.",
        "Ridge: All right. You can stay, for now.",
        "Coco: Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Forrester. You won't -- you will not regret this, I promise.",
        "Ridge: I'm counting on it.",
        "Coco: Thank you.",
        "Ridge: That was a close call.",
        "Brooke: I know, R.J. Could have seriously been hurt!",
        "Ridge: Could have been a lot worse, yes.",
        "Brooke: If coco wasn't there, I don't even want to think what could have happened. She risked her life to save his. That is huge. Thank you, ridge. Thank you for letting her stay.",
        "Ridge: It's my good deed for the year.",
        "Brooke: [Giggles] I appreciate it, and I'm sure R.J. Does, too.",
        "Ridge: I just don't like the idea of having a spectra around here. Seem kind of boring.",
        "Sally: I would give anything for a simple life in the valley. My parents were carnies.",
        "Saul: Stop. No. No, they were not.",
        "Sally: Yep. Yeah, they were. They were in the carnival circuit all over California and Nevada. You name it, we were there.",
        "Saul: So -- so you and coco, you went with?",
        "Sally: Yeah. Yeah, we traveled all the time when I was young.",
        "Saul: [Scoffs]",
        "Sally: But coco was obviously still a baby. And then my, uh, parents, they did some sketchy stuff on the side.",
        "Saul: Like what?",
        "Sally: Ran some scams. Rigged some games -- card games. They were always dealing cards. And, uh... that's not the only thing they were dealing.",
        "Saul: Wow.",
        "Sally: They would do anything to make some extra money. That's just how Spectras are. You know how grams always says that Spectras are survivors?",
        "Saul: Mm-hmm.",
        "Sally: Yeah, we're more like swindlers. We come from a long line of very talented con artists.",
        "Saul: I just had no clue that it was that crazy.",
        "Sally: Well, eventually, my parents were unable to care for me and coco.",
        "Saul: So that's when you moved in with Shirley?",
        "Sally: Yeah, I mean, if it wasn't for grams, we would have been thrown into the system.",
        "Saul: Wow, thank goodness for Shirley, huh?",
        "Sally: Yeah, I mean, she tried to give us a really good life. She worked hard at the bakery, she scratched and clawed for every buck. Yeah, and now here we are, turning this place into a knock-off shop.",
        "Saul: Well, there's nothing wrong with that.",
        "Sally: We come from generations of hustlers, years and years of scammers, and then out pops coco. She's like this angel baby, the most innocent little girl that you have ever met in your life. And thinking of taking advantage of her... I don't know. I don't know. Maybe this is her fate. Maybe she is destined to become one of us.",
        "Coco: I've been fantasizing about this for years -- working at Forrester creations, prestigious fashion house to the stars, with fabulous people and gorgeous gowns... but I couldn't have predicted a near-death experience.",
        "[Both chuckle]",
        "R.J.: Extra bonus.",
        "Coco: True. You're right. It did make my first day very exciting.",
        "R.J.: That's Forrester for you -- never a dull moment.",
        "Coco: I'm glad you're okay.",
        "R.J.: I'm glad you're okay.",
        "Coco: I think I've stopped shaking.",
        "R.J.: [Laughs] Me, too.",
        "Coco: With as wild as today has been, there's really no place I'd rather be.",
        "R.J.: We're lucky to have you.",
        "Coco: You went to bat for me with your dad.",
        "R.J.: Well, if there was any doubts about you then... I don't think there are now.",
        "Coco: Thank you. For helping me keep my job. Standing up for me.",
        "R.J.: No, no. Thank you. For standing up that forklift.",
        "Saul: You guys had it so rough as kids, and I'm just -- I'm so sorry for all that your parents put you through.",
        "Sally: I'm okay. If anything, it toughened me up. But coco, she's -- she's definitely more vulnerable. She's always had a hard time trusting anyone. Probably because my mom and dad weren't around for most of her life. As fun- loving as she is on the outside, she can be guarded. And protective. Especially around guys.",
        "Coco: I'm just grateful your dad changed his mind.",
        "R.J.: Why wouldn't he? After what you did for me...",
        "Coco: This is a huge opportunity, R.J. I'll make you and your dad proud.",
        "R.J.: [Chuckles]",
        "Coco: What?",
        "R.J.: Okay, okay, this is gonna sound weird. But since I first saw you, I... I had this feeling. Like I was supposed to meet you. And now you've saved my life. Which I did not see coming.",
        "Coco: I didn't save your life.",
        "R.J.: Yeah. Yeah, you did.",
        "Coco: Well, anyone would have done exactly the same thing.",
        "R.J.: No. Not everyone's you. I think you're gonna do great things here.",
        "Coco: I'm just happy that I get to stay.",
        "R.J.: I mean, I -- [Laughs] I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Just --",
        "Coco: What?",
        "R.J.: I'm not usually like this.",
        "Coco: [Laughing] Like what? What are you talking about? Okay, look, whatever you have to say, it's okay. You can just say it.",
        "Ridge: I have a strange feeling about that girl.",
        "Brooke: I understand your hesitation. Really, I do. But I'm good with people. I like coco. I think she's a good girl. So just cut her some slack, okay? Sometimes you can be too suspicious of people.",
        "Ridge: I always have a reason. And I don't care how innocent she seems... she's a spectra.",
        "Brooke: [Scoffs] Oh, ridge.",
        "Sally: Where?",
        "Saul: Right inside there.",
        "Sally: Wow. That's pretty ingenious, Saul.",
        "Saul: I told you I could do it.",
        "Sally: So, how do we know it'll work?",
        "Saul: Okay, so, anything coco sees, we see. Every fabric, every design... we get to see it all.",
        "Sally: So, if we do this... it means that I am deceiving my sister, basically lying to her face.",
        "Saul: Look, sometimes when you start a business and things get a little desperate, you do what you got to do.",
        "Sally: By exploiting coco to rip off the Forresters? [Sighs] Can I really live with that?",
        "Saul: Sally... it's the only chance we got."
