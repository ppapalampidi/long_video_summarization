        "Ridge tells Deacon and Katie that it was Bill. Justin was flying the chopper and Bill gave him the orders to kill him. He's going to put him behind bars. Brooke asks Bill when they are leaving for Catalina. He says he is taking the helicopter over there now, make the arrangements and will come back and get her. He wants to get married today with no interferences and no surprises. Justin calls and Bill speaks with both he and Alison. He tells Justin to get over to the hanger and make sure all is ready when he hits the tarmac. Wyatt is at his desk and he pulls the box with the blue diamond out of his messenger bag. He quickly tucks it back inside when Hope and Liam come in. They welcome him back on his first day back at work. He asks Liam if he is offering him good luck. Liam says he has his support. Hope says he might be a little nervous since he now is basically alone. He pats the bag and says technically he is not alone. She asks if Quinn knows he is back. Wyatt says no. He just wants her to focus on getting better. They get around to work and he says he can't wait as there is a lot he things he can do with a talent like Ivy's. At that moment she comes in and hears this and is flattered that he likes her work. He says he has done a little research here and there. She says the same and she is sorry to hear his mother is no longer here. She hopes she will be back soon but until then she is extremely grateful for Wyatt's help with her line. Hope tells her that she is used to designing to just sell perhaps in one boutique but now her line could be seen worldwide. Wyatt says he has the facilities ad the people that can run things smoothly and he will be handling that end of things. Alison calls Deacon and says she found an opening in her schedule if he'd like to get together. He suggests the sooner the better but she needs to wait a bit and tells him her boss is getting married today. He's on the way now to the hanger to get the helicopter. Deacon tells Ridge that Brooke and Bill are getting married today. Bill is out of the house so this is his opportunity to go tell Brooke what Bill has done. Ridge says he has a better idea. He's going to the scene of the crime. Deacon shows up at Brooke's and asks if she can't put a smile on her face when she sees him. He asks if she has plans. She says she is just very busy. He says he will just cut to the chase. Whatever she is thinking about him, she is wrong. He doesn't want her to have any regrets. But she will if she doesn't get Spencer out of her life. She says she is in a hurry and she is not going to stand here and discuss this with him. He stops her from closing the door and says she is wrong about Bill too.",
        "Liam hobbles back to the office just as Bill is about to leave. He says he has been to Forrester's and Alison had told him that Bill wouldn't be in today. Bill says he's not. He is getting ready to go to Catalina. He and Brooke are getting married today. Liam is delighted and gives his old man a big hug. Bill tells him to keep this to himself; he wants it to just be him and Brooke. Ridge goes to the hanger and sees Justin as he gets out the SP jacket to put on. He turns around and Ridge sucker punches him in the face and Justin falls on the floor, out cold. Hope tells Wyatt looks like he and Ivy got off to a great start. He says yeah, he can get along with just about anybody under the right circumstances. She likes his work and he likes hers. Hope says good because she does not want there to be any awkwardness and especially between them. Wyatt says there is none. All he feels now is a big old sappy grateful attitude, big waves of it. He says he has been given a second chance and he's not going to waste another moment wishing it were different. He says he is just gonna appreciate everything around him. She wishes him good luck. When she leaves he takes the diamond out of the bag again and says he has all the luck he needs right here. Deacon tells Brooke that Bill is trying to make it look like Ridge is crazy but he is not. Brooke says Ridge is confused. He had a horrific accident but Bill was not responsible and nobody is going to prove otherwise. Bill climbs aboard the helicopter and slaps Justin on the shoulder and says take him away. Its taken a while to get here but now Forrester can't stop them. He's always in the driver's seat and Forrester was no match for him. As they take off, we see the pilot's face and it is Ridge."

        "Wyatt: At least let me give you the credit for the second chance here at Forrester.",
        "Liam: Are you kidding me right now? After what you did for me, I wouldn't dare. You -- you earned this.",

        "Ivy: I'm so flattered you're familiar with my work.",
        "Wyatt: Well, I've done a little research here and there.",
        "Ivy: Mm. Well, in that case, I won't have to tell you how much I admire your mother.",
        "Wyatt: Oh. II' I'm really sorry to hear that she's going through a difficult time at the moment.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Ivy: Yeah. Well, I hope she's designing again soon. But until then, I'm extremely grateful to have your help with my line.",
        "Wyatt: Hmm. [Chuckles]",
        "Brooke: I can help set up. Take me to Catalina with you.",
        "Bill: And spoil all my surprises?",
        "Brooke: I thought you said there were no more surprises.",
        "Bill: None for me.",
        "Brooke: Ah.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Bill: Mm. Sorry. Uh, Justin, Alison told you what's going on?",
        "Justin: She's right here. She says you're getting married today.",
        "Bill: We are. Put me on speaker. Alison, you got my text?",
        "Alison: The wedding planner and her team are on Catalina island now working away. It should be a go soon.",
        "Bill: Great. Uh, Justin, Rupert's helicopter is in my hangar. I want you to get over there and make sure that she is fueled up and ready to go.",
        "Justin: Copy that.",
        "Bill: We're flying to the island, checking things out, coming back to Santa Monica, and picking up my bride. So hang up with me, get in your car, get over there, and make sure that helicopter's ready to go the second I hit the tarmac. Go.",
        "Brooke: [Chuckles] If the ceremony's in a few hours, you're not giving everybody much time to prepare.",
        "Ridge: Bill really thought he was gonna get away with this.",
        "Deacon: If it wasn't for me, he might have.",
        "Ridge: What do you want -- a pat on the back, or you want to help get this guy?",
        "Katie: Okay, all right. Let's just hold on.",
        "Ridge: Sorry, Katie.",
        "Katie: No, this is horrifying, but he is still the father of my son.",
        "Ridge: His helicopter was in Abu Dhabi. Justin was flying it. He's lied to everybody, including Brooke. I'm gonna put him behind bars.",

        "Wyatt: Uh, total world domination, yeah.",
        "Ivy: You know what? You're either extremely confident in my ability or your own.",
        "Wyatt: Both, actually.",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles]",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Hope: All right, so you know that you're going to be working as a team.",
        "Wyatt: And I will be handling the manufacturing end of things.",
        "Ivy: Oh. Okay. It's just, I normally did all of that by myself back in Sydney.",
        "Wyatt: Right, my mom did, too, until it took away too much time from designing.",
        "Ivy: Oh.",
        "Hope: You're used to designing pieces that are sold in one boutique, but now you could be potentially designing jewelry that will be sold all over the world.",
        "Wyatt: Right, and my facility and my employees are the best, and we will do an excellent job at executing your designs.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, well, Quinn artisan does have a reputation for quality.",
        "Wyatt: Hmm.",
        "Hope: So does Forrester.",
        "Wyatt: Which is one of the many reasons why they make such a great combination.",
        "Hope: And why I am so excited to see what the two of you will accomplish together.",
        "Bill: All right, I'll be back soon.",
        "Brooke: You really won't let me do anything?",
        "Bill: Uh, yeah. You can plan every anniversary party we ever have -- all 100 of them. How's that?",
        "Brooke: If I go with you, I could save you a trip.",
        "Bill: Mm. Call your sisters. Have them help you get ready.",
        "Brooke: Ohh, I don't think Katie's gonna want to do that.",
        "Bill: Well, then she's as confused as Ridge is. This is a big day for us -- a cause for celebration. In a few hours, I'm going to be the luckiest man on the planet. I'll be back before you know it. Then you're gonna jump in that chopper with me, fly over to Catalina, and we're finally going to become husband and wife.",
        "Brooke: Finally.",
        "Bill: Finally.",
        "Deacon: Brooke's being lied to.",
        "Katie: If Bill was really responsible for all this...",
        "Ridge: He was.",
        "Deacon: Oh, come on. Of course, he was. There's no doubt about it.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Deacon: Hang on a second. This could be important. Hey. I was just thinking about you.",
        "Alison: I was thinking about you, too. Earlier, you mentioned getting together. Well, it looks like there's gonna be an opening in my schedule.",
        "Deacon: Great. I'll pick you up.",
        "Alison: Not now. Later this evening.",
        "Deacon: Won't your boss be needing you?",
        "Alison: He'd better not. He'll be with his new bride.",
        "Deacon: They're getting married today?",
        "Alison: It's insane. I probably have six people calling from Catalina right now. Everyone's in panic mode. Bill's on his way to the hangar, and he's choppering over to check on everything now.",
        "Deacon: Uh, so you better go and, you know, take care of all that.",
        "Alison: We can make plans later?",
        "Deacon: Yeah, big plans.",
        "Ridge: What's going on?",
        "Deacon: Bill and Brooke are getting married today.",
        "Katie: Where?",
        "Deacon: Catalina island. He's taking the helicopter over to make all the arrangements.",
        "Ridge: Helicopter?",
        "Deacon: Yeah.",
        "Ridge: When is he leaving?",
        "Deacon: Well, he's heading over to the hangar right now, so Brooke's getting ready while he flies over there to check everything out. Hey, listen to me. Hey. This is your chance. Go now and talk to Brooke and tell her what Bill did.",
        "Ridge: I have a better idea.",
        "Katie: Wait, wait. What are you gonna do? Where are you going?",
        "Ridge: Scene of the crime.",
        "Hope: So, for now, you can just work anywhere you can find a drafting table.",
        "Ivy: So, does Wyatt have an office?",
        "Hope: Uh, no.",
        "Ivy: Oh. Really? Because I thought he spent a lot of time here.",
        "Hope: He did. Uh, Quinn, too, but that's mostly for meetings. A lot of the work they do just goes on at their facility. He'll have to give you a tour.",
        "Ivy: Okay, but we'll be working here at Forrester?",
        "Hope: Yes.",
        "Ivy: Okay.",
        "Hope: Yes, you will.",
        "Ivy: And -- and that won't be weird for you? You know, Liam's your boyfriend, and Wyatt's his brother, and they obviously get along, but Wyatt's your ex. That's not gonna be an issue?",
        "Hope: You know, if anyone had trouble working with their exes at Forrester, nothing would get done around here. We all respect each other. That's the important thing. Relationships change, but on some level, we all still care about each other.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs]",
        "Deacon: Come on. I mean, you can't put a smile on and least say hello? Such a beautiful smile.",
        "Brooke: If you're looking for hope, she's at work.",
        "Deacon: Why aren't you?",
        "Brooke: I have other plans.",
        "Deacon: Anything interesting?",
        "Brooke: I'm just really very busy.",
        "Deacon: Big plans, huh? Look, Brooke, small talk was never our thing, right? So I'm just gonna cut to the chase.",
        "Brooke: Yes, please.",
        "Deacon: You're wrong about me. Whatever you were thinking when I walked in this door, whatever you're thinking now, you could regret it. I don't want that for you. I don't want you to have any regrets -- you know, things that you wish you could undo.",
        "Brooke: That's really very nice of you. But I think I'm okay.",
        "Deacon: Well, you will be once you get Bill Spencer out of your life.",
        "Brooke: Look, I-I'm not gonna have this conversation.",
        "Deacon: Listen to me, please.",
        "Brooke: Deacon, I'm in a hurry.",
        "Deacon: You're wrong about Bill, too.",
        "Bill: Well, well, well. Hopalong gracing us with his presence.",
        "Liam: Yeah.",
        "Bill: Where the hell have you been?",
        "Liam: I have been at Forrester. What are you, uh -- what are you doing here? Alison said you wouldn't be in today.",
        "Bill: Yeah, I-I'm not. I'm on my way to the hangar.",
        "Liam: Are you taking a trip?",
        "Bill: You might say that. Catalina island.",
        "Liam: Oh.",
        "Bill: Brooke and I are getting married.",
        "Liam: What? Now?",
        "Bill: Mm-hmm.",
        "Liam: Hope didn't say anything about this. You're actually getting married?!",
        "Bill: Shh! Shh! Shh!",
        "Liam: What?",
        "Bill: We're trying to keep this on the down-low, Liam.",
        "Liam: Okay, okay. So this is a secret?",
        "Bill: It's simple, private. In the vineyard.",
        "Liam: That's awesome. I'm so happy for you. Congratulations.",
        "Bill: Thanks. Thanks. Thanks. Okay, now, really, please, all right? Just keep it to yourself. I don't want anyone to know.",
        "Liam: Oh, what's the matter? You don't want your reporters reporting on your wedding?",
        "Bill: No. No, I don't. Just Brooke and me.",
        "Justin: [Sighs] Man. All fueled up and ready to go. Where are you, dollar Bill? Come on. [Grunts]",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Wyatt: Oh. Sorry. H.R. had a few dozen more papers for me to sign.",
        "Hope: Hey. You're officially back.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. Back and ready to go.",
        "Hope: Mm-hmm.",
        "Wyatt: Where's Ivy?",
        "Hope: Oh, she just stepped out for a minute.",
        "Wyatt: Oh. Well, then that doesn't give us much time, then... to talk about her.",
        "Hope: Yep. Right. Yeah. Uh, yeah. You guys seem to have really hit it off.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. I mean, I-I get along with anybody under the right circumstances.",
        "Hope: Mm. She really likes your work.",
        "Wyatt: And I like hers.",
        "Hope: Hey, I-I just want you to know that she doesn't know the details about your mom -- just that she's not designing for us anymore.",
        "Wyatt: Right. Thank you for that.",
        "Hope: Yeah.",
        "Wyatt: I know Ivy's family and all...",
        "Hope: Yeah, but she's also your co-worker, and I don't want there to be any awkwardness between you two. Or...between us.",
        "Wyatt: That's not how I'm feeling at all.",
        "Hope: No?",
        "Wyatt: Mnh-mnh. All I am feeling right now is gratitude -- great, big, sappy, disgustingly beautiful waves of it, okay?",
        "[Both laugh]",
        "Wyatt: This is the second chance that I've been praying for, hope, and I'm not gonna waste another moment wishing that it could be any different, okay?",
        "Hope: Okay.",
        "Wyatt: I'm just gonna appreciate everything around me.",
        "Hope: All right. Well, then I should let you get to it.",
        "Wyatt: Already started.",
        "Hope: Good luck.",
        "Wyatt: Thank you.",
        "Hope: Okay.",
        "[Both chuckle]",
        "Wyatt: [Sighs] I got all the luck I need right here.",
        "[Helicopter blades whirring]",
        "Deacon: Brooke, please, you don't want to marry Bill. Look, he's trying to make Ridge seem crazy. Well, guess what -- he's not.",
        "Brooke: Ridge is recovering from a serious head injury, post-traumatic stress. He's confused.",
        "Deacon: No, that's not true. All right? Look, the last thing that Bill wants is for Ridge to recover his memories.",
        "Brooke: I-I-I really don't want to talk about this. I am in a hurry.",
        "Deacon: Just hear me out.",
        "Brooke: No. What happened to Ridge was a horrific accident -- him falling out of that helicopter -- but Bill was not responsible for that...and nobody is going to prove otherwise.",
        "Bill: All right, Justin. Let's go, my man. Get us to Catalina. Check things out. Come back, get Brooke. It's taken us a long time to get here, but she's finally gonna be mine. And Forrester -- he can't stop us. Who does he think he's dealing with, anyway? I'm always in the driver's seat. He's no match for me.",
