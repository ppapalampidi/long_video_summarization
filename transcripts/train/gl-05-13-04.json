        "Gus: Yeah?",
        "Dealer: Yeah.",
        "Gus: How long might that take?",
        "Dealer: 20 minutes. You got the extra cash?",
        "Gus: Yeah, I got it right here.",
        "Dealer: 20 minutes.",

        "Alan: Forget about Hanover. Have you seen this?",
        "Olivia: Why are you reading that rag?",
        "Alan: For your information, I used to own that rag.",
        "Olivia: Maybe you should buy it back.",
        "Alan: Or bankrupt them. Jeanette, get me Sandra Sundel of the legal department in here.",
        "Olivia: What will you accomplish by suing them?",
        "Alan: Olivia, the feds are breathing down our neck. PR trash like this could do irreparable damage. It says that I bought Phillip's way out of the hospital.",
        "Olivia: Then you spin it. Just let me handle this. Please? False alarm, Jeanette. We don't need legal after all.",
        "Alan: Olivia, what are you...",
        "Olivia: Come on. Phillip was overwhelmed by everything that was going on in his life. He just needed a rest.",
        "Alan: Well, that could be a tough sell but I'll set up a meeting with the pr department.",
        "Olivia: And in the meantime, I think it's important that I stay on at Spaulding, on Phillip's behalf.",
        "Alan: For the good of the company, huh?",
        "Olivia: You and I both know that it's important for Spaulding to be perceived as a company with a steady hand at the helm.",

        "Michelle: Okay.",
        "Danny: Okay?",
        "Michelle: You going to be back in time to talk to Nico?",
        "Danny: (Sighs) Michelle, I will try to be back. I will. But don't you think maybe it would be better if I'm not the one who tells him?",
        "Michelle: Better for you or better for Nico?",
        "Danny: He's going to hate me. I really don't want to see the look on his face when he finds out. But Salerno knows that he's living with us. It makes him a target. We've got to get him away from us and we've got to do it now.",
        "Michelle: Danny, we told him we were going to give him a home and now we're going to close the door on him?",
        "Danny: I know. Michelle, we'll still be looking out for him. He just can't know about it.",
        "Michelle: You think he'll ever understand that some day when this is all out in the open?",
        "Danny: Nico is a tough kid.",
        "Michelle: Yeah, he may act tough but this is going to hurt him a lot.",
        "Danny: We're doing the right thing.",
        "Michelle: No, what you mean to say is we have no other choice.",
        "Danny: Yeah, no choice but to protect the people we care about. That's right. Hopefully some day Nico will understand. I've got to go. Bye.",

        "Alan: We think we need to do a little damage control.",
        "Phillip: I have already spoken to pr. I will do some interviews. I will get the truth out.",

        "Phillip: Really? Good.",
        "Alan: Yes, as a matter of fact...",
        "Phillip: It's not going to be a problem. We've dealt with similar issues in the past. I'll take care of it. The much bigger issue is what we're going to do about this run on the stock. That we have to put a stop to right now, which means we have to deal with these feds and get them the hell out of here, now.",
        "Alan: You're right, as always.",
        "Olivia: We also have to be mindful of how the stockholders perceive your return.",
        "Phillip: Honey, did you not hear what I just said?",
        "Alan: We think that we need to proceed cautiously with your transition back. It needs to be done slowly, Phillip.",
        "Olivia: There's no reason that you have to jump right back in.",
        "Phillip: But there's no reason for me not to. We can't react to this kind of garbage.",
        "Olivia: We can't not react to it, given the tentative nature of our stock.",
        "Alan: Just look at it as a preemptive strike.",
        "Phillip: Look at what as a preemptive strike? What are you trying to tell me?",
        "Olivia: Alan and I both agree that we have to deal with the consequences of this article, okay? We have to make it a moot point.",
        "Alan: Look, we're afraid that the spotlight might stress you out again.",
        "Olivia: And undo all the good that your treatment did.",

        "Shayne: Well, maybe they're upset that we're not going to be around to help out with the yard work.",
        "Sandy: Yeah, what's up with that, anyway? Can't they just hire a gardener?",
        "Marina: Hold your tongue. This is the Midwest. People take their lawn care very personally. My dad was doing yard work today, too. He hinted around for some help but I got out of it because it's my birthday week.",
        "Sandy: It's hard for me to believe that your birthday lasts a whole week.",
        "Shayne: Believe it. Believe it.",
        "Marina: It's my favorite holiday. And the grand finale is a big cooper all- you-can-eat. My favorite Greek foods. Baklava, sasinoski.",
