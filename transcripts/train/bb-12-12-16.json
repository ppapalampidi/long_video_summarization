    "Recap": [
        "Quinn stands over the bloodied body of Katie on the floor. Brooke tells Rick that it does not make any sense that Quinn handed the CEO job to Steffy. His dad does not ask anyone else; he only does what Quinn wants him to do. Neither can figure this out. Rick thinks the job should be his, of course. It must be some ploy of Quinn and they need to get Eric to re-consider. She's too much in control. Now she will be more dangerous than ever. Brooke says she will talk to Eric. Katie's voice awakens Quinn from her stance. Katie invites Quinn over to see her house. Quinn is distracted and is barely listening. Eric invites Brooke in and says Ridge told him the good news; this is something to celebrate. He assures her that while he and Ridge are not good right now, he wants him to be happy and she eases his tension and brings out his best nature. She mentions Steffy and why he would put her in charge as CEO. Rick has more qualifications and Eric passed him right up. They are both upset by this.",
        "Katie shows Quinn her house and again Quinn is distant and barely listening to her yammer on. Finally Quinn says she must reiterate that she is not insecure or jealous but she does not want Katie to be spending alone time with Eric. She saw them kiss. Katie scoffs that she is worried about a little kiss on the cheek. Quinn says she is always going after Eric to get him included in her life. She is not going to let Katie play on her husband's sympathy. Katie says this is no big deal. She and Eric have been friends for a long time. It was a friendly kiss, nothing more ..and it will not happen again. Quinn says good .and it's too bad that Katie is here all alone. Katie says that sounds a little bit like a threat. Nicole speaks with Rick and he lays it on her about Steffy being CEO. He thinks she needs to worry about Quinn. He's really worried as it is scary how much influence she has over Eric. Brooke says she does not agree with Eric's decision. He says this is not a punishment for Rick. Eric remembers the time that even he had to answer to Brooke. They will take care of any problems as they come up. He changes the subject by saying Katie is now living next door and he likes that. He's really proud of her starting a new life for her and her son. She is not looking back and he is surprised that she was not more upset when Brooke did not marry Bill. He admits Quinn is not an easy person to get along with. He would love if Quinn would become friends with Katie. And he assures her Katie will not be all alone as he expects to see a lot of her living next door. Katie tells Quinn the last thing she would want is to make Quinn insecure or be disrespectful and she never meant to hurt Quinn. Quinn says she had told Katie how much she admired her and yet the first thing she did was go over and try to get in Eric's life. Katie says this meant nothing and Quinn is so wrong. Quinn says she is only trying to protect Eric. His family has put him through the wringer and if it looks like she is over-reacting then just call her crazy as that is what all the others in the family call her. She is very grateful for the life she has now and the commitment she and Eric have and she is not going to jeopardize that. She hopes she made herself clear. Katie responds yes she has made herself perfectly clear."

        "Brooke: Why would she do that?",
        "Rick: If she's presented with the opportunity, she's gonna take it.",
        "Brooke: This will only cause more issues in the family.",
        "Rick: I know, mom. Don't tell me. Tell dad.",
        "Brooke: Eric named Steffy C.E.O. of Forrester Creations?",
        "Rick: Yeah. She's not gonna turn that down.",
        "Brooke: Steffy?",
        "Rick: I know! It doesn't make any sense! Does she have as much experience as I do, a better record? No. She's never run the company. I have. And if anybody deserves the right to run it again, it's me, and if dad was thinking rationally, I would already be in charge.",
        "Brooke: He must have considered you.",
        "Rick: No, he didn't.",
        "Brooke: I don't believe this.",
        "Rick: That's how it is these days. Dad doesn't consult with anybody. He doesn't care about what's happening with the company. He doesn't care about what's happening with the clients. He does whatever Quinn tells him to do.",
        "Brooke: What do you mean?",
        "Rick: It was her idea.",
        "Brooke: Quinn told Eric to make Steffy C.E.O.?",
        "Rick: Yes.",
        "Brooke: But Steffy hates Quinn. Why would Quinn want her in charge?",
        "Brooke: Quinn is acting C.E.O. You're telling me she's going to just step aside and let Steffy take over?",
        "Rick: With dad's blessing.",
        "Brooke: Why would she do that?",
        "Rick: Obviously, it's a ploy. Quinn is using her C.E.O. position to get something from Steffy.",
        "Brooke: But Steffy would be her boss.",
        "Rick: Yeah, mine, too, which is horrible! We got to get dad to reconsider.",
        "Brooke: I don't know why Eric is doing this. Steffy was president for a while, but she never ran the company, never ran international or the day-to-day business. So, you're saying maybe this is a ploy? Maybe Quinn is setting Steffy up or trying to drive a wedge between ridge and Steffy.",
        "Rick: That could be. But I think this is about Wyatt. Before Quinn got involved with dad, sonny boy was the center of her universe. And Wyatt hasn't given up on Steffy. I think Quinn's trying to help Wyatt get Steffy back.",
        "Brooke: Using the company as bait?",
        "Rick: Would it surprise you? Everything that Quinn does has an ulterior motive.",
        "Brooke: So, Eric didn't question her or you or ridge? He just made Steffy C.E.O.?",
        "Rick: Yeah. And now that Dad and Quinn are married, she's in control. And he does whatever she wants him to.",
        "Brooke: I got to go talk to him.",
        "Nicole: What was that?",
        "Katie: Quinn? Hey, Quinn. I-I didn't see you standing there.",
        "Quinn: Well, this is my own house. Should I...announce myself?",
        "Katie: No. No, that's -- that's not what I meant.",
        "Quinn: What are you doing here, Katie?",
        "Katie: Uh, I came by to say hello to Eric.",
        "Quinn: Did you see him?",
        "Katie: Yeah. Yeah. He just went upstairs. I was just headed out.",
        "Quinn: Oh. Well, don't let me run you off. So, tell me, are you all unpacked next door?",
        "Katie: I am. You should -- you should come and see what I've done with the place.",
        "Quinn: Now?",
        "Katie: Sure. Y-yeah, sure. Why not? I mean, you and Eric have had me over to your house. I'd love to have you over to mine, and... you should see the view. It's to die for.",
        "Eric: Brooke, I'm glad to see you. It's been a while. I spoke to ridge. He gave me your good news -- you're getting back together again.",
        "Brooke: Yes, we are.",
        "Eric: I think that's terrific.",
        "Brooke: I'm glad you feel that way.",
        "Eric: I do. R.J. Must be over the moon.",
        "Brooke: [Chuckles] Yeah. He's really excited.",
        "Eric: Well, good. He should be. This is something to celebrate.",
        "Brooke: We're just not making a big announcement right now, because of everything that's going on -- what you're dealing with and the uncertainty of the company.",
        "Eric: [Chuckling] Yeah, but this is exciting! You should share that!",
        "Brooke: Yes, and we will. I just wish everybody in this family had as much to be excited about.",
        "Eric: But, Brooke, I don't want you to think that the trouble between ridge and me is gonna color how I feel about you two being together again. It's not.",
        "Brooke: No, of course not.",
        "Eric: Ridge and I are not good right now, but what's good in his life right now is you. I'd like to see him happy again, even if he can't be happy for me.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs softly] Eric... he's just really concerned.",
        "Eric: Yeah, I know. I know. Look, let's not talk about me. We're talking about you. I'm happy for you.",
        "Brooke: Thank you.",
        "Eric: You're so good for ridge. You really are. You -- you ease his tension, and you bring out his better nature.",
        "Brooke: I appreciate your support. I really do.",
        "Eric: Good.",
        "Brooke: I just wish you showed a little more of that support for rick.",
        "Eric: Rick?",
        "Brooke: He told me your decision.",
        "Eric: Of course he did.",
        "Brooke: Eric, he's our son. He's been devoted to Forrester creations. His commitment counts for something.",
        "Eric: Of course it does.",
        "Brooke: You're just saying that.",
        "Eric: No. I mean it.",
        "Brooke: So, I don't understand. Why would you put Steffy in charge? Rick has been a great C.E.O. He's been exceptional. He's run international. And he has qualifications beyond belief, and you just passed him right up.",
        "Eric: And you want to know why.",
        "Brooke: No. I know why. Rick told me. And he's very upset about it. So am I.",
        "Nicole: I'm sure your dad didn't do this to hurt you.",
        "Rick: He feels betrayed. But you're right. It's not payback. It's Quinn. And now that she's married to dad... she's more dangerous than ever.",
        "Katie: The kitchen is a bit snug, but it's plenty of room for will and for me. And I used a decorator for in here, and she really wanted to keep it minimalistic, which I agree, 'cause that's the style of the house, but I have a toddler, so I wanted it to feel homey and warm, and we got to get the fireplace fixed. The chimney doesn't work, so the holidays -- by the holidays, it'll be up and running. But just pretty much working on the upstairs right now. I spent the...",
        "[Dog barks in distance]",
        "Katie: ...For both of us, and please tell me to shut up! I have done nothing but yammer on since you got here. Um...can I get you something else? How 'bout I put together, like, a cheese plate or something?",
        "Quinn: No, thank you.",
        "Katie: Do you, uh -- do you want to sit? Oh, we can sit outside. The view is so beautiful.",
        "Quinn: Is that my house?",
        "Katie: Uh, yeah. Yeah, it is.",
        "Quinn: You like the view?",
        "Katie: I do. I love it. It's just peaceful. On a clear day, you can see all the way to the ocean.",
        "Quinn: I know Eric loves me.",
        "Katie: I'm sorry. What?",
        "Quinn: I just need you to know... I'm not jealous and I'm not insecure, but I-I have to reiterate what I said before. I don't want you spending time alone with my husband.",
        "Katie: Quinn, I just stopped by to --",
        "Quinn: I saw you, Katie. I saw you with my own eyes.",
        "Katie: You saw what?",
        "Quinn: What you did. I saw you kissing my husband.",
        "Rick: I'm sorry, Nicole. I shouldn't be laying this on you. You've already been through so much.",
        "Nicole: It's okay. If you want to talk about it, I'm here.",
        "Rick: I'm here for you, too. I know how much Zende means to you.",
        "Nicole: Things don't always work out the way we want them to.",
        "Rick: Yeah.",
        "Nicole: I didn't even know Steffy wanted to be C.E.O.",
        "Rick: Well, she hasn't exactly accepted the offer.",
        "Nicole: Is she worried about her dad?",
        "Rick: Ridge is gonna gripe no matter who's in charge. He thinks he's the only one who deserves to sit in that seat. Nah. If I was Steffy, I'd be worried about Quinn.",
        "Nicole: You really think she's behind all this?",
        "Rick: My dad said it was her idea.",
        "Nicole: Has Steffy forgiven her? I-I thought they didn't get along.",
        "Rick: No, not exactly. I mean, that's probably why she hasn't accepted it.",
        "Nicole: Then there's still time for Eric to change his mind.",
        "Rick: About the job, yeah, maybe. About Quinn? I don't think that's a possibility. See, the longer they're together, the more attached she gets. I'm really worried here, Nicole. It's scary how much influence she has over him.",
        "Eric: I realize rick and ridge are disappointed.",
        "Brooke: They're confused, Eric. So am I. Rick said this was Quinn's idea.",
        "Eric: Quinn thought it would be a good idea for Steffy to be C.E.O. -- that it might bring the family together. I agree.",
        "Brooke: I don't. I think it's going to cause more tension in the family.",
        "Eric: Rick will stay as the head of international.",
        "Brooke: Rick is going to be answering to somebody way less qualified than he is. And ridge is gonna be taking orders from his daughter.",
        "Eric: Well, that's gonna take some getting used to, isn't it? But it can be done. I worked under my sons for many years, and I recall once upon a time that I actually had to answer to you. You were giving me orders. It's not a punishment, Brooke. Forrester is a family business. We all have a stake in its success, and it's all our responsibility to get it done.",
        "Brooke: Eric...",
        "Eric: Look, Brooke, it's gonna be fine. Now... enough shop talk.",
        "Brooke: I still have my concerns.",
        "Eric: If they come up, if problems arise, we'll take care of them, all right? Now, we're finished with that. How 'bout your sister? You know she moved in next door. You know that.",
        "Brooke: You seem very excited about that.",
        "Eric: I am.",
        "Brooke: What's going on? You're a little cooped up here at home?",
        "Eric: No, that's not it. I'm very excited that she's next door. I like Katie. I think she's a terrific girl. She's, uh -- she's accomplished and she's caring. She's thoughtful. I've always been very fond of her.",
        "Katie: I did not kiss Eric, Quinn.",
        "Quinn: I saw you... before Eric went upstairs. You didn't know I was there.",
        "Katie: Are you talking about that peck on the cheek?",
        "Quinn: It was inappropriate. We talked about this, Katie. I told you that I didn't want you to come over to my house unannounced, but you didn't listen to me, because the very first thing you did when you moved in to this house is you came by to spend time alone with my husband. And I'm sure you didn't mean anything by it, but I have to wonder... what's really going on.",
        "Katie: Nothing's going on.",
        "Quinn: Really? So, this is all just a coincidence -- moving in next door, your spur-of-the-moment visits, asking Eric to help your son get into this fancy school. I mean, you're not trying to get close to him?",
        "Katie: I'm not going after your husband, Quinn.",
        "Quinn: But you are after something.",
        "Katie: Eric and I are friends. We have been for a very long time.",
        "Quinn: That's not gonna continue if this behavior persists. I'm not gonna let you play on my husband's sympathies, Katie.",
        "Katie: [Chuckles] Okay. That's not what I'm doing.",
        "Quinn: No?",
        "Katie: No. [Sighs] Listen, we don't have to make this into a big deal, okay? It's not a big deal. And I am -- it won't happen again. It was a friendly kiss... and I'm sorry if you found it inappropriate.",
        "Quinn: See, I understand why you want companionship. You're on your own, you know? You're in this big house on the hill. You must be feeling isolated.",
        "Katie: No, not at all. I have my son.",
        "Quinn: But not now. He's not home right now.",
        "Katie: No, he's not home right now.",
        "Quinn: So you're here by yourself. You must feel so alone.",
        "Katie: Are you trying to make me feel uneasy? Because that sounds a little bit like a threat.",
        "Eric: I'm really proud of your sister.",
        "Brooke: Me, too.",
        "Eric: Starting a new life.",
        "Brooke: She seems excited.",
        "Eric: Yeah. I think she is. It's a big step, isn't it -- starting a new life for herself and for her son?",
        "Brooke: She's moving ahead. She's planning a future.",
        "Eric: Yeah. And she's not looking back -- no regrets, no anger. No offense, but I really thought that she would be a lot more upset when you decided not to go ahead and marry bill.",
        "Brooke: I wouldn't blame her if she was upset with me.",
        "Eric: She hasn't been at all. She's focused on moving ahead and making a smooth transition.",
        "Brooke: Well, that's good to hear... because you're right -- she is a remarkable human being, and she deserves to be happy.",
        "Eric: Well, happiness is what she's working on, isn't it? She has a beautiful new permanent home and a wonderful school for her son.",
        "Brooke: And she has the best next-door neighbor ever.",
        "Eric: Thank you for that.",
        "Brooke: [Chuckles]",
        "Eric: [Chuckles]",
        "Brooke: Thank you for being there for her.",
        "Eric: It's my pleasure.",
        "Brooke: I know she can take care of herself. I just don't want her to feel alone.",
        "Eric: I wouldn't worry about that. I'll probably be seeing Katie a lot more now that we're neighbors. I just hope that Quinn and Katie can develop a friendship. Quinn doesn't have very many friends. She's the first one to admit that she's not a very easy person to get along with. But she's made big changes, Brooke. She really has. I think it would be wonderful to see Katie and my wife become closer.",
        "Katie: Are you trying to make me feel uncomfortable?",
        "Quinn: Like the way you made me feel when I saw you kissing my husband? No. No, Katie. I'm just trying to -- trying to understand why you would do that, especially after I opened up to you and I-I told you how I felt. See, I-I'm trying to behave myself, you know? I'm trying to act like Mrs. Eric Forrester because that's who I am.",
        "Katie: I know that.",
        "Quinn: Do you?",
        "Katie: Yes. And, truly, the last thing that I would ever want to do is make you feel disrespected or insecure.",
        "Quinn: You know, I-I don't believe that you are going after my husband, but I-I don't think you're being completely honest with me, either.",
        "Katie: Quinn, I am sorry if I overstepped, okay? I gave Eric a friendly kiss on the cheek to show my gratitude for his friendship, and, really, I never meant to upset you.",
        "Quinn: I'm so disappointed in you, Katie.",
        "Katie: [Sighs]",
        "Quinn: I mean... I told you how much I admired you, and I-I-I was hoping that -- that we could, you know, be friendly. You said that you would respect my home, but as soon as you moved in here, you went over there to spend time alone with my husband. I'm just wondering what else is going on.",
        "Katie: Nothing else is going on.",
        "Quinn: Okay. So, you and Eric are just friends?",
        "Katie: Yes.",
        "Quinn: Brooke is also your sister, and... you're Rick's aunt. See, Eric isn't getting advice from his family anymore, so maybe you thought, \"hey, he can listen to me.\"",
        "Katie: No.",
        "Quinn: Just a little kiss on the cheek to soften him up.",
        "Katie: Oh, my God. You have this so wrong, okay? It meant nothing. And it certainly wasn't a come-on or a manipulation. I don't really know what more you want me to say.",
        "Quinn: I want you to say... that you understand. You know, I'm trying to support my husband, and if it looks like I'm being overprotective, well, I am. Eric's family has put him through the wringer, and I won't let that happen again. And if it looks like I'm overreacting, well, maybe this seems crazy to you. You know, \"Crazy Quinn\" -- that's what your whole family calls me. [Sighs] You don't have to worry... 'cause if I ever have those urges again... I know how to handle them... because I'm not that person anymore. I am very grateful... for the life I have now, for the love I have with Eric... the commitment that we made to each other. I'm not gonna jeopardize that for anyone. Have I made myself clear? Katie?",
        "Katie: Yes, Quinn. You've made yourself perfectly clear."
