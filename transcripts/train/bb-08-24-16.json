    "Recap": [
        "Ridge shows up at Brooke's in time for breakfast. He says hotel life is terrible. Brooke was sure that Eric would apologize and invite him back home. Eric comes downstairs and asks Quinn if she has had second thoughts in the cold hard light of day. She says she has always done as she pleased so she is surprised to say that she does care what his family thinks and does not want to cause this problem. He says they can choose to be happy or not and make everyone else happy. Suffering is not a vitamin. He does not want her to walk away. There is a knock at the door and Quinn gets it. Wyatt walks in with a bag and says she does not live here, she is not staying, so pack up her bag to go. Steffy hugs Thomas and thanks him for letting her stay with him for the night. Liam calls as he forgot his work keys there last night. Thomas seizes the opportunity and invites him to come right over. Rick and Maya are both surprised when they walk in and find Ridge helping himself to breakfast. They even notice the bag in the den and wonder if he is moving back in. Shocked would be the word when they find he lost his home to Quinn. Quinn tells Wyatt to stop; she is not leaving. It is Steffy that is stalking her not the other way around. He says this is not negotiable; he will not lose Steffy. She says this can work. Any time Steffy wants to come see Eric then she will leave. Wyatt says he has had a lifetime of this and he is done.",
        "Eric comes back in and tells Wyatt to lay off or he will have him arrested and don't think he won't do it. Quinn is not going anywhere. Wyatt says his marriage should not suffer because of them .or more importantly Quinn. He says Quinn owes him on this, all the years of interference he had to run for her as he would come home and not know what he would run into. Now for the first time in his life he has someone in his life he can love and trust. So that is why he is going to get Quinn out of here. He tells Quinn if she loves him then she can prove it. Eric says if Wyatt guilts Quinn into leaving he will just come and get her again. If Steffy leaves him he cannot stop that but he will talk to her. He will get through to her and it will not be Wyatt or Steffy that dictates how he and Quinn live. Ridge tells them they do not know just how much influence Quinn has over Eric but they do know the power that Eric has over the company so they have to protect that. Liam is surprised to find Steffy and when she tells him she is moving in with Thomas for now. He says the craziest thing about Quinn is that she will move heaven and earth to get what she wants and did that to get Steffy and Wyatt together and now she will give him up so easily. He says this move is good; it is a move in the right direction. And he will be here for her, waiting for them to pick up right where they left off."

        "Ridge: Knock, knock. [Sighs]",
        "Brooke: Oh, good morning. You just missed breakfast.",
        "Ridge: I don't want breakfast.",
        "Brooke: But there's some fruit, croissants --",
        "Ridge: You know what I need? I need coffee. Stuff at the hotel is awful.",
        "Brooke: What? I thought Eric was going to apologize last night and insist that you move back in.",
        "Ridge: No, he did not. He did ask somebody else to move in, though.",
        "Brooke: No.",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles] Wow.",
        "Eric: This is good. You didn't bolt.",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles] Well, I heard some movement downstairs, on the off chance that it was an assassin or something.",
        "Eric: [Chuckles] You met Linda.",
        "Quinn: Uh, she didn't even bat an eyelash. She just laid out this beautiful service for us.",
        "Eric: Well, she's very used to our ever-changing list of residents here. If we ever do get an intruder, she'll just bring him tea and toast and marmalade.",
        "Quinn: [Laughs] I guess.",
        "Eric: Good morning to you.",
        "Quinn: Good morning.",
        "Eric: So, what about you this morning? You having any second thoughts in the light of day?",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] Well... you know I have always been selfish and stubborn. Or maybe self-reliant is a better word.",
        "Eric: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Quinn: But I always liked me, and I didn't care if anyone else did or didn't. So imagine my surprise to discover that I actually care what your family thinks about me.",
        "Eric: Ridge and I have a pretty complicated history. That scene he pulled last night was just the least of it, believe me. It doesn't even approach the worst of it.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] And then there's your granddaughter.",
        "Steffy: I'll go apartment hunting today.",
        "Thomas: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What's the rush?",
        "Steffy: Well, obviously I can't stay here.",
        "Thomas: Why not? Dad staying here would be a problem, not you.",
        "Steffy: [Sighs] Dad's probably looking for apartments today, too.",
        "Thomas: Dad's a nomad, though. He's lived everywhere. He lived at Brooke's, granddad's, our place, Paris. The world's his suitcase. You and I, we put down stakes.",
        "Steffy: I don't know. Maybe -- maybe Wyatt will get through to Quinn.",
        "Thomas: Is that what you really want?",
        "Steffy: [Sighs]",
        "Thomas: You're just gonna stick with this ultimatum? If Quinn leaves granddad, then you'll move back in with Wyatt?",
        "Steffy: That's one way it could go. [Sighs]",
        "Brooke: It doesn't make any sense!",
        "Ridge: My dad getting involved with an inappropriate woman? Makes all the sense in the world.",
        "Brooke: Wait, there's inappropriate and then there's criminal. What does he see in her?",
        "Ridge: What does Quinn see in him?",
        "Brooke: [Sighs]",
        "Ridge: She's not your average gold digger, is she?",
        "Brooke: Power. She knows if she's by his side, nobody can touch her.",
        "Ridge: Right, but I always thought she was about little boy Wyatt, her darling little kid. But she's gonna throw him under the bus. Steffy's not gonna tolerate Quinn moving into my mother's house.",
        "Eric: The way I see it, we can choose to be happy or we can choose to make everyone else happy. That's easy for me. I'm not big on self-sacrifice. Stephanie always said what doesn't kill you makes you stronger. I will never believe that misery improves you or that suffering is a vitamin.",
        "Quinn: Well, I don't have a philosophy. I just don't like being the reason that your family is turning against you.",
        "Eric: You don't want to cause me pain.",
        "Quinn: No.",
        "Eric: Then don't walk away.",
        "[Knock on door] Let Linda get that. I'll get dressed.",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles] Wow.",
        "[Knock on door] Linda?! All right. I'll just get it. Wyatt.",
        "Wyatt: Good. Go pack up everything you brought, 'cause this is not your home and you are not staying here.",
        "Quinn: I'm sure Steffy has been vocal about --",
        "Wyatt: Oh, she has not been vocal! She's gone!",
        "Steffy: You know I'm not gonna cook. Maybe on the weekends.",
        "Thomas: Steff, I can tell you this because I'm your brother. You're a terrible cook. Everybody just keeps saying you're good because you're really pretty, but... oh, I feel so much better. Um, we could be the takeout twins, though.",
        "Steffy: Hey, don't expect me to disappear when you have overnight guests.",
        "Thomas: Well, my overnight-guest list is extremely short right now.",
        "Steffy: So you don't really mind having a roommate?",
        "Thomas: Come on. Not if it's you.",
        "Steffy: [Sighs] Thomas, thank you so much. It really means a lot, seriously.",
        "Thomas: Yeah.",
        "Steffy: Thank you.",
        "Thomas: No problem.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Steffy: You can take that. I'll get my cell phone upstairs.",
        "Thomas: Okay, thank you.",
        "[Ringing continues]",
        "Thomas: I was just thinking about you.",
        "Liam: Because I left my work keys there last night and you found them, hopefully? Been looking everywhere. I can't get into my desk.",
        "Thomas: Well, you should come right over.",
        "Steffy: Hey, where you going?",
        "Thomas: Uh, I have to run some errands, and I'm gonna move my car otherwise I'll get a ticket.",
        "Steffy: Right now?",
        "Thomas: Yeah. Uh, oh, I, uh, I have a messenger coming. Would you just stick around and -- and listen for the door? Thank you.",
        "Steffy: Sure.",
        "Ridge: All right. Having d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.",
        "Brooke: Yep. I actually asked myself if I should pretend I forgot what you like for breakfast.",
        "Ridge: [Sighs] Memories are important.",
        "Brooke: Sometimes they're everything.",
        "Rick: Got to be kidding me.",
        "Maya: Do you know if your mom is planning a -- ridge. Hi.",
        "Brooke: If I'm planning what?",
        "Maya: A trip. We noticed an overnight bag.",
        "Ridge: That's mine.",
        "Rick: After all these years, you just pack your bag and show up here?",
        "Ridge: Nope.",
        "Brooke: Rick, come on. It's not like he's moving in.",
        "Rick: Really?",
        "Ridge: The driver dropped me off. I thought I could get a ride with your mom.",
        "Rick: Yeah, what driver?",
        "Ridge: The driver that took me from the hotel.",
        "Rick: What hotel?",
        "Ridge: The one I stayed at last night. Your dad threw me out of the house.",
        "Rick: That's the best news I've heard all day.",
        "Maya: W-well, did Eric give you a reason?",
        "Ridge: Uh, well, he wants the house to himself. Even he said the house was gonna be too big after mom died, so I don't know.",
        "Rick: He wised up. That's what he did.",
        "Ridge: No, he didn't. He got conned. And don't even think about moving back, because he's not living there by himself.",
        "Maya: He wouldn't.",
        "Ridge: He did.",
        "Rick: Quinn?",
        "Quinn: How could she do this to you? Doesn't a promise mean anything to her?",
        "Wyatt: You should avoid the subject of broken promises right about now.",
        "Quinn: What are you doing?",
        "Wyatt: I'm taking you home, to your real home, where you live alone and where no one should ever let you out of. This is your stuff, right?",
        "Quinn: Wyatt, stop!",
        "Wyatt: I am not leaving here without you!",
        "Quinn: Why are you not giving your wife this speech?! Why aren't you packing her up and taking her home?!",
        "Wyatt: Because this is all your fault! She had no choice but to leave me!",
        "Quinn: Wait a second. If you're gonna call me a manipulator, then at least recognize when you yourself are being manipulated.",
        "Wyatt: She told you again and again to stay away. So did I.",
        "Quinn: Your wife is the one who's been stalking me, not the other way around.",
        "Wyatt: You know what I mean! She told you to stay away from her and her family!",
        "Quinn: And -- and when has Steffy been so attentive to Eric? You tell me that! When have the two of you been here to see him or take him out to dinner?!",
        "Wyatt: This is not negotiable! I will not lose her. Do you understand me?",
        "Quinn: I understand. Look, we can compromise, okay?",
        "Wyatt: No, no, I'm not compromising.",
        "Quinn: We can compromise. And I'll tell you how. Any time Steffy wants to be in this house, I will leave the premises, okay? Christmas, Thanksgiving, any holiday. I swear I will.",
        "Wyatt: That's not enough! Do you understand?! You can't live here!",
        "Quinn: Why can't I have a little happiness?!",
        "Wyatt: Because you get bored with happiness! Marrying Deacon made you happy for what? Uh, one, uh, uh, one month?",
        "Quinn: No, this is different!",
        "Wyatt: Oh, no, this is classic you! You decide the only thing that's gonna make you feel fulfilled is the one thing that everybody warns you not to do, and you do it anyway. And guess what? I've had a lifetime of that, and I'm done. So if you don't know how to be happy, I'll show you.",
        "Quinn: What? Wyatt. Wyatt!",
        "Eric: Let her go, Wyatt. Let her go.",
        "Wyatt: I'm sorry, Eric, but I had her first, okay?",
        "Eric: This is assault what you're doing.",
        "Wyatt: So have me arrested.",
        "Eric: You think I won't?",
        "Wyatt: God. You have everything, Eric. Now why do you need her?! And why does my marriage have to suffer because of you two?!",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Steffy: Oh, hi! My, uh, my brother's not here, but I can sign. H--",
        "Liam: Uh... Thomas didn't mention you were here.",
        "Steffy: He didn't say you were coming, either. I guess I know what he was thinking.",
        "Liam: Yeah.",
        "Steffy: You better come on in.",
        "Rick: Are you sure?",
        "Ridge: Oh, yeah. Saw it with my own eyes.",
        "Rick: Well, how does he justify it?",
        "Ridge: It's his house, man.",
        "Rick: What? Did Quinn give him amnesia, too?",
        "Ridge: What'd he say? \"There's goodness in everyone.\" You know how he is when he's infatuated with somebody.",
        "Rick: Oh, yeah, he starts thinking with his [Whistles]",
        "Brooke: Heart! We all know that Eric has a very tender heart.",
        "Maya: Eric is too smart to let this go on. He is.",
        "Rick: You haven't been around him when he's had these ill-starred romances. It's a catastrophe is what this is.",
        "Ridge: She already has his ear. She's the one who talked him into being C.E.O. Again.",
        "Brooke: Well, I'm not sure if I would call that catastrophic.",
        "Rick: What if she decides to take over or -- or say that we're jewelry retailers or puts her shady son in charge of the accounts?",
        "Ridge: Hmm.",
        "Rick: What if she decides to marry dad or he decides to marry her?! You know that's what he does! Give him a month!",
        "Ridge: Yeah, I agree with rick. We don't know how much influence Quinn has over dad, so we have to limit the influence that dad has over the company and all of us.",
        "Rick: How we gonna do that? We'd have to unseat him as C.E.O.",
        "Ridge: I have a plan for that. Gonna need your help and your mother's.",
        "Wyatt: I'm sorry, Eric, but I have priority over this one. She owes me.",
        "Eric: What does she owe you, Wyatt? You're young, you're healthy, you're well off, you're climbing the corporate ladder at Spencer. What exactly is it that Quinn owes you?",
        "Wyatt: How about the childhood I never had? How about the years of caretaking, the interference I had to run to keep her away from the rest of the world? The sense of safety I never had, huh? What about that? The years and years of -- of just being afraid to come home 'cause I didn't know what the hell I was gonna walk into.",
        "Quinn: It's all true, Wyatt.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah?",
        "Quinn: And I know it. But it's all beyond my ability to repair.",
        "Wyatt: God. This is the first time in my life that I have -- I have someone else who I can count on, who I can trust, and now she left me because of you.",
        "Eric: I'm sorry to see you so heartbroken. But nobody made Steffy leave you.",
        "Wyatt: She's not leaving me. No one's talking divorce. She's just moving out.",
        "Eric: Well, this happens to young couples. You just have to muddle through.",
        "Wyatt: That's exactly what I'm doing. By getting her out of here. You say you love me? I say prove it.",
        "Eric: Wyatt, you can probably guilt your mother into leaving here with you and you can team up with Steffy and her father and everybody else who believes that the two of us don't deserve happiness. But you're too late. We found our way to it. You take her out of here, I'll just come get her and bring her right back here.",
        "Liam: Ah. I left these here last night.",
        "Steffy: What were you doing here last night?",
        "Liam: Talking. I've grown to like your brother.",
        "Steffy: [Chuckles] He's okay.",
        "Liam: So... so how's it gonna be at Forrester now that Quinn's rehired?",
        "Steffy: [Scoffs] That's not the worst part.",
        "Liam: Yeah, I know. I-I heard that your grandfather's moving her in with him.",
        "Steffy: I honestly don't know what to do, short of having him committed.",
        "Liam: Well, you could call adult protective services.",
        "Steffy: [Scoffs]",
        "Liam: I'm actually not kidding.",
        "Steffy: Yeah. You know it could have been prevented. I told Wyatt so many times I wasn't gonna allow Quinn near my family. [Sighs]",
        "Liam: Yeah. So, what are you -- what are you doing? You just gonna hang out here all day, or do you need a ride somewhere or...?",
        "Steffy: No, no, I-I have my car here, as long as it didn't get towed overnight.",
        "Liam: You were here last night?",
        "Steffy: Yeah. Hence the clothes.",
        "Liam: Ah.",
        "Steffy: I must have just missed you.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles]",
        "Steffy: I'm moving in with Thomas for a while.",
        "Rick: Spencer and his damn 12 1/2%.",
        "Maya: It's been a thorn in this company's side for years.",
        "Rick: You know, even if he does decide to give up his percentage, he's not gonna give it to you or me. He hates the both of us.",
        "Ridge: Right, but if Katie's awarded those shares in the divorce settlement, I have reason to believe she will sell them.",
        "Rick: Let me guess. You already made her an offer.",
        "Ridge: Let me ask you something. Who would you rather have run this company? Me or Quinn with dad as her puppet?",
        "Rick: [Scoffs] What did Katie have to say about it?",
        "Ridge: She talked to bill. He shut her down, of course. And she doesn't want to have a long, involved court case, so I think what she needs right now is some encouragement from the home team. Just not sure if that includes your mother or not.",
        "Brooke: This is your father we're talking about. I can't just joyously join in on these calculations of how to remove him from Forrester. Besides, it doesn't even take care of the problem -- this monstrous woman in Eric's life and in his home.",
        "Eric: Wyatt, I'm not blind or indifferent to what you're going through. But I've gotten much better over the years at understanding what's in my power to change and -- and what isn't. If Steffy wants to leave you, there's nothing any of us could do to keep her from doing that.",
        "Wyatt: She doesn't want to leave me.",
        "Eric: Well, then if she wants to come back, there's nothing we can do to stop her.",
        "Wyatt: I know exactly what'll bring her back! It's what I've been telling you over and over again, but you just don't give a damn, do you?",
        "Quinn: Of course, I do. But to what end? Every time your wife doesn't get her way, she's gonna threaten to leave you?",
        "Wyatt: There is nothing wrong between Steffy and me! It's you!",
        "Eric: I'll talk to her.",
        "Quinn: You will?",
        "Eric: Of course, I will.",
        "Wyatt: [Scoffs] It's not gonna do any good. As long as she is here living with you, it won't do anything.",
        "Quinn: Eric will get through to her.",
        "Eric: Your mother and I will decide where and how we live. Not you, not Steffy.",
        "Quinn: I don't want you to lose your marriage.",
        "Wyatt: [Scoffs]",
        "Quinn: She will listen to Eric. You know she will.",
        "Steffy: I gave Quinn an ultimatum. It's either she moves out or I do. And I guess she thought I'd back down.",
        "Liam: Yeah, well, she never really knew you very well. To her, you were always just the biggest stuffed animal at the fair.",
        "Steffy: [Chuckles] Yeah. Somebody needs to stand up to her.",
        "Liam: You know what the craziest thing is about Quinn?",
        "Steffy: Hmm?",
        "Liam: She doesn't actually know what she wants. Look at all the trouble she went through just to get you and Wyatt married, and now she's willing to throw that all away suddenly?",
        "Steffy: Yeah. Now my grandfather's, like, the biggest prize. I don't know. Maybe Wyatt will realize that he has to -- he finally has to cut Quinn loose.",
        "Liam: I wouldn't -- I wouldn't count on that.",
        "Steffy: He's furious with her.",
        "Liam: Yeah, he's furious with her, but he's also -- he's also the victim of a terrible childhood. You know, living with a woman who every day has to be rescued from herself 'cause she's so unstable. I don't think he knows how to cut that cord. I-I don't know if Wyatt can stop rescuing Quinn. Listen... I've worried about you, and this -- this move, this is, um, it's good. It is. It's a step in the right direction. But if you're gonna completely separate yourself from Quinn, I don't know how you'd do that with Wyatt still in your life. But...you know. I'll be here. I'll be waiting to pick up our interrupted lives right where we left off."
