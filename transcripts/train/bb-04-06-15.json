        "Carter is listening at the door when he hears Maya say this is her private business and she is proud of who she is. But Nicole counters that maybe but not who she was \u0096 Myron. Carter comes back when Nicole leaves and confronts Maya who knows he must have heard. Wyatt startles Quinn when she comes out of her daydream that she stabbed Brooke and told her look what she had forced her to do. Wyatt knows that look on her face means she is in some bad place. He feels like it is the calm before the storm since he just told her some pretty shocking news about Deacon. He had gone nuts and said he could have another chance with Brooke if it weren't for Quinn. He does not trust him. She says he may be right and they will find out soon. She says she won't do anything stupid. She is just going to stay here and ask Deacon about it, if he still has feelings for Brooke. Brooke finds Katie and Rick at the Skytop roof and she joins them. Rick says he is making progress with Caroline and trying to work things out with their working relationship. He tells her that her opinions are important to him and he'd like to see her around more. She brings up Quinn and why Rick re-hired her. Carter tells Maya this is crazy. They were involved and he would have known if she had been born a boy. She asks him to listen with an open mind. She never felt like a boy. She always liked pretty dresses and dolls but her dad wanted a boy so by God she was a boy. But in the core of her being she was a woman .and later she had surgery when she was with Jesse. The baby girl was his bio daughter but she was the mother in every sense of the word. Carter is livid that they slept together and she never told him. She admits she should have told him. He says their whole relationship was a lie and would have continued if they had not broken up. And now what about Rick ..does he know. She begs him to promise not to say anything to anyone. Brooke tells Rick that he can not re-hire Quinn never mind that she is completely out of her mind and dangerous. She is still unpredictable and volatile. Rick says she is changed and that is why Wyatt is still here to keep an eye on her.",
        "Deacon comes in and tries to defend himself to Wyatt. He tells his mother to call him if she needs him. Quinn says she trusted Deacon. She committed herself to him so is Brooke now going to be a problem? She says she is not interested in being second choice \u0096 either his or anyone else's. Deacon says he is trying to keep this honest and above board but it is not easy. She says he still has not given her an answer of how he feels about Brooke. He is there all the time and helps her and she even forbids them from getting married. He says she is the mother of his daughter and he will always care for her but she is not the one he wants to confide in and come home to. So Quinn needs to find her calendar and pick a date right now. Nicole states to Oliver that her sister will be happy for her to join in being a model and both of them will be happy then so it's just a matter of time. Rick tells Brooke that he holds on to his pain but it was the lies by Caroline he could not accept. But they can continue as friends now. She says he is mighty forgiving. Maya tells Carter that one of the reasons she never told him was this right now, people not understanding of what she went through to be who she is now. She learned from that and she will tell Rick when and if he proposes. Carter says he proposed and she did not tell him. She says it is not Carter's right to tell Rick. She is still the same woman he has always known. Carter says Maya played him for a fool and she will not do the same to Rick. And she knows how seriously Rick holds for people to tell him the truth. Rick walks in and hears the loud voices and wants to know what is going on. Carter snarls at him that he is single and the only loyalty he has is to FC. He was coming to find Rick and tell him something important he thinks he needs to know. Rick doesn't know the entire truth. Fear is on Maya's face as Carter tells Rick that they have a lot in common and he will never believe what it is."

        "Maya: I am proud of who I am.",
        "Nicole: But not of who you were. Myron -- my brother. You need to tell Rick. Why don't you just tell everyone that you were born a man?",
        "Maya: This is my private business!",
        "Nicole: Whatever.",
        "Maya: Nicole...you wait! Nicole, wait! How long have you been here? You heard.",
        "Carter: You were... born a boy?",
        "Katie: Yeah, I'm just finishing up here. I'll meet you at the office. All right. Well, they say the clothes make the man. That suit is like your armor.",
        "Rick: Well, you can't run a company in workout gear.",
        "Katie: You seem happy.",
        "Rick: Yeah, life's good. Revenue's up.",
        "Katie: And you have Maya.",
        "Rick: Definitely. Maya gets me. She knows how important honesty is in a relationship, no matter what the cost. So, yeah, I'm a lucky guy.",
        "Brooke: [Gasps]",
        "Quinn: No. No, no, no. I didn't want this to happen.",
        "Brooke: [Breathy] Why?",
        "Quinn: Why? Because I warned you, Brooke -- more than once. Now look what you made me do.",
        "Brooke: [Gasps] [Groaning]",
        "Wyatt: Mom. Mom! You're someplace else. Some dark, scary place in your mind, which always alarms me. What's up?",
        "Deacon: See, this is exactly why people shouldn't eavesdrop, you know? They get half the story right, which is probably what Wyatt's telling Quinn right now.",
        "Brooke: Maybe it's for the best.",
        "Deacon: Oh, and how would that work out, huh? Wyatt goes to Quinn and tells her that I still have feelings for you. She's either destroyed, or she goes ballistic.",
        "Brooke: [Chuckles] Quinn breaks up with you, and you're a lot better off.",
        "Deacon: I think we're gonna have to agree to disagree on that. I-I got to get going. I got to go plead my case. I don't want to lose her.",
        "Brooke: I'd wish you luck, but I don't. Quinn is toxic.",
        "Deacon: Yeah, well, so am I. Maybe that's why we work.",
        "[Door opens, closes]",
        "Brooke: [Sighs]",
        "Wyatt: Makes me nervous when you get all quiet. It's usually the calm before the storm.",
        "Quinn: I got nothing to say.",
        "Wyatt: I just gave you some pretty shocking news.",
        "Quinn: What's so shocking about it? I mean, Deacon's been gaga over Brooke for years. Are you sure about what you heard him say?",
        "Wyatt: Yes. He told her that it was making him nuts -- that he could finally have another chance with her if he wasn't engaged to you.",
        "Quinn: Huh.",
        "Wyatt: Was it a mistake telling you?",
        "Quinn: No. No, honey. Thank you, you know? I-I-I appreciate you looking out for me.",
        "Wyatt: Okay, 'cause I never trusted the guy.",
        "Quinn: I know. I know. Maybe your instincts were right. I guess we'll see.",
        "Wyatt: But what are you gonna do?",
        "Quinn: I'm gonna wait here for my fianc\u00e9... get to the bottom of Deacon's feelings for Brooke, and... take it from there.",
        "Katie: So, the new collection looks good.",
        "Rick: Yeah. Mom.",
        "Katie: Hi!",
        "Rick: Great to see you. Join us.",
        "Brooke: You're a nice surprise.",
        "Katie: Well, I had a meeting in the neighborhood, and I thought I'd check up on Rick.",
        "Rick: And I was just about to tell aunt Katie I'm gonna start trying to work out my differences with Caroline. We've talked a little, and we've made some progress since she's been in new York.",
        "Brooke: Interesting.",
        "Carter: I heard Nicole -- heard her say your name is Myron?",
        "Maya: My name is Maya.",
        "Carter: Yeah. She was joking then, right? You knew I was outside, so then it was just a big joke.",
        "Maya: No. No, Carter.",
        "Carter: This is crazy, Maya. This is -- this is crazy. We've been involved, right? I would have known.",
        "Katie: Okay, well, I'm gonna go. It's good to see you here.",
        "Brooke: Have a good day.",
        "Katie: Try not to burn the place down.",
        "[All chuckle]",
        "Rick: Well, I'm surprised we haven't seen more of you around here.",
        "Brooke: Yeah, well, you don't need your mother looking over your shoulder. You've been running the company with a lot of focus, a lot of drive.",
        "Rick: Mom, I want you to know that your opinion -- it's -- it's important to me, and it's welcomed.",
        "Brooke: Well, now, that you bring that up, yes, I do have an opinion about a certain decision that you made recently.",
        "Rick: Okay. Let's have it.",
        "Brooke: Quinn. How could you rehire Quinn? You know that she's absolutely insane.",
        "Quinn: It's okay, Wyatt. You can go.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, I'm not comfortable with that.",
        "Quinn: What are you afraid of, that I'm gonna throw myself off the roof? Don't worry. I won't. I'm going to sit here and wait for Deacon so we can have some straight talk.",
        "Wyatt: Should I be worried about him?",
        "Quinn: I'm not gonna do anything -- to myself or anyone else.",
        "Wyatt: Including Brooke?",
        "Quinn: Would you stop?",
        "Wyatt: Would you just answer the question?",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Deacon: I guess you don't have to be a genius. He told you.",
        "Wyatt: Yep.",
        "Deacon: You just couldn't let me handle my own business, could you?",
        "Wyatt: I didn't trust that you would. See, that's the thing, Deacon. I don't trust you. So if I see you aiming heartbreak at my mother, well, yeah, I'm gonna tell her.",
        "Deacon: Well, kid, I got to respect that. I mean, I don't know what Wyatt said to you.",
        "Quinn: This is simple, Deacon, really. It doesn't require a long-winded explanation. Is something rekindling between you and Brooke? Yes or no?",
        "[Camera shutter clicks] Come on. You must have a feel for my chances.",
        "Oliver: I just take the shots. A photographer with no opinion?",
        "Oliver: You look good. You move well. I'd love to work with you, but it's not my call. Thank you. Good luck. Thanks.",
        "Nicole: Is that the type you're looking for?",
        "Oliver: Open search. Not limited to type.",
        "Nicole: Oh, then you won't mind adding my name to that list.",
        "Oliver: We've gone over this. You get Maya or Rick to give to give you the okay, and I'm happy to.",
        "Nicole: Well, it'll be coming any minute now. I spoke with my sister, and Maya will support me all the way.",
        "Carter: I don't understand.",
        "Maya: Can you hear me with an open mind? I never identified as a boy. My first clues were that I-I liked pretty dresses and mama's heels. She said it was a phase I would outgrow, and my dad...pretended it wasn't happening. He wanted a boy, and, by God, he got one. Except I could never be that. I was different, but I didn't know what made me different. One day, I was visiting a little girl -- Valerie -- down the street. She brought out her dolls and asked if I wanted to play. And I don't know if it was her innocence or what, but... she saw me. She accepted me. And for the first time, I could be me without being ashamed or trying to hide. And eventually I realized that, in my heart, in the core of my being, I am a woman. And I needed my outside to reflect that.",
        "Carter: Surgery?",
        "Maya: Plural.",
        "Carter: L.A.?",
        "Maya: When I was with Jesse.",
        "Carter: He knew?",
        "Maya: He saw me through it.",
        "Carter: You said you had a daughter.",
        "Maya: It was Jesse's biological daughter, but I was her mother in every sense of the word.",
        "Carter: You kept this from me the whole time. We were sleeping together!! You -- did it occur to you that you should have told me that?!",
        "Brooke: You can't. You can't rehire Quinn.",
        "Rick: It's a good business decision.",
        "Brooke: How? How is that good for Forrester, being associated with some lunatic?",
        "Rick: We didn't let Quinn go because her pieces weren't selling. The consumer doesn't care if she's a little wacky. They just miss her jewelry.",
        "Brooke: I thought Ivy's line was doing just fine.",
        "Rick: Ivy's good, but she doesn't have Quinn's flair -- the eye of experience, the ability to anticipate trends.",
        "Brooke: So we just overlook the fact that Quinn is completely out of her mind?",
        "Rick: Well, nobody perfect.",
        "Brooke: And dangerous.",
        "Rick: Well, maybe not so much anymore. She seems to have settled a bit since she's been with Deacon.",
        "Brooke: Oh, that's not true. She's more volatile and unpredictable as ever.",
        "Rick: Well, that's why I have Wyatt to run interference.",
        "Brooke: Honey, he can only do so much. Working with Quinn is like saying, \"come in, trouble. Take a seat.\" You will regret it.",
        "Deacon: Wyatt, maybe it's time that you split.",
        "Wyatt: I'd rather stay and hear your answer.",
        "Deacon: Why, so you can evaluate it for truth?",
        "Wyatt: Someone has to.",
        "Quinn: I appreciate your caring... but I can handle my own personal life. [Smooches] Go ahead.",
        "Wyatt: Call me if you need me.",
        "[Door opens, closes]",
        "Quinn: I trusted you.",
        "Deacon: I know.",
        "Quinn: I committed myself to you more than I have any other man. You said that's what you wanted.",
        "Deacon: That is what I want.",
        "Quinn: So, has Brooke become a problem?",
        "Deacon: Quinn, I'm not gonna lie to you. I-I've always had feelings for her, but I'm here because --",
        "Quinn: You know what? This is really simple. I'm not interested in being second choice -- not yours, not anyone else's.",
        "Oliver: You seem pretty sure that Maya's gonna give me the okay to shoot you.",
        "Nicole: No doubt. She's my sister.",
        "Oliver: Doesn't mean she'll endorse you. Modeling is Maya's territory.",
        "Nicole: You may not know this about Maya, but she's a big believer in being your authentic self. I help her do that. She helps me. Everybody's happy.",
        "Maya: You are absolutely right. I should have told you.",
        "Carter: Why didn't you?",
        "Maya: Honestly, I don't walk around thinking about explaining that I'm a woman. It's who I am.",
        "Carter: That's bull. We were getting married, and this whole time, you're this other person. Our -- our whole relationship was a lie! And would I have stayed with you if you told me? Who the hell knows? I never got to decide. How is that fair?",
        "Maya: I should have told you.",
        "Carter: What about Rick? You tell him? Does he know?",
        "Maya: No. But I will. But until I do, you have to promise me that you will not say anything...to anyone.",
        "Deacon: I've been trying to do this relationship differently. Keep it honest, above board. It's just not always that easy.",
        "Quinn: You know, I didn't ask you a difficult question. Do you have feelings for Brooke or not?",
        "Deacon: I love you, Quinn. Don't you get that?",
        "Quinn: Now, now, see, that's -- that's not an answer. I guess signals tend to get mixed when it comes to Brooke. You're over there all the time, helping her out. Except she hates me. She's trying to turn you against me. She forbids you from marrying me.",
        "Deacon: She is the mother of my daughter. We have history together. And, yes, I care about her. She is always gonna have a place in my life. But not your place. She's not the woman that I-I confide in, the one that I cannot wait to come home to, and the one that I want to marry. And, by the way, why haven't we done that yet? Why don't you get your calendar right now and let's pick a date? Let's do this, 'cause I don't want to wait any longer.",
        "Rick: I understand your concern about Quinn, but I'm gonna keep my eye on her.",
        "Brooke: Honey...",
        "Rick: Now, the real take-away here -- you're not thrilled about Caroline.",
        "Brooke: Putting it mildly. I don't trust her anymore, after she discarded you.",
        "Rick: Yeah, well, it's no news. I feel the same way. But even though our marriage didn't work, we're still close. It'd be a shame if that didn't count for anything.",
        "Brooke: You're very forgiving.",
        "Rick: Not really. I hold on to my pain like it's some sort of prize that I won. Mom, it was the lies. It -- it was the lies that I couldn't deal with.",
        "Brooke: Well, you're with Maya now -- somebody who tells you the truth.",
        "Rick: Yeah, whether I want to hear it or not. Look, I'd love to stay and chat longer, but I really do have to get back. Love you. [Smooches]",
        "Brooke: Love you.",
        "Maya: You want to know one of the reasons that I never told you? This. What's happening right now. It is so hard to make someone who has never had to question their identity understand what I went through -- the changes that I had to go through to become my true self.",
        "Carter: Truth? You want to talk truth? Okay. You say you're not ashamed of who you are.",
        "Maya: I'm not.",
        "Carter: But you hide it.",
        "Maya: And that was a mistake. But I was so insecure, and I thought that you wouldn't love me. And I've learned from that now.",
        "Carter: Not if you're repeating it.",
        "Maya: I-I will tell Rick. I-I will -- when and if he proposes.",
        "Carter: I proposed to you! So that's not good enough, Maya. I had a hard buying you and Rick as a couple, and he is not my favorite person, but... he deserves to know who you are.",
        "Maya: And he will. But this is not yours to tell, Carter. It is my life.",
        "Carter: It's his life, too, just like it was mine. He has a right to know what he's into. He has a right to know who he's with.",
        "Maya: Me! Maya! The same woman he has always known.",
        "Carter: Keep telling yourself that. But we know how Rick feels about secrets, and they don't come bigger than this.",
        "Maya: Carter, please. Please.",
        "Carter: No, no, no, no. You played me for a fool! I won't watch you do the same thing to Rick.",
        "Maya: I cannot let you do this!",
        "Carter: You can't stop me!",
        "Rick: What's going on? Maya?",
        "Carter: I was coming to find you.",
        "Rick: Yeah, well, you don't have to anymore.",
        "Maya: Carter, please.",
        "Carter: I'm single. I've got no kids. My first loyalty is Forrester Creations and acting in the best interests for this company and you as C.E.O. And down the line, when the truth comes out -- and it will -- I don't want to be in the middle of something of some \"you should have told me\" mess.",
        "Rick: What truth?",
        "Carter: You and I have a lot in common, dude... and you won't believe what it is."
