        "Cassie: Sorry to interrupt you again, but we were just wondering if you could give us the name of the person who put in the winning bid on the shakespearean dagger.",
        "Auctioneer: The successful bid was made by the princess.",
        "Cassie: The princess?",
        "Auctioneer: Cassandra winslow.",
        "Dinah: I wonder if this beautiful little thing has ever drawn blood?",
        "Cassie: My god, she's here. She's here.",
        "Edmund: Yes, she is. She's using your good name and credit to bid on a dagger.",
        "Cassie: Okay. Look, I'm going to check this room. You check all the other rooms, okay?",
        "Edmund: Cassie, i'm not going to let you out of my sight.",
        "Cassie: I'll be careful. Meet me back here.",
        "Edmund: All right.",
        "Dinah: Cassie.",
        "Jeffrey: The situation is handled. Princess cassie is going to be out of commission for good. Yes, i know how dangerous she is. Trust me. You won't cross me this time. You wouldn't dare.",
        "Reva josh: (Laughing)",
        "reva: I mean, look at. We picked a night for a family dinner, we cleared our work schedules, and here we are. This is great.",
        "Josh: Yes. Well, some of us have cleared our work schedules.",
        "Reva: Yeah, what's up with that?",
        "Sandy: Well, I'm spaulding's indentured servant. Alan has me on a short leash.",
        "Reva: Yeah. Well, you know what? Spaulding can cool his jets for one evening. I'm not going to let anything spoil this night for us. In fact, i think we should make family dinner night a weekly event.",
        "Shayne: Well, as long as one of you guys is picking up the tab, i'm in.",
        "Reva: Well, pretty soon sandy will be able to pick up lots of dinner tabs and more.",
        "Sandy: Okay, now you've got my attention. But you should know I only have enough money to buy an appetizer.",
        "Reva: Not tonight. Have you completely forgotten your birthday's coming up? This is the year that you're entitled to your father's inheritance from his estate. And from what I understand, it's quite a hefty amount.",
        "Shayne: Well, what about my inheritance? I mean, can I live...",
        "Josh: Oh, son, I'm sorry. Yes, your inheritance. Let me see. Here's a ten. You keep the change, okay?",
        "Shayne: Oh, thank you.",
        "Reva: (Laughs)",
        "sandy: I'm sorry. I just remembered I have to check my email.",
        "Josh: You're going to do that right now?",
        "Reva: Do you want us to order anything for you?",
        "Sandy: Yes, please, the crab thing that i always get.",
        "Josh: Doesn't this seem strange to you? He's sitting here with his laptop and he goes over there to check his email. What is that about?",
        "Buzz: Pull yourself together and lay off the booze.",
        "Frank: Yes, sir. Any other orders?",
        "Gus: Listen, man... Frank, everything is going to be all right.",
        "Buzz: Frank, we're all angry about your suspension. But your tonight is about your sister and the wedding. I'm not going to let anyone or anything spoil it.",
        "Darci: Harley, I'm so sorry. Frank is under a tremendous amount of stress lately. Please don't let this ruin your night. Everyone, I would like to make a toast to the bride.",
        "Marina: Let's hear it for harley.",
        "Darci: Harley, you... You're the best. You're an incredible mom, sister, daughter and then future sister-in-law. I'm so excited. Anyway, you're going to make a wonderful wife. And gus is so lucky to have you. You're both lucky. Anyway, I love you. And I wish you happiness, and i know that we are all looking forward to your big day.",
        "Alan: Here, here.",
        "Darci: Oh, and, alan, alan, i would love to toast to you and all of your generosity. Thank you so much. And to the ultimate wedding planner, the woman behind all of the details of the preparations of this big event. We all owe you so much, mrs. Godfrey.",
        "Harley: What did you say?",
        "Darci: Nothing. I was just thanking everyone for everything.",
        "Alexandra: And it was a lovely toast, too.",
        "Harley: Did you say mrs. Godfrey?",
        "Darci: Did I? No, no. I don't think so.",
        "Harley: Yes, you did. I heard you. Why... Darci, why did you say that?",
        "Alexandra: Who else is next for a toast? Marina, you haven't made a toast.",
        "Alan: Marina, please make a toast.",
        "Alexandra: Jump up there, darling. Go ahead.",
        "Marina: What's going on?",
        "Brad: Oh, no. Oh, no.",
        "Harley: You're not alone. I'm right here, brad. I'm right here.",
        "Brad: God... Free.",
        "Harley: No, marina, let darci finish.",
        "Alexandra: I don't think darci had anything more to say.",
        "Harley: No, no, no. Don't rush her, alex. Go ahead, darci. Go ahead. What were you saying about mrs. Godfrey?",
        "Josh: Look, don't get me wrong, okay? I like sandy. I just don't understand him. He's living under the same roof as us, but i don't know anything about him or what he is or who he is. His past is a mystery.",
        "Reva: Well, his past is still painful for him to talk about.",
        "Josh: But even the present, you know, he's very secretive.",
        "Reva: Guarded. Not secretive.",
        "Josh: Either way, why would he be that way? He's knows we're there for him. We've proven that.",
        "Reva: Good.",
        "Shayne: Sandy's first family, they really screwed him up. I mean, maybe he'd be different had he grown up here.",
        "Reva: So we have to work harder to make up for lost times.",
        "Shayne: Well, don't work too hard.",
        "Reva: Why? What's the matter? You don't like parents who smother you?",
        "Josh: We... We don'T... Do we smother you?",
        "Shayne: It's more like leaning.",
        "Josh: (Laughs)",
        "reva: Well, you know why we do that, don't you?",
        "Shayne: Because i'm not that tall?",
        "Reva: (Laughs)",
        "josh: No, it's because we lean on you because you're strong, you know, you don't budge.",
        "Reva: Yes. And no matter how much we spin around you, you're always there holding down the fort.",
        "Shayne: I didn't do anything.",
        "Josh: I don't understand how you can still say that, shayne. I mean, after recovering from the accident and going through the forgiveness process with me, everything you've done for marina.",
        "Reva: And perhaps i should pick up the list there. What about when we found out who sandy really was? You were the first one to embrace him. And when marah decided she was going to leave town, you were there to give me a hug and say that she would always be with me even when she wasn't.",
        "Shayne: Well, that sounds like a lot to live up to.",
        "Josh: It is. But you've always been able to handle it.",
        "Shayne: Well, this is heavy stuff.",
        "Reva: Well, you know, parents do get sentimental at times. It's our right.",
        "Josh: We're just trying to say thank you for being sane and for being here. That's all.",
        "Jeffrey: I'm afraid i can't. I have a meeting with the mayor. I just hope to god it's not about her.",
        "Auctioneer: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Until next time. Arrivederci. (Applause)",
        "cassie: Anything? Anything?",
        "Edmund: None. None. I'm going to check outside.",
        "Cassie: If only we had a better idea of what she looked like.",
        "Edmund: We could talk to the auctioneer. She's seen her.",
        "Cassie: She doesn't remember anything. Young and blond, that's all she said.",
        "Edmund: How did we come to venice, end up at this charity auction, bid on the same item, and not even get a glimpse of her?",
        "Cassie: Because she probably knows who we are and what we're doing here. That's why she disappeared so quickly.",
        "Edmund: Yes, possibly. Either that... Either that or she caught a glimpse of you and panicked. She has to know what the real princess cassie looks like.",
        "Cassie: I never thought about that. My god, edmund, that's so creepy.",
        "Edmund: Don't worry, cassie, we'll find her.",
        "Harley: Go ahead, darci.",
        "Darci: Yeah, I think I'm finished.",
        "Harley: No, no, don't let these fancy spauldings intimidate you. You were making a beautiful speech. But you have to remind me. I'm so bad with names. Who is mrs. Godfrey again?",
        "Darci: It's no one, harley? It's just a name alexandra used to use a long time ago.",
        "Harley: Really?",
        "Alexandra: Oh, I'm afraid darci's very mistaken. She's confused. It's understandable.",
        "Harley: I don't think that darci is confused at all.",
        "Darci: Did I say something really, really wrong here?",
        "Harley: No, no. You didn't say anything. You didn't say anything wrong. Alex, let's take a walk.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, you want to take a little walk? (Laughs)",
        "harley: I want to take a walk.",
        "Gus: Hello, ladies.",
        "Alexandra: Hello.",
        "Gus: Hi, babe.",
        "Frank: Well, alexandra, you leaving us so early?",
        "Harley: No, we are just stepping for a little girl talk. That's all. Right, alex?",
        "Alexandra: Yes. Well...",
        "Gus: You haven't had enough of each other?",
        "Harley: We've had more than enough.",
        "Gus: Oh.",
        "Harley: But it's almost over. Really. Why don't you guys go inside? We won't be long.",
        "Buzz: You'd better not be.",
        "Alexandra: Mm-hmm.",
        "Buzz: Okay. Come on, guys, let's go.",
        "Frank: You okay?",
        "Harley: Mm-hmm. Okay, let's hear it. I want to hear about all those years in paris-- you and brad green.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, really, harley, why do you want to dredge all that up tonight of all nights?",
        "Harley: I'm not dredging up anything. Darci, however, was loud and clear.",
        "Alexandra: I'm afraid the poor girl doesn't know what she's talking about.",
        "Harley: Stop it, alex. I know. I know. I was with brad green when he was dying. And the man was panicked and he was disoriented. And I couldn't understand everything he was saying, but some of it was loud and clear. He said... He said \"not alone.\"",
        "Alexandra: So?",
        "Harley: And then he said \"godfrey.\"",
        "Alexandra: Well, that's a strange prayer. (Laughs)",
        "harley: That was no prayer. He said \"godfrey.\" Godfrey. He was talking about you.",
        "reva: Hi, marina.",
        "Josh: Hello.",
        "Marina: You guys don't know how good it is to sit down to a normal family dinner.",
        "Reva: Well, maybe you haven't met us. We're the lewises.",
        "Shayne: What happened?",
        "Marina: Who knows? Gus and harley's dinner was a disaster.",
        "Josh: Well, there's a surprise. You put the coopers and the spauldings together and the dinner's a disaster. Gee, go figure. You want something to eat?",
        "Marina: Oh, i ate. Sort of.",
        "Josh: Okay.",
        "Shayne: You should order something. I was going to get the succulent pig chop, but now I'm going to get the steak. (Laughter)",
        "marina: Oh, good, you've got to build up that pitching arm if you want to make it to the majors.",
        "Josh: What?",
        "Reva: The majors?",
        "Shayne: You guys...",
        "Josh: Are you throwing again?",
        "Marina: Good job, marina, you blew that one.",
        "Reva: Well, i'm glad somebody did. When were you planning on filling us in on this?",
        "Shayne: It's really not a big deal.",
        "Josh: Yes, it is.",
        "Marina: You know, i'm going to go check on sandy. Sorry.",
        "Josh: Okay, well...",
        "Shayne: Um...",
        "Josh: No, i'm glad to hear that you feel well enough to start pitching again. That's great.",
        "Shayne: I've just... I've just been throwing the ball around. I mean, throwing it around with remy and...",
        "Reva: So was marina joking around when she mentioned the pros?",
        "Shayne: Not really. I've been thinking about it.",
        "Reva: Well, it's okay if it's really what you want to do.",
        "Josh: Is it?",
        "Shayne: I don't know. I mean, right now a lot of things are up in the air.",
        "Harley: Talk to me, mrs. Godfrey.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, honestly, why are you dredging up my affair with brad green, huh? Haven't I paid enough for my obsession with that man?",
        "Harley: I don't care about your ridiculous affair with brad green. He was naming you as his partner in the drug trafficking scheme.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, you are grasping at straws.",
        "Harley: I wish I was. For gus's sake, I wish i was wrong. But I am not wrong. You were running drugs with brad green.",
        "Alexandra: The man was out for revenge, harley. I had to diminish all his powers at spaulding.",
        "Harley: You were running drugs to the mob through your family business. I feel sick.",
        "Alexandra: Well, you should, because you're wrong.",
        "Harley: No, i'm not. But I've never been so sorry to be right. Do you know how hard gus has been working to prove your family's innocence? This will... This will break his heart.",
        "Gus: So how's everything going in here?",
        "Alan: Well, darci just made a toast.",
        "Gus: Okay.",
        "Alan: And while she was speaking she called alexandra mrs. Godfrey.",
        "Gus: Oh, my god.",
        "Alan: And you know harley's a very smart woman.",
        "Gus: So now she knows that alexandra was brad green's partner.",
        "Alan: I think so.",
        "Gus: I got to... I got...",
        "Alan: Wait, wait, wait. Whoa, whoa...",
        "Gus: I've got to... I've got to...",
        "Alan: Gus? Gus...",
        "Gus: I've got to talk to her. I've got to explain to her why i lied to her.",
        "Alan: She doesn't... Wait a minute. Come here. She doesn't know that you know anything.",
        "Gus: Well, she will in a second.",
        "Alan: Alexandra is not going to tell her that you covered for her.",
        "Gus: Oh, come on. She's going to take the blame herself? Come on.",
        "Alan: You had nothing to do with this drug scheme. Look, she's not going to implicate you in this. She is going to protect you the same way you protected her.",
        "Gus: You're going to protect alexandra then, right?",
        "Alan: Well, i mean, what can i do for her now? But I'm just trying to keep you from making more trouble for yourself.",
        "Gus: This is unbelievable. I don't know... I lied to my fianc\u00e9e. I lied to her entire family, all the coopers. I put my relationship on the line, and I thought I was doing it to protect my family, and now you're moving the goal post? You're not going to protect her?",
        "Alan: Gus, you are my family, my son. I love alex. She's my sister. I don't want her to take the fall for this. But she knows more than anyone else that my children are the main priority in my life. And believe me, she will keep her mouth shut. Trust me on this.",
        "Buzz: Did i miss something?",
        "Darci: I don't know, buzz. All I care about is frank anymore.",
        "Buzz: He'll make it.",
        "Darci: Should i go talk to him?",
        "Buzz: No. I'll handle it.",
        "Harley: Brad green didn't have the clout to run an international drug trafficking operation on his own.",
        "Alexandra: All right, you go ahead and think that way if you want to, but it still doesn't mean that I had anything to do with it.",
        "Harley: Stop with the lies. You... You are as bad as vinnie salerno.",
        "Alexandra: (Sighs)",
        "harley: No, you are worse. You put drugs on the street. You poisoned young people. And what will you do to cover your tracks?",
        "Alexandra: Oh, please, i don't need to listen to any...",
        "Harley: Did you plant that evidence on my brother?",
        "Alexandra: Oh!",
        "Harley: Did you set up frank to take the fall for you? Did you do that?",
        "Buzz: What's going on?",
        "Ross: Good. You're here.",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, ross. Well, of course I'm here. You're buying, right?",
        "Ross: Jeffrey, this is serious. Politically and personally, this is a sensitive situation.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay. So much for happy hour. What am I being hauled on the carpet for this time, ross?",
        "Ross: It's not about you. And you know what I'm talking about. This is personal. And I wish i could just look the other way. Obviously I can't do that.",
        "Jeffrey: Personal? What do you mean personal?",
        "Ross: The case against frank. Frank and I have been friends for years. So none of this is easy.",
        "Jeffrey: Frank. Frank cooper. Of course. Right.",
        "Ross: Who did you think i was talking about?",
        "Host: Leaving so soon, your highness?",
        "Dinah: I want to make sure that this wonderful dagger is put in my safe at the hotel as soon as possible. So, yes.",
        "Host: I understand. It's a rare and exquisite piece.",
        "Dinah: Oh, I know. It's absolutely beautiful. I can't imagine the stories it could tell, the intrigue, the indiscretions, the nasty little paybacks. Forgive me. I do have a dark side, i imagine.",
        "Host: I'll have security escort you to the hotel.",
        "Dinah: That will not be necessary but I appreciate it.",
        "Host: I hope you have enjoyed your first night in venice.",
        "Cassie: I have. It has been wonderful. You know, the only disappointment is not being able to meet princess cassandra. Since she outbid me on the shakespearean dagger. So if she's still here maybe you could introduce her to me.",
        "Edmund: Coming up on \"guiding light\": What's this?",
        "Cassie: It's a key. Hotel san marco.",
        "Edmund: Cassie...",
        "Cassie: Don't tell me no.",
        "Dinah: Yes, i need to get on the next flight to the states. Yes. Final destination would be springfield. Jacksonand I'm david lambtoday at 5 \u00f3P c",
        "Cassie: She's gone. Well, look what she left behind.",
        "Edmund: That could have been anyone's, cassie.",
        "Cassie: No, i don't think so.",
        "Edmund: Why?",
        "Cassie: Because she was wearing this in a picture in a magazine i saw the other day. And it was one of the first charges on my credit card. A red velvet cape.",
        "Edmund: She left it behind and it's been torn.",
        "Cassie: Well, maybe she had to lose it to make a fast getaway.",
        "Edmund: Maybe. Something spooked her. You were asking about her, she knew about it or she spotted you. What's this?",
        "Cassie: It's a key. Hotel san marco.",
        "Edmund: That's the hotel right across the plaza. Cassie...",
        "Cassie: Don't try and stop me, edmund.",
        "Edmund: I was going to say we'd better hurry.",
        "Josh: This is not just about baseball is it, son?",
        "Shayne: No. But baseball's what I'm good at. Or at least what i was good at. It just feels like it's the natural choice.",
        "Reva: But it's not your only one.",
        "Shayne: No. So much has happened to me in this last year. I just... And now I have a second chance. I just want... Whatever I do this time it can't be all about me. It needs to... It's needs to make a difference. It needs to mean something, you know.",
        "Marina: So what you doing on your laptop over here?",
        "Sandy: Don't worry. I'm coming back. I was just checking my...",
        "Marina: You're hacking into someone else's computer system, aren't you?",
        "Sandy: Wrong.",
        "Marina: That's why you won't let me see the screen.",
        "Sandy: Nope. My cyber spy days are over.",
        "Marina: Then what's got you so freaked out?",
        "Sandy: If i tell you, can you keep it to yourself?",

        "Marina: I wish I knew what was bothering him.",
        "Sandy: Well, he has spent the last year recovering from the accident, and now that he's on his feet, he has to figure out what he's going to do with the rest of his life, which is huge.",
        "Marina: I know. I don't care what he does. I just want to be a part of it.",
        "Ross: I'm concerned about frank cooper's situation. And these days who else would i be talking about?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, I don't know, ross. You look so serious. I thought you were going to give me a slap on the hands for some infraction or other.",
        "Ross: No, i'm afraid that frank is the only who apparently got caught red- handed.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, it does seem pretty open and shut. Just the way i like them. I mean, the chief of police conceals evidence to protect the woman that he loves. It's almost too easy.",
        "Ross: Mm-hmm. I feel that I've been a little close to it, and i could use some perspective. I was hoping that you could help me out.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, you know... The facts kind of speak for themselves. I mean, darci was the only cause that frank needed. She was frightened because she knew that salerno was behind eden's death, and she thought that she was going to be next. So frank was out to get salerno with any charge that he could find. But that doesn't mean that he's guilty of, you know, a cover-up in a drug bust or anything like that.",
        "Ross: Certainly doesn't make him look innocent.",
        "Darci: Hey, frank. Hey... Come on. We all know how hard everything is for you. But no matter how horrible things are, it will past. We will catch whoever is setting you up. Gus will make sure of it. Just as you would for him.",
        "Frank: Well, you know, i would feel a whole lot more confident if he wasn't so tight with the spauldings.",
        "Alan: Gus, gus. You cannot go out there. Think about what it will do to buzz if he finds this out about alex.",
        "Gus: Harley's probably telling buzz everything right now.",
        "Alan: No, she is not. She is a cooper. They protect their own just like i do. Now stay out of it.",
        "Buzz: Let's get back to the party, okay?",
        "Harley: Oh, we'll be right in, daddy.",
        "Alexandra: Harley, I really think you should go on in and be with gus. It's your big night.",
        "Harley: Sure is a big night. Please go in, because we have to finish this.",
        "Alexandra: What about your daughter here? She won't leave one little detail to the wedding planner.",
        "Harley: You dragged my brother into this? You ruined his life to save your own skin?",
        "Alexandra: Harley, I want you to stop and I want you to think.",
        "Harley: I don't want to think about any of this anymore.",
        "Alexandra: If you really thought there was anything of these wild accusations you would have said something to buzz.",
        "Harley: You leave my father out of this. We'll deal with you and my father later. Right now you're going to start talking. I want to hear about the cover- up and the drugs and how you framed my brother. I want to hear everything. Now.",
        "Cassie: She's gone.",
        "Marina: So how did your folks take the baseball news?",
        "Shayne: Um... Actually it wasn't that bad.",
        "Marina: This has turned into such a weird night. Nothing is going how it was supposed to.",
        "Shayne: Yeah, well, that's kind of how our whole year has been.",
        "Marina: You think we can put it all behind us? I mean, the car accident and everything that carrie tried to do with our families? Just pick up where we left last summer?",
        "Shayne: I wish.",
        "Sandy: Not to be sandy spoilsport, but you can't just go back. Physics, newton's first law: Objects in motion tend to stay in motion unless acted on by an exterior force.",
        "Marina: Thank you, professor foster.",
        "Sandy: All I'm saying is the only constant is change.",
        "Reva: Well, so much for our great family dinner.",
        "Josh: There's nothing wrong with dinner for two.",
        "Reva: You know, shayne didn't even ask us what we thought about what he wanted to do with the rest of his life.",
        "Josh: Yeah, well, the timing wasn't all that good, you know. We were just talking to him about being, you know, being a rock for the family and all that kind... And besides, whatever happens with shayne, you're still going to have one son living at home.",
        "Reva: Sandy. Even though he's insistent on keeping his whole life just strange... Be a stranger to his own mother.",
        "Josh: (Grunts)",
        "reva: I know, you said that he was being secretive, but i said he wasn't, and...",
        "Josh: Eat your salad.",
        "Reva: It's not that i don't want them to go on and live their lives and be successful...",
        "Josh: You just want them to do it locally.",
        "Reva: Well, is that so bad?",
        "Josh: No, it's not a bad thing. It might be difficult for them. Where is this coming from?",
        "Reva: Yesterday i babysat for robbie so that michelle could go shopping. And we went to the park, you know, and we played in the sandbox and I pushed him on the swings, and the whole day was about discovery, you know: How high he could swing before he got scared. And questions-- he asked me so many questions, it got a little annoying. But mostly it was this magical, magical time that I never had with my kids, any of them.",
        "Josh: Well, you have that time with them now.",
        "Reva: Yeah, now when they don't need me anymore.",
        "Josh: They'll always need you, reva.",
        "Reva: You know what i mean. Not like when they were robbie's age.",
        "Josh: Yeah, it's funny you're talking about this. I was just thinking... Let's get a puppy.",
        "Reva: A what?",
        "Josh: A puppy. A puppy would need you.",
        "Reva: I'm thinking bigger, joshua, a lot bigger.",
        "Josh: Are you talking about having another baby?",
        "Frank: Oh, darci, this whole mess is just killing all the people i love.",
        "Darci: We'll live through it. We love you. Let's go. Give me your keys. Come on.",
        "Alan: What is done is done. Now there's nothing you can do about it. Move on and accept it.",
        "Alexandra: I have nothing to admit.",
        "Harley: Fine. I'll tell the springfield police department.",
        "Alexandra: Really? And that's the way you're going to treat family, with threats and accusations?",
        "Harley: You are not my family.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, really? The minute that gus slips that ring on your finger, i will be as much your family as frank or buzz.",
        "Harley: Never.",
        "Edmund: Room service, your highness. Hello? All right.",
        "Cassie: This is definitely her.",
        "Edmund: Is that your perfume?",
        "Cassie: Yeah, it is. By the gallon.",
        "Edmund: All right, all right. See if you could find any photos of her. Find out what this woman looks like. Where's this going to lead us? Come here, look at this.",
        "Cassie: What does it say?",
        "Edmund: It's in italian. \"Welcome back, princess cassie. Hotel de marco.\" Well, she's obviously a regular here.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, and a big spender. I mean, how do you keep up this kind of a shopping spree and hotel bills? She has to pay them.",
        "Edmund: A royal title will buy you a lot of time.",
        "Hotel manager: There is no problem, your highness. This is what we're here for.",
        "Dinah: Well, I don't know where I put the key is the point.",
        "Cassie: Okay, throw this over her head and i'll tackle her.",
        "Edmund: Let me handle this.",
        "Cassie: Do you want to tackle her?",
        "Edmund: Cassie, will you get by me and let me handle this?",
        "Reva: Why, joshua lewis, are you thinking about another baby?",
        "Josh: Don't do that. I'm asking you.",
        "Reva: Well, since you put it that way.",
        "Josh: You are.",
        "Reva: Breath, joshua. No, the last thing i want is another baby. Unless of course it's a grandchild. But no puppies either.",
        "Josh: Okay. All right. All right. Fair enough. So what is this? What's on your mind?",
        "Reva: I don't know. You know, I think maybe shayne and I are at the same place in life right now, where we know we want something more but we don't have a clue what it might be.",
        "Josh: This doesn't sound like something a couple of weeks at cross creek would take care of.",
        "Reva: How about a couple of weeks skydiving?",
        "Josh: Oh.",
        "Reva: Nascar racing.",
        "Josh: Yeah.",
        "Reva: Bunji jumping.",
        "Josh: How much wine have you had tonight?",
        "Reva: It's just, you know, that time I spent with michelle, it was... It was so great. She's got this whole new energy about herself that... That... I mean, her accident was horrible and what happened to her, but now she can reinvent herself. She doesn't have to be anyone special; she can be whoever she wants to be. And I remember what that was like, to have that kind of freedom. It was a like a whole new world, a whole new world of discovery, you know. It was... Everything is new, you know, like with robbie. I want to experience that kind of life again.",
        "Josh: Okay. That's great. Can you do that without actually losing your memory?",
        "Reva: Do you remember the way we were when we were shayne and marah's age? We were going to take on the world. We wanted it all and we were going to go for it.",
        "Josh: Yes, we were young and stupid.",
        "Reva: I like to think of it as daring and unstoppable.",
        "Josh: We had some wild times, reva, but we were also in constant crises. I just don't think i could do that anymore.",
        "Reva: I think that we could have the wild times without the crises.",
        "Josh: I kind of... Don't hit me. I kind of like our life the way it is now.",
        "Reva: Me, too. But why can't we push the envelope a little, you know? Take some chances. Are you with me?",
        "Shayne: You guys want to get something to eat?",
        "Sandy: I'll be there in a second.",
        "Marina: Sandy's being mysterious again.",
        "Sandy: That's me, mystery man.",
        "Shayne: All right, mystery man. Well, you can find whatever you're looking for later. Let's hit it. Steak awaits.",
        "Dinah: I was sure that, you know, the key was in my bag. I don't know how i lost it.",
        "Cassie: (Sneezes)",
        "dinah: What's that? Did you hear that?",
        "Hotel manager: No. What?",
        "Dinah: I've had such a long night. You know, forget this. You don't have to keep trying your keys. You know, I'm going to go downstairs and grab a nightcap. Thank you.",
        "Hotel manager: Whatever you wish.",
        "Dinah: Thank you. Buona notte.",
        "Hotel manager: Ciao.",
        "Edmund: Well, you scared them off.",
        "Cassie: I'm sorry. It's all these flowers and the perfume. (Sneezes)",
        "edmund: Shh. Shh. Shh. Just stand back, all right. All right, they're gone.",
        "Cassie: Come on, let's go find her.",
        "Edmund: Cassie? Cassie?",
        "Cassie: What?",
        "Edmund: She knows we're here. She's long gone. And we could spend months running around europe.",
        "Cassie: Oh, my god, we're so close to finding that woman. What if we never get a second chance, edmund?",
        "Edmund: Well, it's possible. It's possible.",
        "Cassie: As much as I want to catch this freak, I know we got to get back for harley's wedding.",
        "Edmund: I know, cassie. I know. As soon as the wedding's over say the word, we'll come right back and start looking for her.",
        "Cassie: Well, don't think i'm not going to take you up on that. We've come all this way and all we have to show for it is this red cape.",
        "Edmund: All right. I'll make a few calls, get a private investigator and he'll pick up where we left off. Cassie, cassie, the princess will surface, the investigator will find her, take a few photos.",
        "Cassie: Thank you. Thank you so much, edmund. You know, I couldn't do this without you. What now?",
        "Edmund: Take a gondola ride with me through the canals of venice.",
        "Cassie: Do we have time?",
        "Edmund: It'll be our farewell to venice. And don't worry; we'll make it back in plenty of time for harley's wedding.",
        "Jeffrey: I'll tell you what, ross, I'll do some digging and i'll see if I can't find something that can help frank.",
        "Ross: All right. Thank you. I appreciate it.",
        "Jeffrey: Sure. (Phone rings)",
        "ross: Dinah?",
        "Dinah: Daddy. Hi. I haven't called too late, have i?",
        "Ross: No, not for me. But it must be the middle of the night for you, that is if you're still in venice.",
        "Dinah: Well, I wish was there with you.",
        "Jeffrey: Forgot my paper.",
        "Dinah: Daddy, are you there? Did I lose you?",
        "Ross: Listen, i hope you don't think that you can come back here. I mean, not with murder charges still pending against you.",
        "Dinah: You're mayor now. You can work out a deal, right? I miss you and bill so much.",
        "Ross: Look, maybe in a few weeks I can get some time off and I can come see you over there.",
        "Dinah: I want to come home.",
        "Ross: Sweetheart, i'm sorry, but springfield is no longer your home. It can't be. I mean, if you step foot in this town, the district attorney is obligated to throw the book at you.",
        "Dinah: Daddy, if you talk to him, he might give me temporary immunity.",
        "Ross: Are you kidding? This is jeffrey o'neill, the district attorney. You don't know this man. Dinah? Are you there?",
        "Dinah: Yeah. Yeah, I got the message.",
        "Ross: So are you going to stay where you are?",
        "Dinah: Don't worry, daddy. I won't put myself in any more danger. Ciao. Buona sera. This is princess cassandra winslow. I need to make some travel arrangements. Yes, i need to get on the next flight to the states. Yes. Final destination would be springfield. Thank you.",
        "Harley: You don't know anything about family or loyalty.",
        "Alexandra: And I'm not the one who's trying to tear this family apart right now.",
        "Harley: I had my suspicions about you, alex. From the start i had my suspicions. But gus trusted you. Gus believed in you always. And for his sake i told myself i was wrong. And I would give anything to be wrong right now.",
        "Gus: I cannot do this.",
        "Alan: No, no.",
        "Gus: I'm going out there.",
        "Alan: Gus! Stop! Listen!",
        "Buzz: What's going on?",
        "Harley: I don't know which is worse. The fact that you lied to gus from the start or the fact that you are still lying. That you are standing here trying to save your sorry butt. It's over, alex! Admit it. Admit what you've done.",
        "Gus: Stop! Stop! More, okay. I can't let you do this any more, okay.",
        "Alexandra: All right, gus, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.",
        "Gus: No, I'm not talking to you. All right, i'm talking to you.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Gus: This is not about alex, okay? This is about you and me. And babe, if you keep going down this road, i'm afraid there's not going to be a you and me anymore.",
        "Lizzie: Well, it's the least i can do. I mean, we are...",
        "Tammy: Friends? Is that what you were going to say? You need to stop using that word, lizzie, because the last thing we are now is friends."
