        "A jealous Ricky confronts Jamal about his intentions toward Casey. Ian takes a blood sample from Lucy as she sleeps. After Casey has a vision that Lucy's death makes the headlines, she rushes to check on her friend. Casey almost blows it, but she manages to assure Lucy that angels don't have inside information. Casey transfers some of her energy to Lucy in an attempt to help her fight whatever is wrong. After Lucy asks the angel to stay in her guesthouse, she agrees to ask her boss. Kevin informs Joshua that he knows the reason for Frank's recent behavioral changes. He also knows that Joshua is the one who made the offer on the Recovery Room. After looking at Kevin's most recent painting, Joshua injects him with something to make him follow orders. Joshua informs Kevin that he has plans for Port Charles, and Kevin is to bring them to life on canvas. Ian takes the blood sample to Chris, who knows without being told that it was taken from Lucy. A VH1 representative arrives to talk to the band, but threatens to leave when she learns that Stephen Clay himself won't be back. Jack talks her into using the vampire rumors as a hook. Joshua arrives and informs everyone that he is the one in charge. Realizing that Jamal knows too much about her concern for Lucy, Casey uses her magic on him. Finding an empty bag of blood in the trash, Lucy realizes that Ian lied about her ability to help him. Chris and Ian are stunned when the lab results indicate that Lucy is being poisoned by her own blood."
