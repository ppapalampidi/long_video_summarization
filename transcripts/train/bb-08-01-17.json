    ],
    "Recap": [
        "Brooke asks Bill who really won the fashion show \u0096 Spectra or Forrester. He says the kids won with all their bidding for charity; so everyone won. It was a big charity event and very successful. He suggests that everybody find their own way home and they need some alone time on the jet so she can be with her stallion. Alone he checks his phone and sees that Spectra received the most votes. Wyatt and Katie discuss it too and then dismiss their kiss as being caught up in the moment. Katie said they were just celebrating, just a onetime thing. However, she is totally into it when he kisses her again. Zende tells Nicole that the best part of the day was seeing her on the runway. She outdid all the models. Sally asks Thomas if he thinks they could have won but his mind is not on that so he opts out of the discussion. He thinks back on what Bill said about Caroline dying. Rick asks Nicole if modeling is in her future. She laments that she could get used to it. Caroline calls Bill and tells him again that she is not going along with this lie anymore. Bill reminds her that she wants Thomas for her son so it's best to leave it as it is as Thomas and Sally are getting even closer so she needs to split that up fast. Then there will be a miracle cure; Thomas will never know. Thomas needs to man up and be with his son so if he doesn't then they need to give him a nudge. He tells her to hang up and call Thomas now.",
        "Zende tries to set up a celebration between him and Nicole and Maya and Rick. Rick says another time as he has a conference time coming up. Nicole too says she is bushed and just wants to take a soaking hot bath but gives permission for Maya who missed all the activities to go with Zende. He wants to talk to Nicole alone. He says he knows she is tired, so is he but this is a milestone and they should stay together. It won't be the same without her by his side. Finally she agrees and tells him to go on and she will catch up with him after a bath. Caroline calls Thomas and lets Douglas call him Daddy. Sally finds Thomas alone in thoughts and says the show is over so now they have time to share. He says it is her time to shine but he needs to be with his son. He slowly tells her that Caroline is dying. Sally is devastated. He says he does not know what he is going to do but he knows he has to get to New York. He missed out on being a father and now he needs to be there for him .both of Douglas's parents for the few months they have. Sally says she loves him even more. She hates that he is leaving but it is what he has to do. She will be there for him as he is worth it. He is proving that by being there for Caroline and her son. They part with a kiss as Bill looks on. Then he spies a skyscraper and he is in focus again with his own goal."

        "Brooke: Another successful Spencer summit.",
        "Bill: We raised a ton of money for charity.",
        "Brooke: Okay. So, who really won -- spectra or Forrester?",
        "Bill: The kids. Just bidding, no voting.",
        "Brooke: Really? I want the truth.",
        "Wyatt: No real winner?",
        "Katie: [Laughs]",
        "Wyatt: The results had to have been tallied. They were going straight to his phone. I mean, could spectra fashions really have won this thing?",
        "Katie: I guess the world will never know.",
        "Wyatt: That's just crazy.",
        "Katie: [Chuckles]",
        "Wyatt: But I, um... I have to commend you.",
        "Katie: For what?",
        "Wyatt: A job well done.",
        "Katie: [Chuckles]",
        "Wyatt: This fashion show was a huge success. And now we -- now we get some time to relax.",
        "Katie: Right. Yeah. I mean... I really enjoyed working with you, and -- and I look forward to future projects.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles]",
        "Katie: But I, for one, am glad that this one is over.",
        "Wyatt: Oh. Right? I was counting down the hours.",
        "Katie: I mean, we've been working really hard, and with the excitement and the jet lag, I mean, that -- that must explain it.",
        "Wyatt: Uh, explain what?",
        "Katie: Why we kissed.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] Right. Yeah. I mean, overworked... just coming down off that high of the fashion show, raising $1.1 million.",
        "Katie: Yeah, that is awesome.",
        "Wyatt: That's -- that's got to be the reason why we -- we, uh -- we kissed.",
        "[Both chuckle nervously]",
        "Nicole: You did it! My husband, the designer.",
        "Zende: It's just swimwear.",
        "Nicole: No. Babe, that's a huge market. Don't sell yourself short.",
        "Zende: Fine. I won't.",
        "Nicole: You are on your way to stardom.",
        "Zende: Doesn't count what you 'cause you're my wife and you got to say it.",
        "Nicole: What? No. All of the applause, all the money that was raised for charity, baby, that's you. That's your hard work. I am so proud of you.",
        "Rick: Thank you for coming. We appreciate everything.",
        "Maya: I'm sure you think we're overreacting. No, no, better be safe, huh?",
        "Maya: Definitely.",
        "Rick: So, Lizzy just needs rest. That's it? Rest and a lot of liquids. Call me if her fever gets any higher. But I suspect she will be just fine tomorrow morning.",
        "Maya: I hope so.",
        "Rick: Yeah. Au revoir.",
        "Rick: Au revoir. And enjoy the rest of your stay.",
        "Maya: Merci. Merci.",
        "Maya: Oh! What a relief, huh?",
        "Rick: Well, you could've done the show after all.",
        "Maya: You know what? I wouldn't have been able to concentrate, really, and it's probably over by now.",
        "Rick: Don't worry about it. You made the right call. Unless, of course, spectra wins the showdown. Then we'll just have to blame you.",
        "Maya: Mm-hmm.",
        "Zende: You know what the best part about that show was?",
        "Nicole: Hmm?",
        "Zende: Seeing you in my designs.",
        "Nicole: Oh, please.",
        "Zende: I'm serious. You were amazing. Those other models, they did all right. Nobody fell. But you -- you really showed up.",
        "Nicole: Well, as long as you think so, that's all that matters.",
        "Zende: Well, I do think so. And I also think it's time for me and you to get a glass of champagne or something. It's time to get lit.",
        "Nicole: Already?",
        "Zende: Why not? My first show, you know? You know we're gonna go all night.",
        "Nicole: Yeah. I mean, I was just hoping we could check on Lizzy at the hotel before we hit the club.",
        "Zende: Okay.",
        "Nicole: I'm sorry. I'm trying not to worry, but Maya wouldn't miss the show for nothing, so Lizzy must be really sick.",
        "Zende: Listen, we can do that, okay?",
        "Nicole: Mm-hmm.",
        "Zende: Right? We do that. Then... then we turn up, okay?",
        "Nicole: Okay. Sounds good.",
        "Zende: Sounds good, okay. Come on, let's go.",
        "Sally: No winner? Do you think spectra could've won and bill not want to tell us?",
        "Thomas: I don't -- I don't know. Maybe.",
        "Sally: You know what? I'm gonna go talk to Eva. I bet she has some answers.",
        "Thomas: Okay.",
        "Douglas: Hi, daddy. I miss you, daddy.",
        "Bill: It's Caroline. She's dying, Thomas. You know what you have to do. My niece and your son need you in new York.",
        "Thomas: [Sighs]",
        "Bill: I told you, we all win.",
        "Brooke: Okay. So, all that voting that the people did, that wasn't tabulated?",
        "Bill: This was a charity event and a big success at that.",
        "Brooke: Yes.",
        "Bill: Right?",
        "Brooke: Mm-hmm.",
        "Bill: Okay. Now, listen -- I have a great idea. We're gonna head over to the club for the wrap party, we'll spend a little time there... and, uh, then we're gonna head over to Stella Maris. Everybody else can take the plane home, and we'll meet them back in L.A. 'Cause I think you need some alone time with your...",
        "[Whinnies]",
        "Brooke: [Laughs]",
        "Bill: ...Stallion.",
        "Brooke: [Laughs] Oh, you make me melt every time.",
        "Bill: Well, good.",
        "Brooke: Okay. You know what?",
        "Bill: What?",
        "Brooke: I'm gonna go back to the yacht...",
        "Bill: Mm-hmm.",
        "Brooke: ...And get ready for tonight.",
        "Bill: I'm looking forward to that.",
        "Brooke: [Laughs]",
        "Bill: See you in a little bit.",
        "Brooke: Mm-hmm.",
        "Katie: I mean, obviously, that's -- that's what it was.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. Fashion show's bogging up our brain and causing random kissing.",
        "Katie: Right. Yeah. Um, random. I mean, we -- we've been working really hard, and it's only natural that we would want to celebrate our success.",
        "Wyatt: Celebrate -- that's -- that's a good word for it.",
        "Katie: And I, for one, am really glad that it's -- it's done.",
        "Wyatt: Huge relief. I, uh... yeah, it's a kiss. Consenting adults do that.",
        "Katie: [Laughs] Um, right. I mean, it was a one-time thing. We were just, uh...",
        "Wyatt: One time.",
        "Katie: ...All caught up in the moment.",
        "Wyatt: Mm-hmm. One time, possibly, yeah.",
        "Katie: And there a million reasons why we should never, ever do it again.",
        "Nicole: So, the doctor said that Lizzy's fine?",
        "Rick: Yeah, nothing to worry about. She just needs some rest.",
        "Maya: She was sleeping when you went and checked on her, right?",
        "Nicole: Out like a light. Little jealous of her, myself. I am ready for bed.",
        "Rick: Do I sense a model in the near future here?",
        "Nicole: I mean, I don't know. It was fun. I wouldn't rule out doing it again.",
        "Maya: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Sounds like somebody's caught that modeling bug.",
        "Nicole: No. Come on. I -- okay. Let's say that I could get used to it, all right?",
        "Maya: Aha-ha! There it is.",
        "Rick: I bet you'll get used to it.",
        "Zende: Yeah, she'll be out there again.",
        "[Indistinct conversations]",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Bill: Caroline.",
        "Caroline: Now he answers.",
        "Bill: Been a little busy with the summit.",
        "Caroline: Yeah, I've been a little bit busy, too, stressing about this lie.",
        "Bill: Well, don't stress. It'll kill you.",
        "Caroline: That is not funny. Thomas thinks that I'm dying. He thinks our son is losing his mother. I'm not gonna go along with this lie anymore.",
        "Bill: Don't lie. Just avoid telling the truth for a little while longer.",
        "Caroline: Wow.",
        "Bill: You want your son to have his father full-time, don't you?",
        "Caroline: Of course I do, but not --",
        "Bill: We're speeding that process along. How many more milestones should Thomas miss because he's drooling over that trailer-park redhead? The sooner Thomas dumps sally and goes back to you, the better -- for everyone.",
        "Bill: Stick with the plan.",
        "Caroline: How? How is it working? Thomas is upset, I'm a wreck...",
        "Bill: Thomas is going to go into \"save the day\" mode. I'm telling you. All right? He's gonna be the heroic father who swoops in and gives the mother of his child a few happy last days.",
        "Caroline: And when I don't end up dying?",
        "Bill: Miracle cure, misdiagnosis -- whatever. We'll figure it out.",
        "Caroline: I don't want him to move to new York. I don't want him to be with me out of guilt.",
        "Bill: Who cares?",
        "Caroline: I care!",
        "Bill: That nitwit needs to man up and be a father to his son. He's not doing it, so we're giving him a -- a nudge in the right direction. Listen, in a few months, you'll be cured, and he'll be back in love with you. He never stopped loving you. He told me himself. You know that.",
        "Caroline: I don't know.",
        "Bill: I do.",
        "Douglas: Daddy!",
        "Bill: Is that Douglas?",
        "Caroline: Yeah. Say hi to uncle bill.",
        "Douglas: Tell uncle bill I love daddy.",
        "Bill: He's asking for his daddy.",
        "Caroline: Yeah, he's been asking for him a lot since we left L.A.",
        "Bill: Then why are you talking to me? Hang up and call Thomas.",
        "Caroline: Uncle bill, I don't --",
        "Bill: Call him. Call him now.",
        "[Cell phone beeps]",
        "Nicole: I definitely understand the rush you were talking about before. Being on the runway...",
        "Maya: Incredible, right?",
        "Nicole: All eyes on you.",
        "Zende: The design, you know. You were there! People saw you.",
        "Rick: Okay, Mr. Designer!",
        "Zende: I'm kidding, baby girl, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.",
        "Nicole: It was a blast, though.",
        "Maya: I bet. I wish I was there.",
        "Nicole: Well, Lizzy comes first.",
        "Maya: Totally. But now all this talk about it...",
        "Zende: I mean, just because you missed the show doesn't mean you can't turn up with us, right? We're all going out.",
        "Maya: I want to, but, uh... should we rock, paper, scissor for who stays with Lizzy?",
        "Rick: No, you go. You know, actually, I've got to finish up work for that conference call tomorrow. In fact, all three of you should go out and have some fun.",
        "Nicole: Or just the two of you?",
        "Zende: What do you mean?",
        "Nicole: I know I said I'd go, but I'm really tired.",
        "Zende: You don't want to go?",
        "Nicole: I mean, fighting through a crowd, can't understand what people are saying, and... I don't feel like drinking, anyway.",
        "Zende: You don't have to drink. I just want you to be with me. You know, today was a huge day.",
        "Nicole: I've been on my feet all day, and I just want to take a hot bath and relax. But you go, celebrate, have fun. But partying is the last thing I want to do right now.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "[Cell phone beeps]",
        "Thomas: Hey.",
        "Caroline: Hey. How was the show?",
        "Thomas: Oh, it was good, it was good. Um... [Clears throat] I actually thought we were gonna win, but your uncle pulled something a little strange. I'm really glad you're not like him.",
        "Douglas: Is that daddy?",
        "Thomas: Hey! Is that him?",
        "Caroline: Yeah, yeah. Um, he's been asking about you a lot, so that's why we called. Do you want to talk to him?",
        "Thomas: Yeah, absolutely. Put him on.",
        "Douglas: Daddy! Daddy!",
        "Thomas: Hey, buddy. How are you?",
        "Douglas: Hi, daddy.",
        "Thomas: You okay?",
        "Douglas: I miss you, daddy.",
        "Thomas: I miss you, too.",
        "Caroline: Hey. Me again. Thanks for that. I guess he's been thinking about you a lot lately.",
        "Thomas: Yeah, I've been thinking about him, too. How are you?",
        "Caroline: I'm fine, Thomas. Really, I'm -- I'm fine.",
        "Thomas: I am so sorry that you are going through all this.",
        "Caroline: I am, too. Look, I-I should go.",
        "Thomas: Yeah. Yeah, do whatever you have to do.",
        "[Cell phone beeps]",
        "Sally: Hey. Hey.",
        "Thomas: Hi.",
        "Sally: Still upset about those results? I just talked to Eva. I could not get any information. But, hey, show's over, and... we got to deal with it.",
        "Thomas: Right.",
        "Sally: Thank you... for being there for me and for what you've done for spectra.",
        "Thomas: Hey, hey, hey. You have been there the whole time. I was a part of that. Sally, you moved to L.A. To make your dreams come true. This is your chance. Um... something's come up. I need to go see Douglas.",
        "Sally: You're a good man. You miss your son.",
        "Thomas: It's not just that. It's, uh... it's Caroline.",
        "Sally: You miss her, too.",
        "Thomas: She's dying.",
        "Zende: Can I talk to you for a minute? Look, I know you're tired, okay? I'm tired, too, but... this is a huge milestone.",
        "Nicole: I know, and I'm thrilled for you, but... you don't need me to go to make it more special. You'll be surrounded by people who want to drink and dance.",
        "Zende: None of those people are my wife, okay? And I want you by my side. You know I can't milly rock by myself. I need you with me. Come on.",
        "Nicole: Okay.",
        "Zende: Yeah? All right! Okay. I'm happy now. Thank you.",
        "Nicole: But I still get my bath. So, you go, and I will catch up.",
        "Zende: It's a bath. Do your thing, soak your body, okay? Get ready to come out, because tonight, it's gonna be a night to remember.",
        "Sally: Caroline is dying? But she's so young.",
        "Thomas: Yeah, I... I don't -- I don't know. It's just some sort of auto-immune disease. It's rare.",
        "Sally: Oh, my God. And you've been dealing with all of this? Losing the mother of your son? Douglas...",
        "Thomas: Yeah.",
        "Sally: [Breathes deeply]",
        "Thomas: I don't know what to do, exactly. I just know I have to get back to new York. She hasn't -- she hasn't told anybody about this. So if you would just keep this between us... I haven't told my family. They don't know why I'm gonna go. I just know I have to. I don't know what I can do. I think I've, uh... I've, uh...missed out on being a dad... a dad to my son, and I -- I have a lot to learn as a father. And, uh...I need to be there for that. If I can give my son... parents -- both his parents -- for a few more months, then he deserves that.",
        "Sally: I understand. And I love you even more for... being who you are and making this decision. I hate that you're leaving... but it's what you have to do. I will be there... waiting... because you're worth it. And the fact that you're doing this for your son... and his mother proves that. [Sniffles] I love you, bucko. [Sniffles] [Crying]"
