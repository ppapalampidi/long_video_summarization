        "Ricky: So what's up, man? You still a little freaked out, or what? ",
        "Jamal: Well, I wouldn't call it freaked out, ok? I'm just a little concerned that this Stephen Clay dude, how he got Marissa\u2019s unlisted cell phone number. That's it, dude. ",
        "Ricky: Man, who cares how he got it. ",
        "Jamal: Dude, I care. ",
        "Ricky: Hey, Marissa, you want to stop pacing? What are you trying to do, dig a trench in the floor? ",
        "Marissa: Look, I'm nervous, ok, Ricky? ",
        "Jamal: Look, when is this guy, when is he supposed to show, anyway? ",
        "Marissa: About an hour ago. ",
        "Ricky: Guys, guys, guys, relax. It's rock 'n' roll time, all right? You guys got to get used to it. ",
        "Jamal: Oh, my God. Yeah, right, this coming from the expert right here that didn't even believe any of this would happen. ",
        "Ricky: All right, hey, I\u2019m man enough to say when I was wrong. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah. ",
        "Marissa: Well, you know, I just can't wait to meet him is all. ",
        "Ricky: Well, from what I here, nobody's actually seen this guy. ",
        "Marissa: Oh, yeah, that's right. ",
        "Jamal: What? ",
        "Marissa: No, no, no. ",
        "Jamal: Come on. ",
        "Marissa: No, really, check this out -- no one has ever seen his band perform live and they don't even show up on their own music videos. It's crazy. ",
        "Ricky: Yeah, man, it's part of the Stephen Clay Experience. It's the mystery of who they are. ",
        "Marissa: Yeah. ",
        "Jamal: Or maybe they're just butt-ugly. ",
        "Ricky: Could be. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, could be. ",
        "*********************************************************************************************",
        "Frank: You still haven't found Livvie? No, just keep looking. She's in no shape to stay away for long. Yeah, I'll be right here. Call me if you know something, all right? Bye. ",
        "Ian: Hey. ",
        "Frank: Hey. ",
        "Ian: So here I am back in town, I see nothing's changed. What's Livvie done now? ",
        "Frank: She lost the baby. ",
        "Ian: I'm sorry. ",
        "Frank: She refuses to believe that and she took off before Karen could help her with the follow-up procedure. ",
        "Ian: That's not good. ",
        "Frank: It doesn't end, does it? ",
        "Ian: With Livvie? ",
        "Frank: No, with all of us. This darkness that seems to follow us around wherever we go. ",

        "Woman: You Marissa? ",
        "Marissa: Uh-huh. ",

        "Rafe: Hey, cousin. ",
        "Lucy: Oh. Oh, I know what this is. I have been under an extreme amount of pressure lately and stress. I haven't been feeling very well or very happy, so I'm just sort of imagining something happy that might happen to me. So it's like I know logically Rafe has passed on to another dimension, he's gone to heaven, so I know that he can't possibly be walking toward me and he can't possibly -- it's a vision. It's a vision, that's all. Just a simple, pure vision. That's all it is. A vision that appears to be moving behind me. A vision that -- laughs at me. It's -- what -- you're here? ",
        "Rafe: I'm back for good this time. ",
        "Lucy: For sure, for sure, for sure? ",
        "Rafe: Yes. ",
        "Lucy: I mean, really? ",
        "Rafe: Yes. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh. You're real. You are. You're back. ",
        "Rafe: Lucy -- ",
        "Lucy: Oh, my god! How? How? ",
        "Rafe: That's a long story. ",
        "Lucy: Ok, well, tell me. No, I mean, wait -- ",
        "Rafe: I -- ",
        "Lucy: But what about Alison? Where's she? ",
        "Rafe: Oh, she's, you know -- well, you know, we're getting married in a couple months. ",
        "Lucy: You're trying -- you're -- really? ",
        "Rafe: Yeah. ",
        "Lucy: Please tell me I\u2019m not dreaming this. I need some good news. Tell -- it's true? For sure? ",
        "Rafe: Yes, yes, it is. ",
        "Lucy: Oh! Oh! ",
        "Rafe: It's true, yes. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, this is so -- I've got something to celebrate for a change instead of everything so dark and awful. ",
        "Rafe: Ok, all right -- ",
        "Lucy: So you're happy and you're fine? ",
        "Rafe: Yeah, about that -- slow down. ",
        "Lucy: What? Yeah, what? ",
        "Rafe: I wish it were all good news. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, please don't do that. What? What is it? ",
        "Rafe: Alison just found out her father died. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, my god, that's horrible. How? ",
        "Rafe: In a boating accident. Actually, her mother came to town to tell her herself. ",
        "Lucy: Elizabeth came to Port Charles? ",
        "Rafe: You know her? ",
        "Lucy: Oh -- knew her, sort of. I mean, I knew of her because we sort of have in common that we came from the wrong side of the tracks and worked our way up, if you know what I mean. So did you actually meet her? ",
        "Rafe: Oh, yeah. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah? And how did that go? ",
        "Rafe: Well, let me just say that on my long trip back, the one thing I didn't lose is my instinct for trouble, and she is big-time trouble. ",
        "*********************************************************************************************",
        "Amanda: Oh, darling, you know, it's so wonderful having tea like this with you. We should do it again. ",
        "Alison: Yeah. Yeah, we will. Um -- Nana, there's something I need to talk to you about. ",
        "Amanda: Well, of course, darling. You can tell me anything. What is it? ",
        "[Doorbell rings] ",
        "Alison: I -- let me -- let me just get that, ok, and get rid of whoever that is. Sorry. Mother, what are you doing here? ",
        "Elizabeth: I didn't think it was fair to make you deliver the news to Mother Barrington that her son is dead. ",
        "Alison: Oh, my God. ",
        "Alison: Nana? Nana, are you ok? I'm so sorry. Are you all right? ",
        "Amanda: Is it -- is it true? ",
        "Alison: Nana, listen to me, daddy's gone. I'm so sorry. ",
        "Elizabeth: I'm so sorry. ",
        "Alison: I'm so sorry. What the hell is the matter with you? ",
        "Elizabeth: I'm sorry. I -- ",
        "Alison: What, you're not going to be happy until you wipe us all out, is that it? ",
        "Alison: Nana, I called your doctor and he said that if you just take one of these, you're going to feel a lot better, ok? ",
        "Elizabeth: Is there anything that I can get for you, Amanda? ",
        "Amanda: My son is dead. ",
        "Alison: I know. I'm sorry. ",
        "Amanda: I haven't spoken to him for such a long time, and now gone. ",
        "Alison: I'm so sorry that you had to find out this way. ",
        "Amanda: Very typical of your mother, I'm afraid. ",
        "Elizabeth: I didn't know you were here, Mother Barrington. ",
        "Amanda: Oh, really? ",
        "Elizabeth: I just thought that we should get together. ",
        "Amanda: Is that why you're here, Elizabeth? To grieve over the loss of my son? ",
        "Elizabeth: He was my husband. ",
        "Amanda: Yes, the first in a long series of heartbreaks, I'm afraid. ",
        "Elizabeth: I'm very well aware that you never cared for me, Mother Barrington, but maybe we should get past that right now, just for the moment. ",
        "Amanda: I'll never get past that, Elizabeth. But I do want to know how my son died. ",
        "Elizabeth: It was a boating accident. ",
        "Amanda: And? ",
        "Elizabeth: Malcolm slipped overboard. ",
        "Amanda: And? ",
        "Elizabeth: We searched for him. ",
        "Amanda: Oh, yes, of course you did. You were so in love, weren't you? ",
        "Elizabeth: Alison's right, I should leave. You've -- it's been a very big day for you. We can continue this conversation some other time. ",
        "Alison: Oh, no, you don\u2019t. You insisted on barging in here, so I think that you should tell Nana everything -- and I mean everything. ",
        "Elizabeth: You can do it yourself, Alison. You know the rest. ",
        "Alison: Oh, no, see, I don't think that I do, but I\u2019m guessing that you know all the details of my father's death, so I want you to tell her everything -- and don't leave out the part about how you tried to save him. ",
        "*********************************************************************************************",
        "Lucy: Do you want to tell me what it is about this Elizabeth that has you so riled up like this? ",
        "Rafe: You mean besides the fact that she treated Alison like an afterthought for her entire life? ",
        "Lucy: Well, yeah, there's that. I'll give you that, but there's something else going on here, cousin. What is it? ",
        "Rafe: Like I said, just an instinct. ",
        "Lucy: Yeah. Well, you know, I happen to have a certain understanding of people like Elizabeth because, well, let's just say I could've sort of been like her. What's that old-fashioned term? I think it's \"gold digger.\" ",
        "Rafe: Yeah, but you never walked out on a child of your own. Do you know years would go by and Alison wouldn't see either one of them? ",
        "Lucy: I know. That's bad. I think it's because Elizabeth used to walk around trying to tell everybody -- anybody that would listen -- that she wanted to bag a rich husband. ",
        "Rafe: Ok, ok, so she traded her daughter for time alone with her husband and his platinum card? What is that? ",
        "Lucy: I think what it was is that's the only way she thought she could be a Barrington. If she had his child, then maybe that would give her a permanent residence in the Barrington dynasty, the only way she could keep it. ",
        "Rafe: Right, till death do them part. ",
        "Lucy: Yes. But you have to understand that did doom Elizabeth to this unhappy, loveless, icky marriage. ",
        "Rafe: Mm-hmm, and she let her child grow up by herself. The thing is Alison\u2019s not dealing with this well. I mean, she says she doesn't feel anything, but it's like someone took her whole lonely childhood and just threw it up in her face. ",
        "Lucy: Ok. Ok. Well, you know me, the half-full-glass thing -- maybe there's something good that can come out of this. ",
        "Rafe: Oh. How do you figure? ",
        "Lucy: Ok, well, think about it. This woman loses her husband. He -- Malcolm dies in a boating accident. What's the first thing Elizabeth does? She comes back to Port Charles to see her daughter. Maybe -- maybe they'll somehow get close through this. ",
        "Rafe: Yeah, nice try, but I have a feeling that Alison\u2019s mother has another agenda for being back here. ",
        "Lucy: Ok, what is that based on? ",
        "Rafe: It's based on -- I don't know, when Alison and I were on our way out of town, I just started to get this weird vibe, and I can't explain it, but I just felt like we needed to be back here. ",
        "Lucy: Wait. Oh, cousin, I got to tell you this -- I had the same feeling. I was in Canada -- with Kevin. I need to tell you all about that. It's not good. But I had that same feeling that I had to get home, I had to get back to town because something was about to change in Port Charles again. What do you think that means? ",
        "Rafe: I don't know, it could be a family thing. ",
        "Lucy: Are you telling me you think this has something to do with the family business? ",
        "Rafe: It's a possibility. ",
        "Lucy: Are you saying you think that maybe Elizabeth is a vampire? ",
        "*********************************************************************************************",
        "Ian: So what -- so you're saying that the Avatar was the father of Livvie\u2019s baby? ",
        "Frank: No one was supposed to know, but I guess it doesn't matter now. ",
        "Ian: Of course it matters. It matters to you. You weren't really in control at that point. ",
        "Frank: See, that's what I\u2019m talking about. Things happened here that don't happen anywhere else -- strange, inexplicable things with human consequences. ",
        "Ian: Yeah. Lucy believes that Port Charles exists in some kind of a -- a spiritual vortex where evil and good fight each other. ",
        "Frank: That makes sense to me. ",
        "Ian: Yeah. So what's the battle now, Frank? What are we looking for? ",

        "Jamal: Mmm. ",
        "Ricky: Yeah, thank you. Thank you. ",
        "Marissa: So, you're the Stephen Clay Experience? ",
        "Woman: Uh-huh. That's Mick, that's Cass. And I'm Reese. ",
        "Jamal: Oh, oh. Hmm. ",
        "Reese: We liked your sister song. ",
        "Marissa: Thanks. ",
        "Reese: You're the bloke that wrote the music? ",
        "Ricky: Yeah, that's me. ",
        "Reese: Cute. ",
        "Jamal: Yo, man, what you doing? ",
        "Reese: Mick's got low blood sugar. If he doesn't eat every hour, he turns into a wolf. ",
        "Jamal: And? ",
        "Reese: It's a medical condition. ",
        "Jamal: Yo, dude! You better back up. ",
        "Marissa: Uh, yeah, so, where -- where's Stephen Clay? ",
        "Ricky: Yeah, where's Stephen? He's supposed to be here by now. ",
        "Reese: Well, he sent us out to check you out. ",
        "Jamal: Which basically means he isn't going to show. ",
        "Marissa: Ok, check us out for what? ",
        "Reese: Nobody just meets Stephen. ",
        "Mick: Yeah. ",
        "Marissa: Uh -- no, that's not what he told me on the phone. He said he was going to be here. ",
        "Reese: Well, I guess you just didn't hear right. ",
        "Mick: So, how did this sister of yours die, babe? ",
        "Marissa: What? ",
        "Mick: How'd she check out? ",
        "Jamal: Uh, look, party's over, ok? You and your little freak show need to step on out of here, ok, right now. ",
        "Ricky: Hey, calm down. He gets a little worked up -- ",
        "Jamal: No, don't -- don't worry about me. ",
        "Ricky: About people touching his food. ",
        "Mick: You don't like us? ",
        "Jamal: Ok, I'm sorry. What I meant to say is step off and get out. ",
        "Mick: Ooh. ",
        "Jamal: Get out, dude. Bounce, leave. ",
        "Mick: We got a little bad-ass here, Reese! ",
        "[Cass laughs] ",
        "Reese: Mick doesn't like bad-asses. He eats them for lunch. ",
        "*********************************************************************************************",
        "Elizabeth: Just what are you suggesting, Alison? ",
        "Alison: Well, it's a simple question. Did you try and save my father? ",
        "Elizabeth: Well, if you mean did I dive into the Aegean sea myself, the answer is no. ",
        "Amanda: Are you trying to say that my son might still be alive? ",
        "Elizabeth: We conducted an exhaustive search for his body. I personally did not see him go overboard, but we did everything that we could to save him. ",
        "Amanda: Well, it doesn't matter now. ",
        "Elizabeth: Mother Barrington, there is something that I do need to tell you. I'm not sure if it's going to help or hurt, but i do feel the need to tell you -- we were on our way home. ",
        "Amanda: To Port Charles? ",
        "Elizabeth: Malcolm felt so badly about the estrangement that he had established between you. ",
        "Amanda: My son was coming home? ",
        "Elizabeth: He was so proud of all of your charity and foundation work. As a matter of fact, he was in the process of establishing a European chapter of the Barrington foundation to parallel all of the nice works that you do here in Port Charles. ",
        "Amanda: Indeed. ",
        "Elizabeth: You can check it out yourself, Mother Barrington. I don't expect you to believe me. Your son loved you very much. It was just very difficult for him to show it -- that's all. ",
        "Amanda: Terence, will you take me home, please? ",
        "Alison: Nana, won't you stay with me? ",
        "Amanda: No, thank you, darling. There are so many things I have to do. I have to make the arrangements for the memorial service. ",
        "Alison: No, don't do that today. Please? Please? ",
        "Amanda: I love you, darling. And I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry for all of us. We'll talk later. ",
        "Alison: Thanks, Nana. ",
        "Alison: Was anything you just said true? ",

        "Lucy: Do you actually believe Elizabeth could be a vampire? ",
        "Rafe: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Lucy: What? ",
        "Rafe: Not the kind you're talking about. ",
        "Lucy: What other kind is there? ",
        "Rafe: Well, you see, Elizabeth is a human vampire, the kind that sucks the life out of everyone she comes in contact with, and I refuse to let Alison be one of them. ",
        "Lucy: All right. I'm in. What do you want me to do -- anything? ",
        "Rafe: No, no, you've been a great friend to Alison, so -- so just keep doing it, ok? ",
        "Lucy: Well, I will. Of course I will -- you know that -- but I have a feeling that Alison has everything she wants sitting right beside me here. She's not going to need me. All right, enough of that. Just -- just for the moment, I desperately need to know -- how did this happen? How did you come back to me? How -- what -- how did you get back here? What? Tell me. ",
        "Rafe: Ok. ",
        "Lucy: Ok. ",

        "Lucy: Well, look at you! I just told you I bought you the cutest -- never mind. And you're letting your head get filled up with this stuff. How many times have I told you do not blast this music into that beautiful brain of yours? It'll be warped forever. What is it, by the way? ",
