        "Shirley tells Darlita and Saul that Bill Spencer will not kill them with his own son here. Liam looks worried but says no he doesn't think Bill will do anything now. Steffy tells Wyatt that she does not have a good feeling about this. Bill grouses to Justin that he offered all kinds of help for Sally at his own expense but they all said no. He doesn't mind Liam being the good Boy Scout when it doesn't interfere with his plans but this is enough. He has lost his patience. Steffy calls Liam and tells him that he has to get out of there. Liam says he is fighting for a cause. He wishes Steffy would give him a little more support. He thinks he will be just fine though. He is inside and Bill just turned the power off so now they wait. Steffy tells Wyatt that Liam is losing his father and maybe even his own life all for Sally. Wyatt is stunned that Liam is so stubborn that both he and Bill are both trying to bluff each other. One of them will pay eventually. But he knows them both and thinks they will find a way to work this out. The crew tells Bill that all the explosives are in place yet there are people inside. Bill says it is still a go. They are not waiting another day. Bill calls Liam and asks if they can work this out. Liam says no. He is showing respect to the legacy and so should Bill. If Bill continues then he is going to do it with Liam inside. Liam tells Sally that he is going to stay. He believes in this; greed and power have their limits. This is her place and he will be damned if he sees it turn into a graveyard by one man. She and Liam both say any of them can leave if they want but she and Liam are going to stay until the end. Wyatt tells Steffy that he wishes he could tell her not to worry but he knows she will anyway. She says she knows Liam is going to see this through to the bitter end. She cannot stand around and wait for that. She has to go.",
        "The explosive foreman says they are ready but they could always just start with the back building that is not really part of the main building. Bill says do it. It will send a warning but not hurt anybody. When the small explosion goes off Liam says that is just his father trying to scare them. Sally tells Liam it is not worth it. She leaves with the rest of them, leaving only Liam. Then at the last possible second she stops. Liam tells her she should go but she hangs with him. Bill tells the foreman that it won't be long now. He thinks that jolt will send them running for their lives. Justin looks through his binoculars and calls Bill that they are all leaving, even Liam. Liam decides to go back in and Sally says she is not going to let him to do this alone. Justin looks again and this time cannot find Liam. The foreman tells Bill that they are about to make some noise. Justin tries to call Bill but no answer as he has his headphones on and the foreman hands him the equipment to pull the switch just as Steffy walks in and sees the building crumble. Bill has a happy face on; Justin does not. Bill says just like that; Skye is born. Then he checks his phone where Justin tells him do not do this; Liam and Sally are still in the building."

        "Darlita: [ Chuckles ] I don't like this. Maybe we should leave.",
        "Saul: Yeah, bill spencer wants to demolish this building. I doubt our little sit-in is gonna stop him.",
        "Shirley: He's not gonna kill us, not with his own son here! Right, sally? Bill's not that looney, is he?",
        "Sally: What do you think, liam? You know what your father's capable of.",
        "Liam: Yeah, I do. But he -- he wouldn'T.",
        "Bill: A freaking sit-in!",
        "Justin: And they're not budging. The crew says they refused to vacate the building.",
        "Bill: Whatever happened to protesting something that actually matters? It's an old, rundown relic that I'm putting out of its misery! I even offered to relocate sally and her band of idiots at my expense, but no! That's not good enough for my son.",
        "Justin: Okay, so what do you want to do?",
        "Bill: I'll tell you what I'm not gonna do. I'm not gonna be stopped. That building is being demo'd today!",
        "Steffy: Liam still hasn't text me back.",
        "Wyatt: I hope he comes to his senses and gets the hell out of that building.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, me, too. Liam's putting his life at risk.",
        "Wyatt: I know. This whole sit-in is ridiculous.",
        "Steffy: Wyatt, I don't have a good feeling about this.",
        "Bill: Liam's on my last nerve. I mean, I love my son. And part of me -- part of me even admires that he's a little boy scout rooting for the underdog.",
        "Justin: Yeah, well, I mean, as long as it doesn't get in your way.",
        "Bill: Exactly. And I'm losing my patience, justin. I mean, he knows how important this is to me and our family and the company.",
        "Justin: He seems pretty devoted to sally spectra.",
        "Bill: Well, it's misplaced devotion. And sooner rather than later, it's gonna come back to bite him in the ass.",
        "Steffy: I don't know how much more of this I can take.",
        "Wyatt: Well, try him again. Maybe he'll pick up.",
        "[ Cellphone rings ]",
        "Liam: Hey. I was just about to text you back.",
        "Steffy: Please tell me you're not going through with this.",
        "Liam: Uh, well, I'm here now. Uh, the place is already wired with explosives, and my dad just cut the power, so... [ Snaps fingers ] ...Fun.",
        "Steffy: Liam, this is crazy. You got to get out of there.",
        "Liam: I'm fighting for a cause, steffy.",
        "Steffy: Sally spectra?",
        "Liam: I know you don't want to hear it, but yes.",
        "Steffy: Please just don't do this, liam.",
        "Liam: You know, I wish you felt a little more supportive of me, maybe even proud of me.",
        "Steffy: I just don't have a good feeling about this, okay? Can you please just get out of there? Please?",
        "Liam: I'm sorry, steffy. I-I know you're worried, but i promise you everything is gonna be just fine, okay? I love you. I'll call you later.",
        "Steffy: Liam. Li-liam?",
        "Steffy: Liam is risking his relationship with his father and maybe his life all for sally spectra.",
        "Wyatt: How long is he planning on doing this sit-in demonstration thing?",
        "Steffy: I don't know. As long as it takes. I don't think he's planning on leaving.",
        "Wyatt: You said dad turned the power off on the building, though, right?",
        "Steffy: Yeah. And the building's already wired with explosives.",
        "Wyatt: And that wasn't enough to scare him out of there?",
        "Steffy: I think liam is calling bill's bluff.",
        "Wyatt: [ Chuckling ] Oh, my god. That's -- that's what dad's trying to do right now, too. He's trying to call liam's bluff.",
        "Steffy: But there's no way bill's gonna blow up the building with liam inside.",
        "Wyatt: No, of course not. But they're both trying to see who's gonna flinch first. Dad's just trying to get liam to back down from his little protest.",
        "Steffy: I know your father, and he does not back down.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, well, he can be very stubborn.",
        "Steffy: So can liam. That's why I'm so afraid.",
        "Wyatt: But this is his son we're talking about here. Dad's not gonna put liam's life in danger.",
        "Steffy: Bill is preparing to level the building as we speak. Liam's already in jeopardy.",
        "Wyatt: One of them will cave eventually. They'll have to. [ Scoffs ] And we'll all have a good laugh about this at thanksgiving.",
        "Steffy: I wish I had your optimism.",
        "Wyatt: I know my father and my brother. They're gonna find a way to work this out. Okay, we finished our check on the explosives. The buildings are rigged. Ready to come down.",
        "Bill: My son and his friends are still in there. You want me to 86 the whole operation?",
        "Bill: Hell no. No, no, no. We are doing this today.",
        "[ Cellphone rings ]",
        "Saul: This is all gonna be fine.",
        "Liam: Hey, guys. It's my pop. Hello.",
        "Bill: Son, it's your father. Can we work this out?",
        "Liam: Sure, but spectra fashions stays put or no deal.",
        "Bill: Liam, come on. I have offered to relocate them at my own expense. They're gonna be in a much better building.",
        "Liam: Oh, my god, you don't get it. Dad, it's the principle. You understand? You have bullied spectra for far too long, and I'm not gonna let you level what is essentially their home.",
        "Bill: Liam, it is an old, dilapidated mess. It's falling apart!",
        "Liam: There's history here. You understand that? It's a legacy. Now, that may mean nothing to you, but it's everything to them. We're staying, okay? We're staying. And if you're determined to bring down this building, I hope you're prepared to do it with me inside.",
        "Bill: [ Sighs ]",
        "Sally: Bill's not backing down, is he?",
        "Liam: No, but neither are we.",
        "Shirley: Oh, dear lord. What have we gotten ourselves into?",
        "Sally: Grams, I need you to stay calm.",
        "Shirley: I'm trying to, sally girl, but my whole life is flashing in front of my eyes.",
        "Darlita: I really don't want to go out this way, you guys. I-I love you, but there's still a whole bunch I want to do with my life.",
        "Saul: If I'm gonna die today, I should probably delete my internet search history.",
        "Sally: Okay, guys, stop it, all of you, okay? We're not gonna die here.",
        "Liam: You know, it's fine if you want to go. It really is. Any of you can leave at any time. For what it's worth, I think I'm gonna stay 'cause I believe in this. I believe in what we're doing here. I believe in making this point peacefully. I guarantee you, you are not the first casualties of my father's ambition, and you won't be the last if we don't teach him this lesson that greed and power have limits, that destroying people's lives is not a legitimate business model. This is your legacy. This is your history. And I'll be damned if I'm gonna see it turned into a graveyard for the sake of one man's ego. Not today.",
        "Sally: You guys can leave if you're scared. I'm scared, too. But honestly, I am more afraid of what happens if we do not stand up to bill spencer, so i am staying. Till the end.",
        "Steffy: What if one of the explosives accidentally goes off, hmm?",
        "Wyatt: That's not gonna happen, all right? Even if it did, it would barely do any structural damage, I'm guessing.",
        "Steffy: That doesn't comfort me.",
        "Wyatt: What -- what do you want me to do? You want me to call dad, tell him to back down?",
        "Steffy: Do you think he would listen to you?",
        "Wyatt: Probably not.",
        "Steffy: Well, what do I do? I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do.",
        "Wyatt: I don't know, but i can't -- I can't tell you not to worry because I know you, steffy. You're just gonna worry anyway.",
        "Steffy: Just...liam and your father were finally getting along. What? Now he's just gonna choose this building over his own son?",
        "Wyatt: Family's always been first with dad. But lately he's been considering this building a part of the family.",
        "Steffy: I know liam, and he's not gonna give up. He's gonna see this through to the bitter end. I just -- I can't sit here and do nothing about this. I got to go. I-I got to go. I have a gut feeling that something bad is gonna happen.",
        "[ Door closes ] You want me to get the cops over here? Have the protestors arrested?",
        "Justin: Technically they are trespassing.",
        "Bill: No. No, there's got to be a better way to do this. Well, like I said, we can always reschedule.",
        "Bill: [ Scoffs ] That's not gonna happen. That building will be dirt by the end of the day.",
        "Justin: Okay, but we got to be careful, make sure liam gets out safely.",
        "Bill: Well, of course, justin. That goes without saying. Okay, well, we'll be on standby. You let us know what you decide. Oh, hey, we could get started on the out building. It's not connected to the main structure.",
        "Bill: The warehouse. How far away is that again? Out back ways, like 200 feet or so.",
        "Bill: Blow it up. No one will get hurt, but it'll be enough to scare those squatters out of my damn building. You keep an eye on the back door. Let me know when they come running out.",
        "Justin: Sure thing.",
        "Bill: Give them a jolt. Copy that.",

        "Shirley: It's been awfully quiet.",
        "Darlita: Is that a good thing or a bad thing?",
        "Liam: I wouldn't get your hopes up.",
        "Sally: Yeah, I'm with liam on this one. I don't think it's time to start celebrating yet.",
        "Saul: Yeah, it's dead silent out there. I bet they all gave up and went home.",
        "Darlita: So, it worked. We did it.",
