        "Liam tells Ivy that he is grateful that she is dropping the restraining order but .she gets it that she can not tell him how she feels that she still loves him. There have only been two, both Spencers and she loved him first. Nicole tells Maya that nothing happened and they can talk this over tomorrow. Zende seemed to think he wanted something and so did she, then it just stopped. Sasha tells Zende that he is an incredible man and Nicole should thank her lucky stars. He has been very supportive throughout all of this, but he's not a saint. The next few months will not be easy for either one of them. She offers to be there for him if he needs someone to talk to. Julius tells Vivienne that he told Nicole she was going to regret being a surrogate and now she is stuck. He blames Maya for that. Wyatt tells Steffy that he loves Ivy so do not say anything bad against her. He is even thinking of marriage. Ivy says she loves Wyatt and she is very happy with him but before him was Liam. He let her go for Steffy and now she is thinking that she should not have done that.",
        "Sasha drops by the motel to see Vivienne but she is leaving for the store. Nicole tells Maya that everybody has a right to their feelings and at least Zende did not shut down or complain. Zende comes in and says he is sorry. He wanted tonight to be very special for them and and he is sorry for the way he acted. He said it all caught him off guard and it was not her, he loves her. She says she is pregnant and even though she did not want it to change things, it has. Ivy comes in and tells Steffy she does not have to hide. She had a talk with Liam and she just dropped the restraining order. She has wasted enough time feeling that way. Julius ignores Sasha then tells her this is not her home. She had a great time and hooked up with Nicole but now it is time to go home. She repeats again that she likes it here and she is not going home. Wyatt tells Ivy that he is proud of her for finally realizing and admitting it. Steffy agrees, she is engaged to Liam and she does not want any animosity between them. Liam laments that it is time for Ivy to move on. She did the right thing by dropping the restraining order. She says she did not expect all these feelings to come up but she does not want to talk about Steffy. She has always known she still loved Liam. He says he will always care about her. She says she is trying to show him who she is and that is why she dropped the RO because he asked her to. Liam makes her want to be a better person. She needs him in her life. She can not bite her tongue even if it is more convenient. She only wants to tell the truth. So there could still be a chance for them before it is too late. Sasha tells Julius that he can not tell her what to do. He says if she stays it will only complicate matters. If she wants to come back, do not overstay her welcome. She says she knows she just got here but this is what she wants, to be part of this big city with his family. It is full of opportunities. Nicole could not even get a date back home and now she is dating a Forrester. Julius tells her to stay away from Zende. She calls him Mr. Avant enough times that it irritates him and finally she says okay she will call him what he really is \u0096 Daddy."

        "Liam: Ivy, I'm -- I'm so grateful you're dropping the restraining order, but you can't...",
        "Ivy: What? I-I can't kiss you?",
        "Liam: No.",
        "Ivy: I can't tell you how I feel? I can't tell you that I miss you?",
        "Liam: [Sighs]",
        "Ivy: Look, I know -- I know that you probably think I've been a little all over the place the last few months, and you probably think that this is just a part of that, but... look, you have to remember, I've only been in love with two people in my entire life, and both of them were Spencers. And you were the first.",
        "Steffy: [Sighs]",
        "Wyatt: You heard anything from Liam yet?",
        "Steffy: No, not yet. Hey, can you, uh, help me carry these down to the car?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. Sure. Um... do you think Liam will get through to Ivy, though?",
        "Steffy: I love him for trying, but I don't think he has any pull with Ivy anymore.",
        "Maya: Don't tell me you're not upset. I can see that you are.",
        "Nicole: I'm tired. [Voice breaking] Can we talk about this tomorrow?",
        "Maya: Something happened with Zende. Were you up in his room?",
        "Nicole: Nothing happened.",
        "Maya: Nicole, you can talk to me.",
        "Nicole: I'm telling you the truth, Maya. Zende wanted something to happen, and I thought for a second that I did, too. But then he was kissing me, and as he got to my stomach... he just stopped.",
        "Maya: Because of the pregnancy.",
        "Sasha: You're an incredible man, Zende.",
        "Zende: Not feeling so incredible right now.",
        "Sasha: Because Nicole's unhappy with you?",
        "Zende: She has a right to be.",
        "Sasha: No, she should be thanking her lucky stars for a man like you. I don't know what happened downstairs, but I know it was a misunderstanding. You have been more patient and understanding about this whole situation than any guy could be.",
        "Julius: We should have stayed at the house.",
        "Vivienne: Maya's gonna find out what's wrong.",
        "Julius: Well, isn't it obvious? I mean, Zende almost chased Nicole through the living room! Trust me, they're having problems.",
        "Vivienne: Problems that she doesn't want to discuss with us.",
        "Julius: It ain't gonna help to discuss them with Maya.",
        "Vivienne: They're sisters.",
        "Julius: I told Nicole! I said, \"you're gonna regret being a surrogate.\" But we know Maya. No, she guilted her into doing this, and now look. Now Nicole is stuck.",
        "Maya: This is what we were all afraid of -- the pregnancy causing problems for you and Zende.",
        "Nicole: Look, his girlfriend is carrying somebody else's baby. I understand why it's difficult for him. He wants us to be a normal couple, do things normal couples do.",
        "Maya: And he's frustrated.",
        "Nicole: That is exactly the word I would use.",
        "Sasha: Nicole has to realize how hard this is on you.",
        "Zende: I'm sure she does.",
        "Sasha: And don't get me wrong. I completely respect her wanting to be Maya's surrogate.",
        "Zende: Yeah. I do, too.",
        "Sasha: Yeah, I know you do. You've been amazing at handling all of this. But, Zende, you're not a saint. You know, the next nine months aren't gonna be a breeze for either of you.",
        "Zende: No. They won't.",
        "Sasha: And everybody is downstairs worried about Nic. Maya, Rick, her parents. But who's worried about you? You know, um, if you need someone to talk to, I'm here.",
        "Steffy: You can't always count on people to do the right thing.",
        "Wyatt: I believe Ivy will. She's upset right now, but she'll come around. I believe in her, okay? And I love her.",
        "Steffy: Really?",
        "Wyatt: Yes. So don't say anything bad about her right now.",
        "Steffy: Wow. Are you... are you serious?",
        "Wyatt: I am. Yeah. I can see myself marrying her.",
        "Liam: Well, I'm glad you can be honest about how you're feeling.",
        "Ivy: I have to be. Liam, what happened could have been it for me, so I don't want to leave things unsaid anymore.",
        "Liam: Yeah. But you're involved with my brother.",
        "Ivy: I know that. And I love Wyatt. I do. I'm very happy with him. But before I was happy with him, I was happy with you, and I was planning an entire future with you. And I let that go when you left me for Steffy. But now... now I'm -- I'm thinking maybe I shouldn't have done that.",
        "Vivienne: Oh, okay, I'm gonna run to the store. Do me a favor -- do not call Nicole while I'm gone.",
        "Julius: I won't.",
        "Vivienne: Zende, neither.",
        "Julius: All right.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Vivienne: Oh. Perfect timing. You're gonna have company while I'm gone.",
        "Sasha: Hi!",
        "Vivienne: Sasha! Oh! I'm running to the store. Would you like anything?",
        "Sasha: No. Nothing.",
        "Vivienne: Okay.",
        "Sasha: But thank you for asking. You're always so sweet to me.",
        "Vivienne: Well, it's my pleasure. Oh! Did you speak to Nicole?",
        "Sasha: No. Did you?",
        "Vivienne: Briefly, but she didn't feel like talking.",
        "Sasha: Yeah, she seemed pretty wound up.",
        "Julius: I'm telling you, Nicole is asking too much of Zende. It's going to ruin their relationship.",
        "Vivienne: Okay. I'm going.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Nicole: I made my own choice, and I am so proud to be your surrogate. If Zende can't handle that, that is not your fault.",
        "Maya: It's not your fault, either. I'm sorry.",
        "Nicole: Everybody has a right to their feelings. Zende reacted. He didn't complain. He -- he didn't shut down. He wanted to talk about it. I'm the one who walked out.",
        "Maya: Because you were hurt?",
        "Nicole: I didn't know what to say. I still don't.",
        "Zende: It's okay. I think I'm the one who should be doing the talking, anyway.",
        "Maya: I'll let you do that.",
        "Zende: You're not gonna run off again, are you?",
        "Nicole: Depends what you have to say.",
        "Zende: I'm sorry, Nicole. I really wanted tonight to be special for us. And I blew it. I feel terrible about the way I reacted.",
        "Steffy: Ivy's really scared of me. What happened to her was horrific. Anybody would be freaked out. I just wish she didn't think I was a horrible person.",
        "Wyatt: [Sighs] Okay. Well, I tried to convince her that you're not like that, okay?",
        "Steffy: Oh, really?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Steffy: And what am I like?",
        "Wyatt: Well, you're not a violent psychopath.",
        "Steffy: Okay, okay. Not exactly glowing praise, but I'll take it.",
        "Wyatt: Okay, fine. Uh, I think you're dynamic, ambitious, thoughtful. And I think my mom is crazy about you.",
        "Steffy: Oh, boy. I don't know if that's a good thing. [Laughs]",
        "Wyatt: [Laughing] Maybe not.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Steffy: I'm all packed up, so you don't have to call lieutenant baker.",
        "Ivy: I've already made the call.",
        "Steffy: What?!",
        "Liam: Ju-- just listen.",
        "Ivy: There's no more restraining order, Steffy. Liam and I had a really honest conversation, and straight after, I called lieutenant baker and I had the restraining order dropped.",
        "Steffy: Oh, my God. So...wait. So I won't be arrested if I'm around you?",
        "Ivy: No.",
        "Steffy: So it's done?",
        "Ivy: Look, if you need me to do anything else, I can take care of it in the morning.",
        "Wyatt: I knew you'd come around. I'm proud of you.",
        "Ivy: Yeah. It was the right thing to do, I think.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles]",
        "Steffy: It's really over? It's all right for us to be in the same -- same room? And I'm not just talking about legally. You don't feel like I'm a danger to you?",
        "Ivy: I think I've wasted enough time feeling threatened by you.",
        "Steffy: Oh, my God. Ivy, Ivy, thank you so much. I can't imagine what you've gone through, but I am so, so grateful that -- that you're doing this.",
        "Ivy: Yeah. I kind of have a new perspective on things. I'm ready for a fresh start.",
        "Steffy: Oh, my God.",
        "Zende: Maybe an apology isn't enough.",
        "Nicole: I owe you one, too.",
        "Zende: I don't blame you for running off.",
        "Nicole: We knew this wouldn't be easy. I just didn't expect it to be so hard to talk about.",
        "Zende: I think we need to.",
        "Nicole: Me, too.",
        "Zende: Look, Nicole, I still respect your decision. I don't want you to feel that my feelings are changing because of it.",
        "Nicole: And I don't want you to feel bad for having a hard time with it.",
        "Zende: Just caught me off guard. I don't -- I don't know why I reacted like that. But it's not you. I need you to know that. I love you. I want to hold you. I want to wake up next to you.",
        "Nicole: I want that, too. But it's not that simple anymore. I am pregnant. And even though I didn't want it to change things, it has.",
        "Zende: Not everything.",
        "Sasha: You know, uh, it's polite to talk to your guest.",
        "Julius: It's polite to call before you drop by.",
        "Sasha: Well, I knew aunt Viv wouldn't mind. Yeah, being out here with her in L.A. And the rest of the family, well, it's really making this place feel like home.",
        "Julius: Yes. But it's not your home, Sasha. It's time for you to get back to real life.",
        "Sasha: This is real life for Maya and Nicole.",
        "Julius: Yes. For Maya and Nicole, it is. But for you, it's not. Listen, you've had a great time. You got a chance to hook up with Nicole. But now it's time for you to go home.",
        "Sasha: I thought I made myself clear. I'm not leaving. I like it here, Mr. Avant. Yeah, los Angeles really suits me. I think if I stick around, I can really come out of my shell and finally become the person I was meant to be.",
        "Steffy: A fresh start sounds good to me.",
        "Ivy: I think I've just been dealing with a lot of emotions that I don't quite understand. I've been pushing them down, haven't been facing them, you know, and I don't want to do that anymore.",
        "Liam: Yeah, well, Steffy never meant to hurt you.",
        "Wyatt: And I'm proud of you for realizing that.",
        "Ivy: Thank you, Wyatt. Thanks for standing by my side even though I've been making a lot of mistakes.",
        "Steffy: No, no. You weren't the only one who made mistakes. I made mistakes, too. It was terrible what you've been through, and I really am grateful that you're okay. I know our relationship has been difficult since I got back to L.A., All the suspicion and resentment, but hey, you're with Wyatt and I'm engaged to Liam. We have this exciting future ahead of us. I don't -- I don't want any animosity between us at all.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, me either. There is one thing I want from you, Steffy.",
        "Steffy: Friendship?",
        "[Both laugh]",
        "Steffy: Because honestly, I-I would really like that.",
        "Liam: Um, can I talk to you alone for a second?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. Sure.",
        "Steffy: I think this is the fresh start we were talking about.",
        "Ivy: Yeah. [Sighs]",
        "Liam: Okay. Time to move on. Steffy's right. You and Wyatt have a great future ahead of you.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, but... Liam, so could we.",
        "[Insects chirping]",
        "Liam: You did the right thing, dropping the restraining order against Steffy. I know she's -- she's very grateful.",
        "Ivy: Liam, I don't -- I don't want to talk about Steffy right now.",
        "Liam: Yeah.",
        "Ivy: [Sighs] Look, I didn't expect all of these feelings to come up. If I'm being honest, I'm not completely surprised that they have because I know that, deep down, I've -- I've always loved you. I guess that's why when you let me get fired, I was so angry because I just kept trying to ignore the way I was actually feeling.",
        "Liam: I will always care about you, especially after what you did today.",
        "Ivy: Liam... I ended that restraining order today for one reason. It's because you asked me to. Look, I'm just -- I'm trying to show you who I am, who I've always been. I know that there's only one woman around here who shares the exact same qualities that you do, the exact same sense of compassion and wisdom. You -- you make me want to be a better person. I want you in my life. I need you in my life. I can't imagine my life without you in it. And I know -- I know that right now I really shouldn't be saying that, but, I mean, why am I -- why am I supposed to bite my tongue just because the way I'm feeling is -- is inconvenient? I've done that so much. That's how I've always lived my life, and I don't have time for that anymore. Now I only have time for the truth. And look, the way I feel for Wyatt, it's never eclipsed how I felt for you. So, I mean, what if that means there's still a chance for us? Why don't we see if we can make this work? Why don't we give ourselves a chance before it's too late?",
        "Zende: We will figure this out if we focus on each other and -- and just shut out everything else.",
        "Nicole: We won't let anyone or anything come between us.",
        "Sasha: You can't tell me what to do. I've said it before. If I want to stay here, I will.",
        "Julius: Not with my family.",
        "Sasha: I don't think they would turn me away.",
        "Julius: Listen, Sasha, Nicole is going through a great deal right now, and with you staying here, it's only gonna complicate matters.",
        "Sasha: For you.",
        "Julius: Look, you've had a great time, right? I mean, you got a chance to tour Forrester creations, you've seen where Maya lives. You've had a great time, haven't you?",
        "Sasha: More than I can say.",
        "Julius: So, if you want to be invited back, you don't want to overstay your welcome.",
        "Sasha: But I like it here! It's great weather and a cool city. There's lots of exciting, beautiful people to meet. I know I just got here, but I'm sold. This is what I want.",
        "Julius: Wait a minute. W-what is it that you want?",
        "Sasha: To be a part of this. And now I know I think it's gonna take awhile, but --",
        "Julius: Listen, if you want to experience a big city, all you got to do is move to Chicago. But there's no place for you here!",
        "Sasha: No, I disagree! L.A. Is full of opportunity! Just look at Maya and Nicole! Maya, of course, for being a famous supermodel. She's an international celebrity. But Nicole? She couldn't even get a date back home, and now she's dating a Forrester! He's sexy and sensitive. He'd have to be to be okay with his girl playing incubator to Rick and Maya's baby. A guy like that could have any girl he wanted.",
        "Julius: Sasha. Leave Zende alone. Stay away from him.",
        "Sasha: Look, there you go again bossing me around! Who do you think you are, Mr. Avant?!",
        "Julius: Watch the way you talk to me!",
        "Sasha: Talk to you like what, Mr. Avant?",
        "Julius: You watch your tone.",
        "Sasha: Don't like that, Mr. Avant? Should I call you something else? Do you want me to call you what you really are? Daddy? Mr. Avant?!",
        "Julius: Watch the way you talk to me!"
