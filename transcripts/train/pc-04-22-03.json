        "The band members celebrate the success of their first gig without Stephen Clay. Ricky appoints himself leader, and Jack's ideas on how to promote the band land him the position of manager. Ricky witnesses a kiss between Jamal and a stunned Casey. Joshua turns down Elizabeth's offer to become a vampire again in exchange for Alison's safe return. When Joshua orders Frank to kill Elizabeth, Ian opens the way to the secret room, and she ducks inside. Rafe tells Caleb about Joshua's collage of photos. Unwilling to let his Olivia suffer again, Caleb reveals a way for Rafe to leave the cell. Following Caleb's directions, Rafe locates the keys to the two cells, only to be interrupted by Bruno. Recognizing him as the vampire who imprisoned Alison, Rafe attacks. When Frank doesn't heed Ian's warning to back off, Ian jabs a long, sharp crystal into his chest. Caleb makes a friendly gesture to a cold Alison by letting her wear his coat. Joshua prevails against Lucy, who has no power against the vampire. Sensing something wrong at the villa, Joshua leaves a confused Lucy alive. Rafe frees Alison and Caleb, but Caleb knocks him out and takes the keys to Olivia's cell."

        "Casey: Different like good different, though, right?",
        "Reese: I'm not sure. I'm still getting used to being, you know, normal.",
        "Caz: Trust me, reese, you will never be normal. It did take quite some guts to get up there and play solo, so big props to that. How about that one?",
        "Ricky: Hey, hey, hey, guys? Check it out, when you guys are done flossing each other, why don't you spread a little love over here.",
        "Reese: Oh --",
        "ricky: No, no, no. Listen up. Listen up. That guy over there just offered us a permanent gig to play at this place.",

        "Ricky: Our so-called manager can go straight to hell.",
        "Reese: Yeah!",
        "Joshua: Seems like we've got quite a situation here. You and I, frank, against -- whose side are you on, elizabeth?",
        "Elizabeth: My own.",
        "Joshua: That's my girl.",
        "Ian: We don't want any trouble.",
        "Lucy: The hell we don'T. What are you talking about?",
        "Ian: As I said, we just want to take alison back home.",
        "Joshua: And what if I told you alison already is home?",
        "Ian: That's not acceptable.",
        "Joshua: Not very good odds, thornhart.",

        "Elizabeth: Oh, just stop it! You're all so disgusting! I just had it up to here with all of you! Vampires and slayers and werewolves -- I think you're just a bunch of losers, as far as I'm concerned.",
        "Joshua: Stay out of this, elizabeth!",
        "Elizabeth: You can all just go bite yoseself and bleed to death for all I care! This is between you and me, joshua. You can have anything you want from me as long as you just tell me where the hell my daughter is.",
        "Joshua: You have got to be joking.",
        "Rafe: Why didn't joshua kill you?",
        "Caleb: You disappointed?",
        "Rafe: No. I'm just curious.",
        "Caleb: His satisfaction comes from watching us suffer. It amuses him to see me like this. Of course, thanks to you and your friends, i like this.",
        "Rafe: Ok, you know what? Can you stop whining about your lack of fangs and just think for a minute? What does he really want?",
        "Caleb: He worked for me, rafe. We didn't take a lot of time to talk about his hopes and his dreams. He's on a power trip, that's all.",
        "Rafe: No. He has a bigger plan in mind.",
        "Caleb: Yeah? What?",
        "Rafe: Look, he's collected a bunch of photographs. They're -- he made a collage out of them, basically. They're candid photos of livvie and alison. It's basically a shrine.",
        "Caleb: When wery you planning on telling me this little piece of information?",
        "Alison: Rafe?",
        "Rafe: I thought you were sleeping.",
        "Alison: No, I'm not. Joshua has been taking pictures of me?",
        "Rafe: Ok.",
        "Alison: Oh, my god. That pig.",
        "Rafe: Alison --",
        "alison: I swear, if he ever even lays one hand on me --",
        "rafe: Ok -- it'll be ok.",
        "Alison: I don't want him around --",
        "rafe: Ok --",
        "alison: At all.",
        "Rafe: All right, all right.",
        "Livvie: What are you guys yelling about?",
        "Alison: Joshua has been taking pictures of you and me. He's been stalking us. Rafe, I would rather sit in this hole and rot here forever than let that pig --",
        "rafe: He will be a dead man before I let that happen, all right?",
        "Alison: I can't do this. I don't want to do this anymore. I can'T. It's too much.",
        "Livvie: We have to find a way out of here.",
        "Rafe: And you know how. Now, if you created this system to take away my powers, you can tell me a way to override it.",
        "Caleb: I can't do that.",
        "Rafe: Yes, you can! Look, if we rot in this hellhole, it's going to be all your fault. Now, I can get us out of here, but not without your help. [Captioning made possible a abc, inc.]",
        "Ian: Elizabeth, don'T.",
        "Elizabeth: I want my daughter back. I will pay the price. Anything he wants.",
        "Joshua: Sweetheart, there's nothing you have that I want.",
        "Elizabeth: But there is. You can turn me again. Think about it, joshua. We had some laughs together as vampires, remember? You'd feed on me, I'd feed on you, a little nookie in between. I left you with a smile on your face more than once.",
        "Frank: Good god, doesn't she ever shut up?",
        "Joshua: Do you know what the sad truth is? When we were fooling around before, I wasn't about to turn yo I was about to kill you. And this miserable plea -- it's endearing. I'm almost tempted to save your life -- almost. Frank, kill her.",
        "Ian: What kind of a coward are you?",
        "Shshua: And then you and I, frank, can take care of this accidental vampire.",
        "Lucy: You're forgetting about me, you know, joshua.",
        "Joshua: Yeah. From what I hear, you had your chance to help alison. You weren't quite up to the task, slayer.",
        "Lucy: Frank! No! Don't hurt her! Don't hurt her.",
        "Frank: I'm sorry, lucy, I don't take orders from you.",
        "Ian: I won't let you do this!",
        "Lucy: Frank! Ian? I've got joshua!",
        "Ian: Lucy, no!",
        "Alison: Caleb? Listen to him, please.",
        "Rafe: I'm trying to help all of us.",
        "Caleb: Of course you are. You'd never just do this for yourself.",
        "Livvie: You can't blame caleb for not trusting him. I mean, after all the pain I was in, I'm sure if there were a way out of here, he would ha l let me out and not suffer. Right?",
        "Alison: Well, that is a good question, caleb. I mean, livv was in pretty bad shape.",
        "Caleb: We are finding a way out of here.",
        "Rafe: Oh, yeah? How? How? What are we going to do? We just going to wait for, what, livvie to just lose so much weight that she's going to be able to fit through the bars? Is that going to work, huh? What she said is right, right? You don't trust me?",
        "Caleb: Then again, what else is new?",
        "Rafe: I'll tell you what, all of us being locked in here together -- that's new. All right? But you can do whatever you want. But unless you come up with a better plan, I am the only game in town!",
        "Caleb: Oh, then I'm finding the alternative.",
        "Rafe: Ok. You go ahead and do that. But I'll tell you what, you better hurry because the thrill of torturing us is going to wear pretty thin, and that's when joshua's going to come in here and kill us both. Now, as much as I hate to admit it, our lives are in your hands.",
        "Livvie: Once this feeding s worn off, I'm going to be in pain again, aren't I?",
        "Caleb: Yes. What do you want from me?",
        "Rafe: I want you to help me get my powers back so I can get o out of here.",
        "Caleb: All of us? All of us? Even knowing the inevitable will happen when olivia and I are together again?",
        "Rafe: I don't have much of a choice, do I? So I'll take a leap of faith if you will.",
        "Livvie: Caleb, is there a way out of here? Please tell me there is a way.",
        "Caleb: Rafe is not going to let us be together. You know that.",
        "Livvie: I can't go through that again.",
        "Alison: I'm sorry.",
        "Rafe: Why? What for?",
        "Alison: For before -- the way I acted about joshua. I shouldn't let him get to me.",
        "Rafe: No, no, no, no. We're all losing it a little bit. It's ok.",
        "Alison: What do you think the pictures mean? Whwhat do you think that he wants with us?",
        "Rafe: I don't know. But I promise you this -- when I get out of here, I'm going to find out. Whatever it is, I'm going to put an end to it, all right?",
        "Caleb: Rafe? In the main room of the villa, there's an antique desk. The keys for these cells are in the drawer on the right-hand side under a false bottom.",
        "Rafe: Good. That's great. Anything else you want to share with me, like how I get out of here?",
        "Caleb: Patience. Olivia? Go ahead and try one of your cheap tricks now.",
        "Alison: My god, rafe.",
        "Caz: So, how much does this gig pay?",
        "Ricky: A hell of a lot more than we've been making ever since joshua's been out there taking care of nobody but himself.",
        "Reese: You can say that again. So, are we going to elect a leader for this crew?",
        "Ricky: It's obvious. I'm the lead singer.",
        "Reese: What --",
        "ricky: You're lead guitar, and caz -- well, caz just wants toick up chicks.",
        "Caz: It's true. It's true.",
        "Ricky: All right, all right, all right. So let's get comfortable here because we got some plans to make.",
        "Caz: I thought we was just going to make music.",
        "Casey: Oh, see, now that's why you're the chick magnet and ricky here is the brains.",
        "Ricky: Uh-huh. Thank you, casey. Now, see, we're going to do what joshua talked about doing but never put into motion. We are going to set off this band by using \"the music\" special.",
        "Jamal: Wait, wait, wait. I thought the whole hook for that was because you were vampires.",
        "Casey: Right.",
        "Jamal: How you going to slide around that?",
        "Caz: Yeah, man, because I'm not going to that trip again.",
        "Ricky: Look, we got a real shot here, ok? And with or without the invisible stephen clay, I'm not letting it slip through our fingers.",
        "Jack: Now all you need is a gimmick.",
        "Casey: No, no, no, I got one. I mean, you guys already have this whole vampire rumor thing going on, right? Why not just create the mystique?",
        "Jamal: Yeah, yeah, nobody actually really believes it. Come on, but they like, you know, the idea of it.",
        "Casey: Yeah, you just play the whole goth thing to the max, and then just fake out on them.",
        "Ricky: Wait. So we pretend we're real vampires?",
        "Caz: Works for me.",
        "Jamal: Yo.",
        "Frank: This is the way you wanted it, ian.",
        "Ian: This is the last thing I wanted -- you doing the dirty work for joshua.",
        "Frank: Whatever it takes.",
        "Ian: You're quite a street fighter, but that's not going to help you here.",
        "Frank: We'll see about that.",
        "Ian: Don't do it. You don't know what I'm capable of. You don't know the strength I have.",
        "Frank: Your strength means nothing without a killer instinct. That's where I have you dead to rights.",
        "[Ian screams]",
        "Caleb: Hey? Hey? You want my jacket? Here. You're cold.",
        "Alison: You know, you made all th h happen. Your need for -- it's all very ugly and evil.",
        "Caleb: Shh.",
        "Livvie: Willafe be able to get us out of here?",
        "Caleb: I don't know. We'll have to see how this all turns out.",
        "Livvie: I should have stayed in the villa like you asked me to. If only I would have trusted you and waited --",
        "caleb: Hey --",
        "livvie: I just got scared.",
        "Caleb: Don't you do that to yourself. This is about survival. Staying alive till we can be together -- that's all that matters now. Ok?",
        "Livvie: Ok.",
        "Caleb: Ok.",
        "Bruno: How did you get out?",
        "Rafe: Hey. I know you. You're the vampire who threw alison into her cell, right? You let joshua terroze an innocent, beautiful woman. That's great.",
        "Bruno: You wait a minute.",
        "Rafe: No. There will be no more waiting. It es here.",
        "Rafe: Looking for me?",
        "Joshua: Is that a coat hanger? Is that the best you could do? It's not exactly up to your standards, is it, slayer?",
        "Lucy: It's about all you're worth, vampire.",
        "Joshua: Now, listen, why don't we both just take a breath and go on about our lives and we'll just call it a draw.",
        "Lucy: A draw? You really are a coward, aren't you?",
        "Joshua: No. I'm not. I'm just a little obsessive-compulsive. I don't like to get my hands dirty.",
        "Lucy: Aw. Poor baby. Well, you're just going to have to get over your obsessive-compulsive self, aren't you?",
        "Joshua: Now, I wouldn't do that.",
        "Lucy: Say your prayers.",
        "Joshua: I don't pray.",
        "[Hanger falls on floor]",
        "Lucy: You're not supposed to be able to do that.",
        "Joshua: No? Seems to me I can do anything I want.",
        "Lucy: I don't understand. I don't --",
        "joshua: Now, what do you suppose I'm going to do with a slayer who's lost her mojo?",
        "casey: So, what do you guys think of my idea, huh? You dig it?",
        "Ricky: All right, all right, look, if we're going to fake our way through this, we better have the music down solid --",
        "caz: Oh, yeah.",
        "Ricky: All right? Because that's going to make the difference in the end.",
        "Jack: If it was me, I would tone down the whole goth thing.",
        "Ricky: What do you know about music?",
        "Jack: Absolutely nothing. But what I do know is how to get someone to buy something they're not sure they want.",
        "Casey: Oh, you mean run a con, don't you?",
        "Jack: Everything's a con. You guys already have the whole vampire thing going for you. Now, you don't need to throw it in people's faces. It's not halloween where you have to dress up in a costume to get people to notice you.",
        "Jamal: Ah. I got -- I like this angle. Now, tell us more about this idea of yours.",
        "Jack: Well, dress in normal, cool clothes like you don't need to make a statement. And when people ask you who you are, where you're from, give them a bunch of different answers. But if they mention the v word, you look at them, you smile, and you say, \"no comment.\"",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Jamal: Yeah!",
        "Ricky: So we play up this whole mystery thing?",
        "Caz: Oh, I'm feeling this. I'm feeling it.",
        "Ricky: All right, all right. I like it, too. I like it. So, jack, you ever manage a band?",
        "Jack: Sure.",
        "Jamal: What? Get out -- no, no, he hasn'T. Since when?",
        "Jack: Since now.",
        "Jamal: Ooh.",
        "Casey: Ooh.",
        "Jack: I'll manage you guys -- unless you want to wait for joshua to rise up out of the coffin. Your choice.",
        "Ricky: All right. Well, we'll think about it. What do you say?",
        "Caz: Jack, I'm with it.",
        "Jack: All right, guys.",
        "Caz: Good show.",
        "Jack: I'll take you to the promised land, baby.",
        "Reese: So, did I remember to thank you for everything tonight?",
        "Jack: Yeah. It looks like I'm going to be managing your band. But you owow what? I don't think a guy can be thanked too many times in one night.",
        "Reese: No, I mean properly thank you for going beyond the call of whatever it is that you do so well.",
        "Jack: What do you say we get out of here?",
        "Reese: Yeah, let's go to your place.",
        "Jamal: Take care, big boy.",
        "Casey: Bye.",
        "Jack: Talk to you soon.",
        "Casey: Go on -- say it.",
        "Jamal: You really pulled that one out of thin air.",
        "Casey: Moi?",
        "Jamal: Yeah, now, come on, come on. I know you did something weird to make that manager give them a gig here.",
        "Casey: No, no, they really are a great band.",
        "Jamal: Yeah?",
        "Casey: Beyond that -- I'll never tell",
        "jamal: Come on. Come on, come on.",
        "Casey: Nope, nope, nope.",
        "Jamal: Girl, please. I can make you tell me, girl.",
        "Casey: You can make --",
        "jamal: That's right.",
        "Casey: Please. I am the womanf steel. I can leap buildings with a single -- come on, quit! What are you doing?",
        "Jamal: Yeah, but you know what? You got a weakness for guys like me.",
        "Casey: I do -- like you? What are you talking about?",
        "Ian: Next time I kill you.",
        "Lucy: No!",
        "Joshua: I could snap this pretty little stalk with a single twist. What is that?",
        "Lucy: What?",
        "Joshua: Something's wrong. Something's definitely wrong.",
        "[Lucy coughs]",
        "Ian: Lucy? You all right?",
        "Lucy: He tried to kill me, and then he heard something and just took off. I tried to -- I couldn't stop him.",
        "[Frank groans]",
        "Lucy: I -- I had him right where I wanted him, and I couldn't stop him. I let him get away.",
        "Ian: It's ok. We'll get him. We'll go find him.",
        "Lucy: No, it's not ok. Don't you understand? That's not the point. The point is -- ye you were right. Something is very wrong with me. It's not anemia. Something else is wrong.",
        "Ian: Lucy, don'T.",
        "Lucy: No, I'm a slayer. I'm supposed to be able to stop him, and I couldn'T. What's happening to me?",
        "Alison: Oh, my god. Rafe. Oh, my god, I was so worried about you.",
        "Rafe: It's all right.",
        "Alison: You mean you did it?",
        "Livvie: Caleb, come on, let me out! Let me out!",
        "Alison: Let's shut this -- no! Oh, god! Caleb, why did you do that?",
