        "Jamal: So, Kate, how's your boyfriend doing? Here you go. ",
        "Kate: Nothing's changed. ",
        "Jamal: Oh, that's too bad. Sorry to hear that. ",
        "Kate: Thank you for asking, Jamal. ",
        "Ricky: Hey, hey, hey, maybe you should let her concentrate on the contract here. ",
        "Jamal: I'm just asking about her boyfriend. ",
        "Ricky: I know. ",
        "Kate: It's a pretty standard artist's agreement. You know, seems straightforward enough. ",
        "Jamal: No hidden clauses? No \"fine print\" and all that stuff? ",
        "Kate: No, no, nothing that I can see, no. ",
        "Jamal: You sure? ",
        "Ricky: See? I told you, man. ",
        "Jamal: Look \u2013 ",
        "Kate: What's the problem? ",
        "Jamal: Nothing, nothing. I just got a bad feeling about this particular artist, is all. ",
        "*********************************************************************************************",
        "Joshua: Everything is as we discussed? Excellent. No, I'm almost there. And I'm bringing the package with me. ",
        "*********************************************************************************************",
        "Rafe: If I could do anything now, I would make the hurt stop. If I could just have one wish, I would wish that I could get inside your beautiful head and take away all the bad stuff. I would take away all the poison that makes you feel like you're not good enough. I would make all your make-believe real, and I\u2019d make all your dreams come true. ",
        "Rafe: Remember what your dreams are made of, Alison. Just follow your heart. ",
        "Alison: Whoa. I recognize her. That's me. ",
        "Rafe: Of course it is. Since it's your dream, it's the way it's supposed to be. ",
        "*********************************************************************************************",
        "Lucy: Jack! Oh, hi. ",
        "Jack: Lucy \u2013 ",
        "Lucy: Thank goodness I found you. ",
        "Jack: What -- what's wrong? ",
        "Lucy: I need your help. ",
        "Jack: Yeah, sure, anything. ",
        "Lucy: Livvie \u2013 ",
        "Jack: No \u2013 ",
        "Lucy: Wait, wait, wait, wait, she's lost, and I need to find her. ",
        "Jack: Ok. Lucy, I would do anything for you, but when it comes to Livvie, absolutely not. ",
        "Lucy: I know, I know, but you don't understand. ",
        "Jack: Yeah, I do, and I'm sure she's out there getting attention like she always is. ",
        "Lucy: She lost the baby. ",
        "Jack: Oh, no. Ok, Lucy, I really hope you find her, ok? But I have someone waiting for me. ",
        "Lucy: Oh, ok, just listen to this. I would not cross the street for that girl usually. You know that. But this is very serious. The doctors told her that she lost the baby and she didn't believe them, so she ran out of the hospital before she could have that procedure. ",
        "Jack: I don't understand. ",
        "Lucy: Look, what it is, is she's carrying around a dead child. And if we don't find her, Livvie could die, too. ",
        "*********************************************************************************************",
        "[Livvie sobs] ",
        "Livvie: Shh. It'll be all right, baby. It'll be all right. ",
        "Tess: All right -- all right -- all right \u2013 ",

        "man: Happy birthday, princess. ",
        "Young Alison: Daddy! You're here! ",
        "Alison's father: Oh! Didn't I promise you I\u2019d be here? You know I would not disappoint my little girl. ",
        "Young Alison: This is my best birthday ever! ",
        "[Alison's father chuckles] ",
        "Alison\u2019s father: Let me see how beautiful you are. Now, is that a new dress? ",
        "Young Alison: You know it is! ",
        "Alison's father: Come here, sweetheart. ",
        "Alison: You know, that's all I wanted. That's it, you know? ",
        "Rafe: Yeah, I know. And for this moment, it's all yours. ",
        "Young Alison: How am I doing, daddy? ",
        "Alison's father: You must be the most graceful girl in the world. ",
        "Young Alison: I am! ",
        "Alison's father: Oh, I love you, princess. ",
        "Young Alison: I love you, too, daddy. ",
        "*********************************************************************************************",
        "Jack: She really could die? ",
        "Lucy: I'm afraid so. ",
        "Jack: What makes you so sure? ",
        "Lucy: Well -- Ian and Karen -- you trust them? You think they're good doctors, right? ",
        "Jack: Yeah, of course. ",
        "Lucy: All right. They both told me that the baby is no longer viable. Now listen, I understand what you're saying. I know how you feel. Livvie can manipulate herself into anything, and the center of attention every time. But we need to find her because this is serious, so you have to have some idea where she could be. You must have some idea where I could find her. ",
        "Jack: I don't know where Livvie hangs out these days. ",
        "Lucy: Try. Come on, try and think. She really needs our help. ",
        "Jack: Livvie always needs help. ",
        "Lucy: What are you doing here? Why are you being so stubborn? I'm just asking you to help me find her. ",
        "Jack: And I would. But I have someone else who kind of depends on me now. ",
        "Lucy: What, so you met someone else? ",
        "Jack: Well, yeah, kind of, and I'll tell you about it later, but she's really expecting me back. ",
        "Lucy: Wait, who is this girl? Who is this person? ",
        "Jack: She's just a simple, honest girl. ",
        "Lucy: I'm thrilled! Congratulations, I\u2019m glad you're happy. I just don't think you understand. This is a life-and-death situation.",
        "Jack: Lucy, did you just hear a word I just said? ",
        "Lucy: And -- you didn't hear -- ok, look, I know you don't want to help Livvie. I understand that. But I'm not asking you to marry her or even talk to her. I just want you to help me find her. Ok, fine. You know what? Just forget it. You know what? This -- this is really bad and you don't seem to get it. She's probably out there somewhere feeling the effects of this whole thing on her body right now, but, hey, if she dies, no big deal, right? Great, Jack. ",
        "[Lucy sighs] ",
        "*********************************************************************************************",
        "Alison: Where did they go? ",
        "Rafe: They'll be back. Look. ",
        "Alison's father: What are you making there, princess? ",
        "Young Alison: A picture, but I think I ruined it. ",
        "Alison's father: Really? I don't see how. ",
        "Young Alison: I went outside the lines. ",
        "Alison's father: Sweetheart, look at me. You are an artist, Alison. If you choose to go outside the lines, then that's ok. You can be anything in the world that you want to be. Now, let's see. This -- this looks like a princess. ",
        "Young Alison: It's princess Alison and that's king daddy. ",
        "[Alison's father chuckles] ",
        "Alison\u2019s father: Well, we're just going to have to frame that. ",
        "Young Alison: You really like it? ",
        "Alison's father: Sweetheart, it's perfect. ",
        "Alison: They seem to know each other so well. It's like they're connected. ",
        "Young Alison: Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! ",
        "Alison: Why is she crying? ",
        "Rafe: Don't you remember why? ",
        "Alison: It's because there was nobody to catch me when I fell. ",
        "Rafe: That's what you always wanted, wasn't it? Hmm? Someone to be there to catch you, to pick you up. ",
        "[Rafe sighs] ",
        "Rafe: Look. ",
        "Alison's father: That's quite a serious scrape you have there, missy. ",
        "Young Alison: It hurts. ",
        "Alison's father: Oh, I'll bet it does. ",
        "Young Alison: A lot. ",
        "Alison's father: Well, first, I\u2019m afraid we're going to have to operate. ",
        "Then, we're going to need some extensive post-op care. ",
        "Young Alison: Like what? ",
        "Alison's father: Well, what do you think would help you recover from this dreadful accident?",
        " ",
        "Young Alison: I don't know. ",
        "Alison's father: Uh -- ice cream? ",
        "Young Alison: No. ",
        "[Alison's father chuckles] ",
        "Alison\u2019s father: A trip to the circus? ",
        "Young Alison: Well, maybe a little bit. ",
        "Alison's father: Or something i have here in my pocket. ",
        "Young Alison: Yes! Fairy dust! ",
        "Alison: White fairy dust made anything possible. That's what I used to use to pretend that he was really there. Oh, he's just like I pictured him. ",
        "Alison's father's voice: Alison? Princess? Can you hear me? ",
        "Alison: Yes, daddy. ",
        "Alison's father's voice: I'm here, Alison. I'm always going to be here, just like you used to imagine. ",
        "Alison: Well, why won't you let me see you? ",
        "Alison's father's voice: You can. Just close your eyes, sweet girl, and know that I will always, always take care of my little princess. ",
        "Alison: He loves me. ",
        "Rafe: He would be a fool not to. ",
        "Alison: He really -- he really loves me. ",
        "*********************************************************************************************",
        "Ricky: Come on, man. Just give it up, all right? ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, well, you can never be too safe. You know that. ",
        "Ricky: Hey, Marissa, it's Ricky. I just left you a message on your cell phone. ",
        "Jamal: Hey, ask her where she's been. ",
        "Ricky: All right, all right. ",
        "Jamal: Please? ",
        "Ricky: Listen, we were just wondering where you had gone to. We were all hanging out in the recovery room with the band \u2013 ",
        "Jamal: Hey, and tell her about Kate, too. ",
        "Ricky: And then you were gone. All right, I\u2019ll tell her about Kate. Sorry, I got Jamal yapping in my ear. ",
        "Jamal: Just \u2013 ",
        "Ricky: Anyway \u2013 ",
        "Jamal: Tell her about Kate. ",
        "Ricky: So Kate looked over the contracts and she said everything's cool, so we can go ahead and sign with Stephen Clay and start working with him. As a matter of fact, I already got some new material working in my head, so give us a call. All right. Bye. ",
        "Jamal: Look, man, this is not cool at all. It's not. Why would she just disappear like that? Something's going on with her, dude. I swear something's going on with her. ",
        "*********************************************************************************************",
        "Marissa: That's strange. Where did he go? Uh-oh. ",

        "Livvie: Oh! Hush, baby! Oh! If it's hurting me, it's got to be hurting you, too. ",
        "Ow! All those nasty things those terrible doctors said about you in the hospital. Ah. But you're still here. You're not going to leave me and I'm not going to leave you, either. ",
        "Ah! Ow! Oh! We're just going to wait right here. Oh -- we're going to wait for Jack to come and take care of us. Oh, my sweet, special baby. We're going to build a wonderful life together -- yeah, just the three of us. ",
        "Ow! Oh! ",

        "Rafe: Hey, did you have a good rest? ",
        "Alison: Oh. Uh-huh. Oh, that was -- that was the most incredible thing. ",
        "Rafe: What? ",
        "Alison: Do you feel like -- that people's spirits can come visit you in your dreams? ",
        "Rafe: Look who you're asking. ",
        "Alison: No, I'm serious because I just had the most amazing experience. My dad was in my dream and you were there with me and we were watching my childhood, but, I mean, it wasn't my real childhood because he was -- he was there and he was -- he was taking care of me. ",
        "Rafe: That's great. ",
        "Alison: Yeah, it was so real. You know how dreams can get really real like that is -- I -- I felt like what it would really feel like, you know, to really just to really feel what it would feel like to have a daddy in my life. ",
        "Rafe: That's pretty powerful stuff. ",
        "Alison: Hmm. You have no idea. It was almost like -- it was weird. It was almost like he came to me to -- to tell me that he really cared about me, to tell me he was watching me. Isn't that strange? ",
        "Rafe: Well, that depends. How do you feel now that you're awake? ",
        "Alison: I feel really -- I feel, like, peaceful and -- and calm, really loved. I feel really, really loved. ",
        "Rafe: You are loved and cherished and safe. And I'm going to make sure that you feel that way for the rest of your life. ",
        "*********************************************************************************************",
        "Jamal: Ok, ok. No, that's all right. This is really starting to concern me for real. Marissa's still not home. ",
        "Ricky: Why, man? Maybe she's just not answering the phone. ",
        "Jamal: Now, Ricky, come on. When was the last time that girl didn't pick up a ringing phone? ",
        "Ricky: Yeah, definitely. ",
        "Jamal: Thank you, thank you -- forget this. I'm calling her cell phone again. ",

        "Marissa: Look, I can't talk right now! ",
        "Jamal: Well, wait a minute -- hold on. Where you at? We've been trying to track you down forever. Come on! ",
        "Marissa: No, no, no, no, no! Honey, look, look, I -- I'll call you back, ok? I'm following -- ",

        "[Marissa screams] ",
        "Marissa: Ok, who's there? Look, either someone is out here or the wall is made of flesh, ok, so you just might as well show yourself. Joshua? Is that you I hear breathing? ",
