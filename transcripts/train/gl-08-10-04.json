        "Danny: Look, I know the loans are overdue, and I know the amount. You don't have to... listen, you are not going to get your money any faster by calling me every single day. You'll get it when I have it. Good-bye. (Sighs) hey.",
        "Michelle: Hi. You know, the press makes me sound like I'm some clueless wife being victimized by her lying husband.",
        "Danny: Michelle, just ignore it. I'm going to show everybody in this town that they can't believe everything they read and that I still have a lot to offer.",
        "Michelle: Oh, why bother?",
        "Danny: What?",
        "Michelle: I'm serious. Name one person in this town who's worth proving anything to.",
        "Josh: Well, I guess we shouldn't be too surprised. I mean, danny is just the same guy he's always been.",
        "Reva: But to set a bomb that killed eden and could possibly have killed his own wife?",
        "Josh: It looks like that's exactly what happened.",
        "Reva: No. He wouldn't hurt michelle by planting a bomb.",
        "Josh: I don't really know that that's the point anymore. The fact is, eden is dead.",
        "Marina: Boom! That radar gun does not lie, folks. Take a guess. How fast do you think he's been throwing?",
        "Shayne: Marina...",
        "Marina: No, let them guess.",
        "Josh: Mid-80s. How's that?",
        "Marina: Oh, that is softball, baby. He is pitching in the low 90s. That's better than he was before the accident.",
        "Josh: Very nice.",
        "Scout: Your boy's looking good, mr. And mrs. Lewis. Management is going to be very interested. Hey, I'm going to make that call.",
        "Shayne: All right.",
        "Josh: Thank you.",
        "Reva: Sounds very promising.",
        "Shayne: It sure does.",
        "Josh: Well, it's only promising if it's what you want, son. (Ice cream truck music playing)",
        "Rj: Ice cream! Can I?",
        "Cassie: No. No, rj, not this early. (Sighs) (gasps) oh, god! Edmund.",
        "Edmund: Well, hello. A bit jumpy today, aren't you?",
        "Cassie: I'm sorry. I'm just a little edgy these days.",
        "Edmund: Why?",
        "Cassie: Jeffrey o'neill. Rj!",
        "Edmund: Jeffrey o'neill, of course. Why else?",
        "Jeffrey: Danny, danny, danny. Sometimes even I wish you'd catch a break.",
        "Blake: The news is all danny, all the time. Boy, did you call it. I mean, you knew that he wasn't the solid citizen that he claimed to be. I'm glad he's not mayor.",
        "Ross: You know, some time ago, I make this phone call to ed and I tell him that danny and I will not rest until we find out who did this to michelle. Now I've got to call him back and tell him it was danny who did it? I mean, her own husband was... well, isn't this just perfect? Mr. District attorney.",
        "Jeffrey: Mr. Mayor. First lady. How are you guys today?",
        "Ross: I'm stunned. What's your office going to do about this?",
        "Jeffrey: Ah, that. Well, that'S... that's been taken care of.",
        "Ross: Meaning?",
        "Jeffrey: Meaning it's been taken care of, ross. You can let it go.",
        "Edmund: What did jeffrey do this time? Did he threaten you?",
        "Cassie: No. No, it was nothing like that. It was something he said.",
        "Edmund: All right.",
        "Cassie: He was only trying to protect me, but he really freaked me out, edmund.",
        "Edmund: All right. What did he say?",
        "Cassie: Could you go inside for a minute, sweetie? I'll be right there. He told me that I was in danger, and the threat may already be in town.",
        "Cassie: Jeffrey o'neill thinks that the people who are using my identity are a real threat now.",
        "Edmund: \"People\"? When did it become \"people\"?",
        "Cassie: It's not just one woman. It's bigger. She's a part of something very big and much more dangerous, and they know that I'm onto them.",
        "Edmund: And he's afraid they're going to be coming here to hurt you?",
        "Cassie: Yes. But he's promised to stick around and protect me, so.",
        "Edmund: Great. That's great, because then he'll be around even more than usual, if that's possible.",
        "Rj: Mom? I have a question.",
        "Cassie: Well, I'm sure I have an answer.",
        "Dinah: I can help you answer a question that has been burning in the back of your mind ever since jeffrey came",
        "here: Why would a man who looks exactly like your dead brother-- the love of cassie's life-- suddenly show up in this town and move into her hotel?",
        "Cassie: Edmund?",
        "Edmund: Hm? Oh. Cassie, if there's going to be trouble, I think understandably I would like to be the one who protects you and not jeffrey o'neill. I'd like to leave him out of it.",
        "Cassie: He's an fbi agent. He has a case to work, edmund.",
        "Edmund: We've heard that one before. \"He has a case to work, your safety-- the two have nothing to do with one another.",
        "Cassie: Hey! Hey, sweetie-pie. How are you?",
        "Tammy: Good. Are you two busy? I'd like to treat edmund to lunch.",
        "Edmund: Really? What's the occasion?",
        "Tammy: Oh, you're just lucky, I guess. Actually, I need your advice.",
        "Cassie: Go, have fun, and give really good advice.",
        "Edmund: I'll do my best. Let's go.",
        "Cassie: Let's wave bye. Bye. Well, you know what? Looks like it's just you and me, buddy. Come on. Let's finish coloring that picture.",
        "Michelle: I get that we live in this town. Sometimes you've got to go along to get along, I guess. But what I don't get is, why do you care?",
        "Danny: Michelle.",
        "Michelle: I mean, haven't you kind of made a life of, I don't know, doing things your own way? You were a gangster, right?",
        "Danny: Yeah, but I've spent a very long time trying to shake that image and everything related to it, and this bombing could jeopardize all that.",
        "Michelle: Is there a legal problem?",
        "Danny: No. I was working undercover for the government, so I'm off the hook for anything that happened during the investigation.",
        "Michelle: Okay. Well, I was the one who was blown up, and I'm okay with it. The federal government's given you-- what-- immunity.",
        "Danny: Michelle.",
        "Michelle: So why do you care what anybody...",
        "Danny: I'm a businessman. I need other people to do business with.",
        "Michelle: Well, I'm sure there's somebody out there who doesn't care about this stuff.",
        "Danny: Yeah. I'm hoping it's josh. I've got a meeting with him today.",
        "Michelle: After how he turned on you, you're...? Why would you crawl back to this guy?",
        "Danny: Look, I practically owned this entire town not very long ago, and I will again, and josh knows that. I just need you to do me a favor. If anybody calls...",
        "Michelle: Oh, you're on your own on this one.",
        "Danny: What? Why?",
        "Michelle: If you're going to go back to sucking up to people, I don't want to be any part of this.",
        "Danny: I'm not sucking up to anybody. Forget it. You obviously don't understand.",
        "Michelle: Oh, I understand just fine.",
        "Danny: No, I just... I want to drop this.",
        "Michelle: Unless there's something you're not telling me.",
        "Danny: No, I need to get to this meeting. Let's just drop it, okay?",
        "Michelle: Well, I'm going to go get a burger.",
        "Danny: (Sighs) okay. So, I'll see you later.",
        "Michelle: All right. You can tell josh I said, \"go jump in a lake.\"",
        "Reva: We just don't want you to feel like you're going back in time.",
        "Marina: Well, that's not what I want, either.",
        "Shayne: I know.",
        "Josh: We also know that you have more on your mind than just baseball, son.",
        "Shayne: Well, I just don't want to make a big deal out of everything.",
        "Josh: Okay.",
        "Reva: Well, I mean, you're our son. Anything that has anything to do with your life, we're going to make a big deal out of.",
        "Shayne: Yeah. Hey, what'S... what's going on with danny, anyway? Is all this stuff they're writing about him really true?",
        "Reva: Well, we know that he was working undercover for the feds. We know that much to be true.",
        "Josh: Well, we also know that whatever he was into, somehow eden august ended up dead and michelle's life has changed forever, and it's pretty much his fault.",
        "Marina: Danny never meant to hurt michelle. I think we all need to remember that and give him a second chance.",
        "Josh: Well, I'm a big fan of second chances. I just think this situation is different.",
        "Shayne: Well, how so?",
        "Josh: Well, danny, he knew the risks. He knew the situation, and he made the choices that he made. One person was killed, a lot of people were hurt, and we were all duped.",
        "Marina: Still, a second chance is a second chance. I mean, friends and family deserve that much. I learned that from my grandfather. And from you, mr. Lewis. The important thing is that once you get that do-over, you don't waste it.",
        "Edmund: What is so important that we ran almost three red lights to get here?",
        "Tammy: It's this whole stupid spaulding internship competition. I need help.",
        "Edmund: I thought you righted that ship.",
        "Tammy: Uh, you need to check in with me every hour, on the hour, uncle edmund.",
        "Edmund: Right. Well, I'm sorry I fell down on the job.",
        "Tammy: You know how we had to start a project with only a hundred bucks?",
        "Edmund: Yes, and you started to run a car wash.",
        "Tammy: Yes, well, lizzie has decided to sic the permit police on me and squash my business.",
        "Edmund: Well, if you're looking for ways to recoup your losses...",
        "Tammy: Uncle edmund, you're good at business, but what you're even better at is revenge.",
        "Edmund: That's just a vicious rumor, I assure you.",
        "Tammy: Don't be modest. What I need is a crash course in getting even.",
        "Ross: As mayor of this city, I need to know if you're going to prosecute danny santos for the warehouse bombing or not.",
        "Jeffrey: Not.",
        "Blake: What are you talking about? A woman died in the explosion. What kind of da are you?",
        "Jeffrey: It's being handled on a federal level. That's all I'm at liberty to say, really. I'm sorry.",
        "Ross: You're going to wrap this case in so much federal red tape that danny is never going to see the inside of a courtroom, is that it?",
        "Jeffrey: Ross, let it go.",
        "Ross: You have a responsibility to this city, and so do I-- to uphold the law and... (cell phone rings) yes, what is it?",
        "Dinah: Daddy, can you talk?",
        "Ross: Excuse me, I have to take this. Yeah, I'm here, but you've caught me at kind of a bad time. How can I help you?",
        "Dinah: I'm a little concerned about jeffrey o'neill, the da. Have you heard any word with my situation, as far as he's concerned?",
        "Ross: Uh, no, not at this time, and you should know that that is kind of a tough nut to crack. In fact, I can see him right this minute.",
        "Dinah: Is he there with you? The da?",
        "Ross: Among others, yeah.",
        "Dinah: Blake, is she there with you, too?",
        "Ross: I would say yes.",
        "Dinah: Okay. Well, then I better let you go.",
        "Ross: Good idea.",
        "Dinah: Hey. For what it's worth, I hate that you have to keep lying to protect me.",
        "Ross: Well, neither of us wants that, do we? But things are what they are, and they will work out.",
        "Dinah: Yeah, I don't want you to worry. This will all be over very, very soon.",
        "Ross: Hello?",
        "Blake: Is everything okay?",
        "Ross: Yeah, it's fine.",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, ross? Perhaps we could discuss that other matter you wanted to talk about.",
        "Ross: That's a little complicated, so why don't we do it later?",
        "Jeffrey: Understood.",
        "Ross: More coffee?",
        "Reva: Shayne, watching you pitch has always been something special, but today... well, i just don't have the words.",
        "Marina: And neither does he.",
        "Shayne: I just... I said i just didn't want to make a big deal out of it.",
        "Marina: Right. I forgot. Nothing's a big deal.",
        "Shayne: I don't mean I don't care.",
        "Marina: I just don't get it, shayne. This meant so much to you. You worked so hard to get at this point, and now... now it's nothing? I mean, was your old life really that bad? (Cell phone rings) I have to get it. It's my dad.",
        "Josh: I have to leave. I have an appointment, but I'll be back as quick as I can, okay? I want to talk about this some more.",
        "Shayne: Yeah, sure. Sure.",
        "Reva: You don't have to tiptoe around anymore. Marina's not here. Besides, I think she'd probably punch me out if she heard me say this.",
        "Shayne: What's that?",
        "Reva: You're miserable.",
        "Tammy: I went back to the lake. I don't know why. Maybe to say something to joey, maybe to see him one more time. But then I saw lizzie working this whole scam. She paid the guy off. I mean, all those cds he bought from joey? Total fraud. So I snapped a picture and-- voila-- instant payback potential.",
        "Edmund: You know what interests me?",
        "Tammy: How I can use this to totally destroy lizzie?",
        "Edmund: No. What interests me is how you felt when you turned back to talk to joey and saw this instead.",
        "Tammy: What difference does it make? I caught a break here. Lizzie scamming joey like this? It's going to blow her out of the water.",
        "Sandy: And blow joey out of the water.",
        "Tammy: Hello? Butt into conversations much?",
        "Sandy: Sorry.",
        "Tammy: It's okay. I can use all the help I can get. As long as it's something I can use against lizzie.",
        "Edmund: That's the point, i think.",
        "Tammy: What is?",
        "Edmund: The point that sandy started to make and that I'm about to make.",
        "Tammy: No. No. I do not want the emotionally mature, politically correct answer to my problem, okay? I want the cut-throat, go-for- broke, total annihilation of the enemy answer to my problem.",
        "Edmund: Are you interested in winning a contest or winning a boy's heart?",
        "Tammy: Can't I do both?",
        "Edmund: I don't know.",
        "Tammy: Uncle edmund, when joey found out that lizzie pulled that permit stunt on me, he was all over her. But, I mean, this? What she's doing right now? She's giving him false hope about his music, the one thing that he loves more than anything else in his life, including me.",
        "Edmund: You want to tell joey that lizzie lied to him about some potential record deal.",
        "Sandy: But you don't want to hurt him in the process.",
        "Tammy: Yeah.",
        "Edmund and sandy: Can't be done.",
        "Blake: You know, that guy, he really bugs me. He doesn't have enough time to go after criminals, but all the time in the world to butt into your business. He's a jerk. So, what was the phone call?",
        "Ross: What?",
        "Blake: The phone call that you took.",
        "Ross: Oh. City business.",
        "Blake: About what?",
        "Ross: Blake, were you on the ballot, too? I mean, were people voting for the both of us?",
        "Blake: What?",
        "Ross: Just let city business stay my business, okay?",
        "Blake: Ross.",
        "Michelle: Can I get a to-go order?",
        "Waitress: Sure.",
        "Ross: Hello, michelle. I saw your interview. Look, I'm sorry.",
        "Michelle: Oh, yeah. Yeah, it wasn't really my best work. But, hey, it was my first live television appearance.",
        "Blake: Ross was talking about danny, the fact that he's the one responsible for where you are today.",
        "Michelle: Yeah. I'm fine with where I am. But more to the point, I don't really know you or why you care what danny did or didn't do.",
        "Ross: You know, as a friend of your father...",
        "Michelle: Yeah, yeah. Well, I don't really know my father, either. Is that hard for you to hear? Tough. Because I don'T. Don't know him, don't know you or you. And you guys really don't know me, either, so bottom line: Mind your own business.",
        "Cassie: Could you watch him for a few minutes? I have some books and stuff over there.",
        "Bellhop: Yeah, sure.",
        "Cassie: Thanks.",
        "Bellhop: Come on, rj.",
        "Cassie: I saw your interview with salerno last night.",
        "Danny: Yeah, who didn't?",
        "Cassie: Look, I know that you would never intentionally hurt michelle, danny.",
        "Danny: Well, that's good, cassie. I had no idea she was there.",
        "Cassie: You don't have to explain to me because, you know, it doesn't really make a difference. At the end of the day, you did what you did. You knew the risks and you did it anyway.",
        "Danny: Okay. Thanks for understanding.",
        "Cassie: Come on. Do you want me to give you a shoulder to cry on?",
        "Danny: Nope.",
        "Cassie: You blew up a warehouse. Sure, you didn't know your wife was inside, but is that an excuse?",
        "Danny: Cassie, I was working undercover. I had no choice.",
        "Cassie: What about eden, danny?",
        "Danny: I am paying for that every day.",
        "Cassie: You're my business partner, okay? I took a gamble going into business with you, but it was a gamble that I wanted to take.",
        "Danny: I know. I know that you never bargained for any of this.",
        "Cassie: No.",
        "Danny: I know that.",
        "Cassie: None of it. I cosigned loans. I could be dragged down with you. Now, please tell me you have the money for this.",
        "Bellhop: Oh, wait here for one second, okay, rj? Thanks. (Ice cream truck music playing)",
        "Danny: Cassie, you know, one of the main reasons that I went undercover in the first place was to protect you and tony from prosecution.",
        "Cassie: Prosecution from things that you set into motion to begin with, danny.",
        "Danny: What? What is this?",
        "Cassie: Loans. They're overdue.",
        "Danny: I know... cassie, I am well aware of the loans. I have been talking to the bank.",
        "Cassie: Really? Because they're calling me, too. They are. And they're coming after us, okay? Now, I know that your intentions were good, but your actions weren'T. If you default on these loans, I'm going to lose my hotel. So fix this-- now.",
        "Dinah: (Laughs) was I right or was I right? Did I read your mind or what, buddy? (Laughs) good.",
        "Edmund: Coming up on \"guiding light\"...",
        "Cassie: Rj?",
        "Dinah: Okay. Listen, mommy's calling, so you've got to run, bud.",
        "Josh: He just got off the phone with the gm at the cubs. They want to talk to shayne about playing pro ball. Oprah: How do you survive the",
        "Edmund: The more, the merrier. Sit.",
        "Sandy: Women. So ungrateful.",
        "Edmund: Hm.",
        "Sandy: So, as I see it, first thing, let go of the spaulding internship angle, because that's not what this is really about.",
        "Tammy: I still want to win.",
        "Sandy: I know, but that doesn't do it for you. Lizzie will still be breathing when you're done. So, your real dilemma is: Should you tell joey about lizzie or should you keep your mouth shut and miss out on an opportunity to stick it to her?",
        "Tammy: Well, my vote-- since it is my life-- is \"stick it to lizzie any way that I can.\" That's what she's always doing to me. That girl never misses an opportunity to make my life miserable.",
        "Edmund: But your not answering the question that really matters.",
        "Sandy: Do you want joey back, or do you just want revenge?",
        "Ross: Blake, I think we should be going.",
        "Blake: In a minute, all right? Listen, honey. We're just worried about you. It's very difficult to pretend that we don't know you or that we weren't friends.",
        "Michelle: Can I get my order, please?",
        "Waitress: Coming up.",
        "Michelle: Look, I'd like to say that I appreciate your concern and maybe the old michelle would. But me? I'm just trying to live my life the way I want to.",
        "Blake: I understand that. And I understand that you might be upset. You were just getting to know danny, right? And now you find out he's the one responsible for the explosion.",
        "Michelle: Almost makes a girl wish she never woke up from her coma. See, you know what I really figured out? I figured out that this town is full of hypocrites. And you, ross-- you-- are the mayor of hypocriteville.",
        "Ross: Michelle, nobody is asking you to turn your back completely on your husband.",
        "Michelle: (Laughs) hey, there's no room for me in that pile-on.",
        "Ross: But you can't defend danny without question after what's happened to you. You don't remember your dad. You don't remember your son. Your former life has been completely erased.",
        "Michelle: It's not about defending him, okay? I don't know what danny did or didn't do. It just doesn't really seem to matter right now.",
        "Ross: I think that it should.",
        "Michelle: Oh, why? Why can't I just start a new life? Why are you people holding on to who I was, huh?",
        "Blake: Because we want to understand. We love you.",
        "Michelle: Yeah, well, maybe... maybe danny did me a favor. Because, see, I don't really remember who I was, but I'm betting that I was just as uptight and judgmental as the both of you. So, no offense, but I was the one who was blown up, and I got over it. So, everyone else might as well, too. Okay? Everyone hear that? Huh? I'm not the same person, so get over it!",
        "Danny: I promise you, you will not pay for my mistakes. Okay?",
        "Cassie: You have the money for those loans?",
        "Danny: I have a meeting with josh right now to do a deal that will make us more than enough money to cover everything.",
        "Cassie: You're taking a meeting today?",
        "Danny: Yeah. Why? So?",
        "Cassie: I just thought you'd be home with michelle. After everything that happened last night, trying to make everything up to her.",
        "Danny: Every marriage is different, I guess.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, I guess so, because if it were me, I would be making you pay for it for the rest of your natural life.",
        "Danny: Well, cassie, michelle is actually dealing with this a lot better than anyone else in this town. She's actually being understanding.",
        "Cassie: A lot more forgiving than I could ever be.",
        "Danny: Coming from the woman living with edmund winslow?",
        "Dinah: I knew that you would like butter-brickle, just like your daddy. ( Laughs) he got it all over his face just like you're doing right now. You know, you are such a good kid. You really are. You know, I almost had one, too. And if I did, I bet a thousand million bucks he'd be just like you. Hey, listen. What do you say you help your special imaginary friend deliver a very important message. Do you want to do that? I've been working on a great idea.",
        "Bellhop: Mrs. Winslow? I'm terribly sorry, but rj got away from me again.",
        "Cassie: Oh. Oh, okay. Danny...",
        "Danny: Go. Go find him. Everything is going to be fine.",
        "Cassie: He's probably in my office, you know? He loves playing in my office.",
        "Danny: Josh. There you are.",
        "Josh: Danny.",
        "Danny: Yeah. Good to see you. Okay. I'm getting the feeling this is not going to be as productive a meeting as I hoped. I thought we were meeting with investors.",
        "Josh: Yeah, that's not going to happen. I'm sorry, but I've decided that I'm not going to do business with you, and I don't think anybody else in this town will, either.",
        "Danny: Why am I not surprised?",
        "Dinah: Okay. All right, just like we said, okay?",
        "Jeffrey: Hello?",
        "Rj: Hello?",
        "Jeffrey: Rj? Rj, what are you doing?",
        "Rj: Where are you?",
        "Jeffrey: I'm at company. And so is your uncle edmund. What are you doing, rj?",
        "Rj: Talking to you.",
        "Jeffrey: Yes, I know. What I meant was, is your mother there?",
        "Rj: No. But my imaginary friend is. She wants you to come and play with us.",
        "Jeffrey: All right, listen to me, rj. I need to know where you are. Okay? Are you at the farm? Are you at the hotel?",
        "Rj: Yes.",
        "Jeffrey: Yes. Which one is it, buddy? Come on, I need to know. Where are you?",
        "Rj: The beacon.",
        "Dinah: That was great. It was phenomenal. (Laughs) I'll buy you another ice cream, huh? No, no, no, no, no, no. Okay, mom probably would not like that. She'd get upset, huh? It was great.",
        "Jeffrey: (Sighs) oh, god. Cassie? This is jeffrey. Listen, you need to get back to me as soon as you get this, all right? I'm on my way to the hotel.",
        "Edmund: Excuse me.",
        "Tammy: Where are you going?",
        "Edmund: Tammy, when someone goes after the people you care about, you have to take action. It's a fight. Never forget that.",
        "Cassie: Rj! Rj!",
        "Dinah: Okay. Listen, mommy's calling, so you've got to run, bud. All right?",
        "Rj: I'll miss you.",
        "Dinah: I'll miss you, too. Secret handshake. Thanks for everything, okay?",
        "Cassie: Look at you! You hustled the valet into getting you ice cream when i told you no ice cream. Didn't I?",
        "Rj: My imaginary friend got it for me.",
        "Cassie: Really? Your favorite? I bet you're loving this imaginary friend, aren't you?",
        "Danny: Wait. We had a deal.",
        "Josh: Yeah. My father used to say deals are made to be broken. Now, that's not my person business philosophy, but I think it makes sense in this case.",
        "Danny: Well, am I not the same guy that you knew last week when we made this agreement?",
        "Josh: No, danny, you're not. Look, I'm sorry, it's not just me, okay? The investors have pulled out. They don't want to do business with somebody like you.",
        "Danny: I see. And since when do you give in to public opinion?",
        "Josh: That's not what this is about, and you know it. This is about who you are: Carmen's heir apparent. You cleaned yourself up a little bit, but you're still dirty. Sorry.",
        "Ross: Michelle, you don't have to do things like this, you know?",
        "Michelle: Yeah? Well, maybe I want to.",
        "Blake: This is not the way to make your point, michelle. Trust me.",
        "Michelle: Yeah, you've got another suggestion? Because the press sure isn't helping. Hey, your mom is some media big- shot, isn't she? Why don't you tell her to freak out about somebody else and take danny and I off the front page.",
        "Blake: Honey, if you were just a little more of yourself.",
        "Michelle: Yeah. Sorry, lady. What you see is what you get.",
        "Blake: But if you remembered...",
        "Michelle: Yeah, well, i don'T.",
        "Waitress: There you go.",
        "Michelle: Thank you. And you know what? I don't care if I ever remember who I was.",
        "Reva: You have earned all the luck and the blessings that come to you from this point in your life on. You've worked hard to get where you are today. You have worked through pain, rehab, depression.",
        "Shayne: I know. Everything's great, and that's why I want to do something like...",
        "Reva: Play baseball.",
        "Shayne: Well, that's what I'm supposed to do, right? That's my gift. I just wonder if there's maybe not another reason that I'm good at baseball.",
        "Marina: All right. Strike a pose, dude. This is going to be your first baseball card.",
        "Shayne: Not right now. I'm going to take a walk.",
        "Marina: By yourself?",
        "Shayne: Yeah.",
        "Marina: Well, I could... okay. Was I being pushy?",
        "Reva: Marina cooper, pushy? (Laughs) I just think he's a little overwhelmed right now.",
        "Marina: Yeah. Well, I just keep thinking whatever he's going through, it's not about his past thoughts, it's about the ones right now. I just don't have a clue what they are.",
        "Reva: Just be ready to listen when he wants to tell you. I know one thing he's sure of: His feelings for you. That was a quick meeting.",
        "Josh: Yeah, yeah. Well, there wasn't a whole lot to talk about unfortunately. Look at who I ran into on the way over, though.",
        "Scout: I have good news.",
        "Josh: He just got off the phone with the gm at the cubs. They want to talk to shayne about playing pro ball.",
        "Marina: (Laughs) all right.",
        "Cassie: How'd it go? Josh didn't look too happy when he left.",
        "Danny: Yeah, it was a very short meeting. Look, there's still plenty of people in this town who would be more than happy to work with me. I just have to get in touch with them.",
        "Cassie: Can you find them fast?",
        "Danny: You're not going to lose your hotel, cassie.",
        "Cassie: Danny.",
        "Danny: Just trust me. Okay?",
        "Cassie: You have more ice cream on your shirt than you got in your tummy. Now, look, I want you to tell me the truth, okay? Who was out here with you before mommy came out here?",
        "Rj: I told you. My imaginary friend.",
        "Cassie: Oh, yeah? Well, where'd she go?",
        "Michelle: Bills, bills. Ooh. That's not chump change. And way overdue. Wow.",
        "Danny: Will phillip be free any time today? Uh-huh. Is it that his schedule doesn't have time for anybody, or just anybody named danny santos. Yeah, right, okay. Okay. Yeah. Thanks. Hey. I thought you were going out to eat.",
        "Michelle: Oh, I got it to go. I wasn't really in the mood for people today.",
        "Danny: Yeah. Me, too.",
        "Michelle: So, how was your meeting?",
        "Danny: Let's just say that josh and I weren't exactly on the same page today.",
        "Michelle: Did he give you one of those big, snooty, holier- than-thou lectures?",
        "Danny: The short version. And then he backed out on our deal and took off.",
        "Michelle: I'm sorry.",
        "Danny: It's okay. It's all right. Look, I don't want you to worry about this kind of stuff. I mean it.",
        "Michelle: I'm not.",
        "Danny: Okay? Please.",
        "Michelle: I'm not. You know, who cares if josh lewis doesn't want to do business with you?",
        "Danny: Right.",
        "Michelle: Who cares if no one in this town wants to do business with you?",
        "Danny: Right.",
        "Michelle: It's not like we're desperate for money, right?",
        "Danny: You're right. You're right. All we need is each other. Come here.",
        "Tammy: What do you think of this whole situation with joey and lizzie?",
        "Sandy: I think I need to make myself less available so everyone doesn't come to me with their problems.",
        "Tammy: But you're so good at solving stuff.",
        "Sandy: It's a curse.",
        "Tammy: Well, you were the one who was eavesdropping in the first place.",
        "Sandy: Can I take that back?",
        "Tammy: Too late. Fix my life.",
        "Sandy: Well, you really don't want my opinion. You just want to do what you want to do.",
        "Tammy: And?",
        "Sandy: Go for it. Why not?",
        "Tammy: Yeah. You know, I'm going to take the fight to lizzie.",
        "Sandy: As long as you're fighting for something. I'm all for fighting for something-- like fighting for joey and not fighting against lizzie.",
        "Tammy: I am. I really love joey.",
        "Sandy: Well, then he's a lucky guy.",
        "Marina: Thank you so much. This is just incredible. Oh, I know shayne had his doubts, but when he hears this. I'm going to go find him and tell him the good news.",
        "Josh: (Laughs)",
        "Reva: Well, you'd think marina made it into the majors, huh?",
        "Josh: Well, that's probably exactly how she feels. I mean, she... she's been there for him through everything, you know? She knew his habits, she knew his pitches, she knew the things that he needed to do to get better even before I did.",
        "Reva: Yeah, but then you figured it out. You just went into overdrive.",
        "Josh: Yes, I did. That's true. That's okay, that's okay. I still haven't quite forgiven myself for pushing him so hard before the accident.",
        "Reva: Yeah, but you know what? You learned something very special. The saving grace is that you learned that there's something you'll never do again, because shayne could come to you with plans for an alpaca farm and you'd back him up.",
        "Josh: Alpacas? That would be cool. You know, I have not been able to watch a single inning of baseball, not one highlight on tv without thinking about shayne.",
        "Reva: We didn't know if he'd ever be able to walk again.",
        "Josh: Yeah. That's true. For a while I thought we were going to have to make the entire house wheelchair accessible, you know? I thought more often than i would care to admit that he would be in a chair for the rest of his life.",
        "Reva: But he won't be. And you need to stop this. You need to get through this guilt because it's not doing anyone any good. Shayne's dreams came true.",
        "Josh: Whatever those dreams may be.",
        "Reva: Baseball, whatever.",
        "Josh: He's got his life back and he's with us, and that's what we've always wanted.",
        "Blake: All right, let me... let me get this clear. We don't have to like this new michelle, right? I mean, this is basically like meeting a brand-new person and you don't have to like everybody you meet, right?",
        "Ross: Well, we do have to give her some time to get accustomed to this new life.",
        "Blake: All right. I can do that. So, listen, I'm going to run. I have to go to the angels office. I'll see you later at home?",
        "Ross: Yes. I'll make a late dinner.",
        "Blake: Oh. An apology for snapping at me earlier?",
        "Ross: Uh, no. It's just that I grill steaks better than you do.",
        "Blake: So no apology?",
        "Ross: Blake, it would be impossible for me to report to you on every phone call that i take.",
        "Blake: Report to me? What are you... (sighs) do you want to have this fight?",
        "Ross: No, no, I don'T.",
        "Blake: Good. Let's drop it, then. I was just curious. Medium rare. Red wine, please. Apology accepted.",
        "Shayne: Hey, ross.",
        "Ross: Hi, shayne. You've been playing ball?",
        "Shayne: I've been working out, yeah.",
        "Ross: Oh, good. How do you feel? Must be a little rusty.",
        "Shayne: You know, I was throwing today and my fastball was 91.",
        "Ross: 91? That's big league stuff. You don't seem all that excited about it, though.",
        "Shayne: Ross, do you remember your speech the fourth of july when you were talking about service and about giving something back?",
        "Ross: Yeah.",
        "Shayne: I want to do that.",
        "Ross: Well, that's wonderful. And there are many organizations around town.",
        "Shayne: That's nice, but i was thinking about something... something a little b)<\u00d16w >",
        "Ross: So you have a plan in mind?",
        "Shayne: Yes. And I don't think my parents are really going to like it.",
        "Ross: Why not?",
        "Shayne: Because it could mean risking the life that I've just gotten back.\u00f1B 7q",
        "Cassie: Imaginary friend, huh?\u00e7\u00f3 my foot.6.?Lf*q lp%ch one of these valets didzy\u00e7\u00d1i you sucker into gettinj?\u00edIce cream?",

        "Cassie: I want to know it all. I want to know how this imaginary friend knows that your favorite ice cream is butter- brickle.",
        "Dinah: (Laughs) oh, look who's here. Mr. Hero. Can he save the day? Huh? Run, jeffrey, run. Run. Or the world will be short one princess. (Planter scraping)",
        "Josh: Next, on \"guiding light\"...",
        "Reva: In bosnia!",
        "Shayne: I'll be okay.",
        "Reva: Can we let him do this?",
        "Josh: I don't really know that we have any choice, reva.",
