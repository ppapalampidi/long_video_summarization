        "Marah: Hi.",
        "Jeffrey: Hi. Marah, it's... it's morning.",
        "Marah: No, it's still dark out.",
        "Jeffrey: (Laughs) No. It really is morning. Happy New Year.",
        "Marah: If it we were in California, it wouldn't be morning yet. It's two hours earlier there.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, well, unfortunately we're not in California.",
        "Marah: Let's pretend like we are. We're in a house on the ocean and near the surface.",
        "Jeffrey: Coming through the window.",
        "Marah: Yeah. The winds are crashing in. They're kissing the sand. Kiss...",
        "Jeffrey: (Sighs) Oh, damn it.",
        "Eden: Yes, I'm worried. Mr. Machine Man says that Bill and Danny are looking for serious trouble and that's the least we hear from him? I don't like it.",
        "Bill: Hey.",
        "Eden: I've got to go. Hey, you. What a surprise.",
        "Bill: What are you doing? Setting up a late date?",
        "Eden: I am prepping a shoot for Bad Girl at Tony's ranch.",
        "Bill: Oh, yeah. Really? And that was Tony?",
        "Eden: Yeah. How about you come on the shoot and afterwards we go skiing?",
        "Bill: I'd love to. I would love to, but I am swamped. This campaign is taking up more and more of my time.",
        "Eden: Actually there's something I want to talk to you about.",
        "Bill: Sure. And I need to talk to you about Tony.",
        "Joey: Happy New Year, Mrs. Winslow.",
        "Cassie: Same to you, Joey. Tammy will be right down. She's running late.",
        "Joey: That's Tammy. Nice flowers.",
        "Cassie: Thank you. Edmund gave them to me. So did you guys have fun at the dance last night?",
        "Joey: It was great.",
        "Cassie: What time did you get in?",
        "Joey: Not too late. Around 12:30.",
        "Edmund: It was exactly 1:37. I know because I was very much awake at the time. The happiest of new years.",
        "Tammy: So much for that New Year's resolution about not being late. Hey.",
        "Joey: Happiest of new years. You know what? I can't do this.",
        "Josh: Hi. Shayne's still sleeping.",
        "Reva: Is there any change?",
        "Josh: Only on the calendar. Happy New Year.",
        "Reva: (Laughs) Poor Marina.",
        "Josh: She's young. She'll be fine.",
        "Reva: How about you?",
        "Josh: Oh, I'm old, but fine.",
        "(Laughter)",
        "Reva: You know I had a dream that we were fine. We were in the State Room of this big ship. And we were in the bed and the only thing you could hear was the thrum of the engines. It was just like time had stopped.",
        "Josh: I've had dreams like that.",
        "Reva: You know, yesterday when we were talking about Shayne growing up, I felt so honored and so proud that he's my son and that you're his dad. And I guess one way to start the new year is by saying thank you.",
        "Marah: I fell back asleep.",
        "Jeffrey: Yes, you did.",
        "Marah: Are you going to tell me that it's morning again.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, it really is. I can't lie.",
        "Marah: I guess it's time to go.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, that's probably a good idea.",
        "Marah: Back to our regular lives, whatever they are.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, well, that's... that's who we really are. This... Well, this is like a gift that we gave to each other.",
        "Marah: Right. A holiday treat.",
        "Jeffrey: Marah, are you sorry?",
        "Marah: No. Are you?",
        "Jeffrey: Are you kidding? Of course not.",
        "Marah: Then everything's great. You did everything you said you were going to do last night. You made me feel cherished. That was the word you used. I love that word.",
        "Jeffrey: I meant it.",
        "Marah: And you made me feel special. And beautiful.",
        "Jeffrey: You are.",
        "Marah: Even this morning.",
        "Jeffrey: All the time, every day.",
        "Marah: But a deal's a deal. And now I've got to live up to my end of it. So...",
        "Jeffrey: Are you all right?",
        "Marah: All the time, every day. I wouldn't mind cleaning up a little bit first, but, yeah, other than that I am fine. What, you don't believe me?",
        "Jeffrey: Just checking.",
        "Marah: We are two adults who had a wonderful night together. And as you pointed out, it's morning now... somewhere out there. There's just one other thing that I want to know.",
        "Jeffrey: What?",
        "Marah: Did you sleep with me out of pity?",
        "Tammy: You can't what? Go out to breakfast with all the guys from the baseball team? You don't want to go.",
        "Joey: Yeah, yeah, I want to go.",
        "Tammy: So what is it?",
        "Joey: It's nothing.",
        "Tammy: I left my bag upstairs. I'll be right back.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, will you excuse me for a minute. I think Joey and I need to have a little chat.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, okay.",
        "Edmund: Hey, Joey. So what seems to be the problem? Just spit it out.",
        "Joey: I want today to be really special for Tammy. Except I'm no good when it comes to being Mr. Romance, you know.",
        "Edmund: Well, it does take some work.",
        "Joey: Maybe you can help. Because I'm not even sure Tammy's ready for this. I mean it's a big step for a girl. Especially for her first time. And if there's anyone who can make the right moves with Tammy, it's definitely you.",
        "Edmund: Oh, my God.",
        "Josh: No. No. No, no, no, no, no. I'm not talking about that. If I was talking about that, I wouldn't talk about that with you.",
        "Edmund: All right, fine. Then what exactly are you talking about, Joey?",
        "Joey: This.",
        "Edmund: A balled up bunch of tissue paper.",
        "Joey: No, it's my baseball ring. I want to give it to Tammy, but I'm not sure what to say or how to do it.",
        "Edmund: Oh. Well, what did you have in mind? Show me. Pretend I'm Tammy.",
        "Joey: (Laughs) All right. Tammy?",
        "Edmund: Hmm?",
        "Joey: I think you're really great, so here.",
        "Edmund: Well, that's a very good jumping off point. It has sincerity, which is a plus. But presentation could never be underestimated. So am I correct in assuming this ring came in a box?",
        "Joey: I don't know where it is.",
        "Edmund: Right. Right. There. Hold and wait. And this top... there. Simple. It's striking.",
        "Joey: Wow. That's like... that's like magic.",
        "Edmund: Yeah, well, hold your applause until we work on the verbal portion of the program. So here just seems to lack certain poetry.",
        "Joey: So what I say to Tammy is suppose to rhyme?",
        "Reva: Did you get any sleep at all?",
        "Josh: Oh, no. Not really.",
        "Reva: You know what? Why don't you go over to Company and get something to eat and I'll come and get you if there's any news.",
        "Josh: Okay. Thanks. (Laughs)",
        "Marina: Hey. What happened?",
        "Reva: Nothing yet, sweetie.",
        "Josh: Shayne was pretty heavily sedated last night. He's still sleeping.",
        "Marina: I gotta call my dad, let him know where I am.",
        "Josh: Well, I'm going that way. I'll walk with you.",
        "Marina: All right.",
        "Christopher: Happy New Year, Reva.",
        "Reva: Christopher. Happy New Year. So are you checking up on a patient?",
        "Christopher: A friend.",
        "Reva: Well, I'm glad you came. How did you hear?",
        "Christopher: Ed Bauer told me when I checked in on another patient. He said that Shayne's surgery went well.",
        "Reva: Yeah, thank God.",
        "Christopher: It's good to see you and Josh so comfortable together just now.",
        "Reva: You know, I have to give you credit for that. No, really I do. If it hadn't been for all of your help and advice, I don't think I've ever would have gotten past the anger that I built up.",
        "Christopher: You did all the work, Reva.",
        "Reva: But you made me believe that it could happen. That in time I could find all that love that I had for the man.",
        "Christopher: Are you saying you're there?",
        "Reva: Yes, I am. All those old memories just came flooding back and the feelings. I guess it's a miracle. I am one satisfied customer.",
        "Christopher: Well, I'm happy for you. I'm sure that Shayne's going to be okay.",
        "Reva: Oh, I hope so. I should probably go and peek in on him. Thank you again. You know something? You have been wonderful.",
        "Bill: All right, well, ladies first. Campaign.",
        "Eden: Have you've gotten any threatening emails or weird phone messages, stuff like that?",
        "Bill: Threatening emails? No. Everyone in Springfield loves me. No, I'm kidding. I haven't gotten a thing. Why? You really worried about me?",
        "Eden: Enough to ask.",
        "Bill: Well, I am fine. We are fine. No, wait a minute. We are better than fine. We are indestructible.",
        "Eden: Oh, really?",
        "Bill: Yeah. Give me some of this. All right, now I need to talk to you about Tony.",
        "Eden: Sure.",
        "Bill: Well, it's nothing new really. I just... I don't think he nor his image are good for Danny's campaign. Now Danny's not too worried about it, but I am.",
        "Eden: And why are you talking to me about this?",
        "Bill: Well, I was just thinking the more time he spends on Bad Girl photo shoots at his ranch, the less time he has to be front and center of this campaign.",
        "Eden: Oh. So in other words, you want me to cut down on his visibility.",
        "Bill: Well, out of sight, out of mind. At least that's what I'm hoping for. So come on, if you don't mind, you would need to keep Tony under wraps. Call it a public service.",
        "Marah: You didn't answer my question, because there's the answer right there.",
        "Jeffrey: I didn't answer your question because it was ridiculous. I mean, did I sleep with you out of pity? Come on. That's insulting that you would even think that let alone ask me that.",
        "Marah: First insult of the new year and it's still New Year's Day. Can't accuse me of wasting time.",
        "Jeffrey: Marah, I...",
        "Marah: What? What were you going to say?",
        "Jeffrey: How you felt last night and this morning, cherished, is because I do, I do cherish you.",
        "Marah: He said as she picks up the last pieces of clothing off his hotel room floor.",
        "Jeffrey: You want a fight? I'm a good fighter, you know.",
        "Marah: No. No, I don't want to fight. I just... I want to get back in bed with you. We made our own rules last night. Why can't we do it again?",
        "Jeffrey: It doesn't work that way, Marah.",
        "Marah: Not for you. But, Jeffrey, I'm not begging. I just really... I really enjoyed being with you.",
        "Jeffrey: And I really enjoyed being with you. And it's memory that I'm going to treasure and I hope it's one that you will, too.",
        "Marah: Can you do that? Can you cherish someone one night and then not the next day? Can you turn it on and off like a switch like that? Seriously. I want to know.",
        "Jeffrey: If you're asking if this could turn into something, I'd have to say no. Hey, but you know what? It's a brand new year. Who knows, right? Anything could happen. Weird stuff happened last year. Weird stuff is going to happen this year. I might even get out from under...",
        "Marah: Out from under what?",
        "Jeffrey: Your other shoe is over there.",
        "Marah: Jeffrey...",
        "Jeffrey: No, no, Marah, I can't tell you, okay. I wish I could, but that's one thing I know will never happen.",
        "Josh: How's he doing?",
        "Ed: He's sleeping peacefully. His vital signs are strong.",
        "Josh: How long will he be out for?",
        "Ed: Could be awhile.",
        "Josh: Okay. Ed, has Michelle talked to you at all about Maryanne since the photograph came out in the newspaper?",
        "Ed: No, she hasn't made any connection. If she had, she'd be all over me. I just wish this would all fade away. But that's not going to happen, is it?",
        "Josh: I have an idea. If you talk to Billy or Buzz just let me know what they say, okay?",
        "Tammy: So what's with you today?",
        "Joey: I think you're amazingly great. And I'm glad we got together.",
        "Tammy: This is getting better.",
        "Joey: And I wanted to give you something.",
        "Tammy: Ooh, a present.",
        "Joey: Oh, man. Here.",
        "Tammy: Wow. Joey, it's your baseball ring.",
        "Joey: You can have it if you want.",
        "Tammy: Are you kidding? (Laughs) I would love to. This is great.",
        "Joey: Here. (Laughs) It's a little big, but it looks good. Not the most romantic presentation in the world, but least you got it on.",
        "Tammy: Did you just say \"presentation\"?",
        "Joey: Yeah, why?",
        "Tammy: Just sounds like something my Uncle Edmund would say. And this kind of looks like something he would carry around.",
        "Joey: Don't get mad at me, okay? I'm... I just wanted it to be great.",
        "Bill: Josh. Happy New Year.",
        "Josh: Hi, there. Happy New Year to you, too. Both of you.",
        "Eden: Thanks. I have to check on those arrangements for the shoot.",
        "Bill: Okay.",
        "Eden: Excuse me.",
        "Bill: Well, what's going on with you? You look like you've been up all night partying.",
        "Josh: Shayne had to have emergency surgery last night.",
        "Bill: Oh, he what?",
        "Josh: It went very well. I think he's going to be fine though.",
        "Bill: He's fine?",
        "Josh: Yeah.",
        "Bill: Good. Well, give him my best. And I will check in on him later. In the meantime, I'm sure you've got a lot on your mind. So don't worry about Lewis, because everything's under control over there.",
        "Josh: You mind if I sit down for just a second?",
        "Bill: Yeah, please. Come on, sit down.",
        "Josh: I wanted to talk to you about something. I'm glad you brought it up. I'm concerned that perhaps you're overextending yourself a little too much.",
        "Bill: What you mean with running Lewis and managing the campaign?",
        "Josh: Well, those are both full time jobs.",
        "Bill: Working twice as hard. I bet Mom would be proud.",
        "Josh: You work very hard and I appreciate that. But my real concern is for the company. I think maybe we're taking on too much work. And with too many crews that we don't know that don't have a proven track record with us. I'm not sure I feel comfortable with that.",
        "Bill: Josh, there's no need to worry. I mean we can handle it.",
        "Josh: Bill, Lewis Construction has been very successful. And part of the key to that success has been that we have not overextended the company. Now I want to keep it that way. I don't want you to take on any new projects or make any major changes unless I personally have signed off.",
        "Bill: All right, Josh, why did you ask me to step in for you over at Lewis? So you could focus on Shayne's recovery without any distractions. Well, you have that. And, yes, I am managing Danny campaign, but I think I've more than proven myself that I could run things over at Lewis. You know better than I that emergencies pop up all the time. What if something happens? We're going to stop everything to try to track you down? We can't do that. Now you can't expect me to run this operation then micromanage every step of the way. It's just... it's not going to work. Unless of course, you just don't trust me. Is that what's going here? Is this a trust issue?",
        "Josh: Bill...",
        "Bill: Because let me tell you, since I've filled in for you...",
        "Josh: Bill...",
        "Bill: The projects that...",
        "Josh: Just stop. I trust you. If I didn't trust you, you wouldn't be running the show. Now we can leave things the way they are for the time being. But I don't want you to be a cowboy. I don't want you losing my company.",
        "Bill: Of course not. In fact, I will copy you on every memo and I will fill you in on every detail the best I can. Listen, beyond that it's got to be my call, and that's for the company's sake.",
        "Josh: Okay.",
        "Eden: Tony, I asked Bill point blank. He's gotten no threats. But Mr. Machine knows somebody that's got something on him or Danny or both. And we got to find out who it is.",
        "Marah: Get out from under what? Your job? Being a lawyer?",
        "Jeffrey: You know, it's getting closer to afternoon every minute.",
        "Marah: Well, you should tell me. The sooner you tell me, the sooner I go.",
        "Jeffrey: Look, Marah, we're not going top spend the little bit of time we have left together talking about our stupid careers, are we?",
        "Marah: I'm not interested in that either.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, why do you keep asking?",
        "Marah: Doesn't it feel good to know that somebody cares about what makes you you?",
        "Jeffrey: I never thought about it before.",
        "Marah: How is that possible? I don't think it is. Because the way you looked at me last night and the way you touched me only a man with a whole world of feelings inside of him could have done that.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, it was just me.",
        "Marah: I liked him. The man you were last night. You're so much more than I expected.",
        "Jeffrey: No extra charge.",
        "Marah: Would it really be so bad to open up to me?",
        "Jeffrey: What am I suppose to just open up to you, right? Open my heart up to you. Pour out all my feelings. Is that what I'm supposed to do?",
        "Marah: I could stay the afternoon.",
        "Jeffrey: Marah, don't go looking for that man from last night. Because you'll never see him again.",
        "Tammy: So what's new in the world?",
        "Edmund: Hey, Tammy. Oh, everything. Nothing, you know, usual.",
        "Tammy: I don't know if I agree with the nothing part.",
        "Edmund: Why? Do you have some news?",
        "Tammy: Uh-uh. Nope. Just had breakfast with a bunch of baseball guys and their girlfriends. Pretty crazy.",
        "Jeffrey: Yes, I could I can only imagine.",
        "Tammy: We watched so many ball games, I can't even remember who played in them now.",
        "Edmund: Hmm. That's nice.",
        "Tammy: Uncle Edmund, do you know what's really romantic?",
        "Edmund: What?",
        "Tammy: When a guy makes a big fuss over you. I mean, what girl wouldn't love it if a guy decided to show how much he cared by giving her a super special gift and a sweet little speech to go along with it. Especially when she knows he planned the whole thing entirely by himself.",
        "Edmund: Hmm. Is that my handkerchief?",
        "Tammy: Is it? I was wondering how I got a hold of that.",
        "Edmund: Why, Tammy Winslow, what is that on your finger? My goodness, that is quite a ring. You didn't have that on when you left this morning.",
        "Tammy: Have you ever seen a baseball team ring before?",
        "Edmund: Why, no I never have.",
        "(Both laugh)",
        "Tammy: Nice try. And thank you.",
        "Edmund: My pleasure. Did Joey do me proud?",
        "Tammy: Proud enough.",
        "Cassie: Reva? Why didn't you call me the minute this happened?",
        "Reva: Well, because that's the way Shayne wanted it, you know, kind of low key.",
        "Cassie: Low key? He had surgery.",
        "Reva: Exactly. He didn't want to ruin everyone else's New Year's Eve.",
        "Cassie: I'm not everyone. I'm family. I'm your sister.",
        "Reva: Okay, okay. Are you finished?",
        "Cassie: How is he?",
        "Reva: He's still sleep. But Ed said that his vitals are strong. And we won't really know how the operation affected his overall condition for another day or so.",
        "Cassie: Poor kid. He's just been through so much. And so have you and Josh. How are you guys doing?",
        "Reva: We're okay. At least I'm not the one pushing us apart anymore. In fact, I'd like to be moving closer.",
        "Cassie: But Josh is pulling away.",
        "Reva: Josh, yeah. Yeah. I mean he just... you know, if it were up to me, I'd ask him to move back in today, but he doesn't seem to be ready for it.",
        "Cassie: That's so weird. You'd think he would be so relieved that you want to get closer to him.",
        "Reva: Yeah, yeah, you think.",
        "Cassie: So why? Why doesn't Josh want things to go back to normal?",
        "Reva: I don't know. I don't know, Cassie. It may be that I finally push him too far.",
        "Marah: Well...",
        "Jeffrey: Come here. Let me do that.",
        "Marah: You don't have to do that.",
        "Jeffrey: It's not a hardship.",
        "Marah: I will never forget last night. It was everything I wanted it to be. Except for the last part. Gift, right? And I shouldn't be greedy.",
        "Jeffrey: All I said was that it was a gift for both of us.",
        "Marah: Was it?",
        "Jeffrey: And there's nothing wrong with being greedy. Be greedy with life, Marah. You know, just go for it. Just take out a big chunk of it and go for it. That's what it's for. You're young.

        "Marah: Jeffrey.",
        "Jeffrey: Goodbye.",
        "Marah: (Crying)",
        "Desk Clerk: Ms. Lewis? You're mother left a message in case you showed up here. Your brother had emergency surgery.",
        "Marah: What?",
        "Desk Clerk: You should head to the hospital as soon as possible.",
        "Marah: Thank you.",
        "(Phone Ringing)",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah? Yeah, it's me. Who did you think I was? Well, what is it? Did you run the plates? And? Interesting. All right. I'll be right down there. Yeah, I know what day it is. You're working, aren't you? Okay, good. See you in a bit.",
        "Marah: Mom?",
        "Reva: Oh, Marah, honey, I'm so glad you're here.",
        "Marah: I'm sorry I didn't get here sooner.",
        "Reva: Yeah, we were trying to reach you all night last night.",
        "Marah: Yeah, I didn't have my phone on me. I just got your message. I just... I just got your message. Is Shayne okay?",

        "Marah: Are you serious? On his own?",
        "Reva: Yes, he... he was trying to walk again for Marina on Christmas Morning as a gift to her.",
        "Marah: Oh, Shayne.",
        "Reva: He fell off the parallel bars and bruised his back and fluid started to collect at the spot of the trauma, and it compressed the spine to point where he could barely even hold on to his own pencil.",
        "Marah: And surgery was the only option?",
        "Reva: Shayne didn't want to wait. Especially when he heard the surgeon talk about the fact that there could be a chance of radical improvement to his condition once the compression on his spine was released.",
        "Marah: What else was there a chance of?",
        "Reva: Permanent paralysis. But Ed said that the surgery went okay.",
        "Cassie: And his vitals are strong. Which is really good news.",
        "Reva: And all we could do is wait and pray for more of that.",
        "Marah: Dad's not here?",
        "Reva: He was. He went over to Company to get something to eat.",
        "Marah: Is he okay? Are you?",
        "Reva: Yeah. Yeah, we're hanging in.",
        "Marah: What about with each other? Are you okay?",
        "Reva: Well, that depends on who you ask. I mean, I think we're fine, but your father may not agree with that.",
        "Marah: Why not?",
        "Reva: Well, something is bothering him. I don't know what it is. It might be me. But whatever it is it's creating a problem.",
        "Marina: I think I told you already. But that band, On Track, didn't show up at the last minute, so Sandy dee-jayed. He was actually really great. I mean he was great. And everybody was up and dancing. And Nico and I... Nico and I were dancing, but I pretended that you were my real partner. I closed my eyes and I could almost see you right there in front of me. So we're going to have to go dancing when you get out of here. Which will be very soon. Because it is a new year. It's your year. And everything that you have been working so hard for is going to happen. I can feel it. I want it to. Hey. Hey.",
        "Shayne: (Mumbling)",
        "Marina: You had the surgery and they said it went fine. So you're not going to really know anything for a couple of days, but you're going to be great. And I'm going to be here with you, I promise.",
