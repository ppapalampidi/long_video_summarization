        "Harley: Cheers, Alexandra.",
        "Alexandra: Cheers, Harley.",
        "Harley: This is good. I mean, us getting together like this, catching up, like we used to before things got....",
        "Alexandra: Got very awkward.",
        "Harley: Exactly.",
        "Alexandra: You're right. You're right. It is good. It's good. And, well, since Gus is working for Spaulding and I'm seeing a great deal of your father... Well, hopefully, you and I can put all our misunderstandings on the shelf somewhere and move on.",
        "Harley: I would like that very much.",
        "Waiter: Here we go, ladies. And I'll be right back in a minute to tell you our specials.",
        "Harley: Thank you. Great. Just great.",
        "Alan: Olivia, you're a very good friend, visiting Phillip, offering to help around the office while he's gone, especially given what you've been through recently.",
        "Olivia: \"Good friend?\" You know, that's funny, Alan, because that's not what you said to me the other day when you practically ordered me to stay away from him.",
        "Alan: I apologize. I've been overly protective of Phillip. It's a parent's prerogative. Olivia, I have been concerned about you as well, and I still am.",
        "Olivia: Why is that?",
        "Alan: You and Phillip's relationship was over months ago and the child that you two share is no more, and there's no reason why you should be involved in his life anymore.",
        "Olivia: Except for my concern, Alan, as his friend.",
        "Alan: Phillip has friends and family, and I think it would be best if both of you moved on with your life. Perhaps even move away from Springfield. And I'll be happy to help you do that.",
        "Derek: All right.",
        "Danny: All right, next question.",
        "Derek: Okay. Marler supporters have made some insinuations about your integrity, alluded to your shady past, that sort of thing. Care to comment, Danny?",
        "Danny: Well, Derek, Ross Marler is a decent man and a worthy opponent and I will feel exactly the same way when he loses.",
        "Derek: All right.",
        "Danny: That's really all I can offer you. I appreciate you doing this on the fly with me, but I've got another appointment. Hey, there.",
        "Cassie: Hey.",
        "Danny: How are you?",
        "Cassie: So, Danny Santos running for mayor. Boy, who'd have thought that?",
        "Danny: I didn't even think that.",
        "Cassie: What are you doing here?",
        "Danny: I've got to do another interview. Hey, you're experienced in politics. You got any pointers for me?",
        "Cassie: Yeah.",
        "Danny: Yeah?",
        "Cassie: Watch everything you do or say because your life is on open book now.",
        "Danny: Oh, please, I'm learning it the hard way. You know, it's your fault I'm in this situation.",
        "Cassie: My fault? How is that?",
        "Danny: Because you believed in me, and you put your money where your mouth is. I've been able to go legit and turn my life around.",
        "Michelle: Three, two, one.",
        "Buzz: Hey, Michelle, are you coming or going?",
        "Michelle: Like you don't know. You know, it's interesting how you were outside of the drugstore when I was there today, same thing at the bank, and then again at the dry cleaners.",
        "Buzz: I guess you and I are running the same errands today.",
        "Michelle: At exactly the same time. Now here you are again, right behind me.",
        "Buzz: And here you are about to enter my restaurant. How about a cup of coffee? It's on me.",
        "Michelle: You're following me, Buzz:. And I don't like it. It's an invasion of my privacy.",
        "Buzz: Well, then, I guess you know how your father feels about the way you've been treating him.",
        "Michelle: So you and my dad have been comparing notes, huh? With Josh and Billy and Alan, too?",
        "Buzz: What do you hope to accomplish with this search-and-destroy mission. What is your ultimate goal? To destroy your father's life, to push him back into the bottle?",
        "Michelle: We just want you guys to tell the truth, just to admit what happened all those years ago when Alan's car went off the bridge, and we'll help you make peace with it.",
        "Buzz: You want to help?! Drop it! Let it go, like your father's been begging you to. You don't know what you're starting here. I know you're the ringleader here. Marah and Marina take their cue off of you. But when all the damage comes home to roost, the fallout's going to be an your ass!",
        "Ed: Enough.",
        "Cassie: So everything's that's good that's happening to you in the past year has been because of me.",
        "Danny: Not everything, but close.",
        "Cassie: I don't think so.",
        "Danny: You know, I hope you don't mind that you haven't exactly been receiving credit for that.",
        "Cassie: You're giving me credit now.",
        "Danny: I know. I mean publicly, because you and I both know that the only reason the Fifth Street Project got off the ground was because of your name and your good reputation. The only reason we got that government loan was because of you. But, lately, for some reason, everybody seems to be associating the project entirely with me.",
        "Cassie: That's because you've been out there promoting it.",
        "Danny: And I've been getting all the credit for it. But, just so you know, we did this thing 50/50.",
        "Cassie: Financially.",
        "Danny: Not just...",
        "Cassie: You're doing most of the work. That's okay. That's the way we set it up from the beginning. Look, this place is a full-time job for me and I would like to spend some time with my kids, so...",
        "Danny: What? You mean now you want a personal life?",
        "Cassie: Call me crazy, but yes. (Laughs)",
        "Danny: So you really don't mind that I've been getting all this attention from the Project?",
        "Cassie: No. Not at all. I just hope you finish the Project because when you take office, if you get elected, you're not going to be able to do both.",
        "Danny: Wait, if I get elected? You don't think I'm a shoe-in?",
        "Cassie: Oh, man.",
        "Danny: I'm just teasing, I know Ross is a great guy and a great, worthy candidate and his wife is your best friend, so I'm....",
        "Cassie: You're putting me in an awkward position.",
        "Danny: I'm not going to force you to say who you're going to vote for. Your friendship, our friendship, means a lot more than any political endorsement. Just don't endorse Ross.",
        "Cassie: Oh, get out of here.",
        "Danny: My meeting's here; I've got to go.",
        "Cassie: See you later.",
        "Jeffrey: Good day, Mrs. Winslow.",
        "Cassie: Good day, Mr. O'Neill. Busy day?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, it's not too busy to compliment you. Yeah, I'd like to compliment you on how well you just handled Danny Santos.",
        "Olivia: So, you just want to get rid of me. I mean, if my baby had lived, I would have been welcome around your dinner table, but now I'm not even fit to live in the same town. Now just cut to the chase, Alan. What's your offer? And I only accept cash.",
        "Alan: There's no need to be cynical.",
        "Olivia: I just know you. When you say \u0091help' it means money.",
        "Alan: All I said was there's nothing holding you in Springfield now.",
        "Olivia: Except for my business, my new friendships.",
        "Alan: Which you were already willing to forego. No, the only thing tying to you to this area and to my family is your interest in Spaulding Enterprises.",
        "Olivia: Wild guess: you want to buy me out?",
        "Alan: At a very generous price. Something that will set you up very comfortably.",
        "Olivia: Why now, Alan? Why is it so important that you want me out of the way?",
        "Alan: Don't misconstrue what I've been telling you today, Olivia.",
        "Olivia: No, I know you. This is you pulling up the drawbridge and bracing yourself for a fight. The question is: with whom and over what? I don't suppose this has anything to do with Phillip's competency, does it?",
        "Alan: I'll tell you what, I will have my lawyers contact you with a number and we'll take it from there.",
        "Olivia: Alrighty. You go ahead and give me your best offer. But I can't promise you anything.",
        "Alan: I'll get the ball rolling.",
        "Phillip #2: Yes?",
        "Phillip #3: I'm an attorney, Mr. Spaulding. I have been retained to investigate your competency. Please take a seat.",
        "Phillip #2: I'm already sitting.",
        "Phillip #3: The question is whether or not you're crazy. Now, do you think you're crazy?",
        "Phillip #2: No. Of course not. No.",
        "Phillip #3: But other people may not share that opinion. See, it says here that you stole your father's wife, got her pregnant, then allowed your teenaged daughter to push said pregnant lover down a flight of stairs. Do you have any comment?",
        "Phillip #2: Well...",
        "Phillip #3: I thought so. Now, Phillip, what would you say is the most important thing in your life?",
        "Phillip #2: My family, I guess.",
        "Phillip #3: You guess?",
        "Phillip #2: No, my family, yes.",
        "Phillip #3: All right. Now when you say \"family,\" do you mean the family that you abandoned with Beth or Harley?",
        "Phillip #2: I didn't abandon...",
        "Phillip #3: Or are you referring to the family that you most recently rejected with Alan and Alexandra?",
        "Phillip #2: What are you writing there?",
        "Phillip #3: Answers.",
        "Phillip #2: I haven't given you any.",
        "Phillip #3: Which leads me to my next question. Why are you being so evasive?",
        "Phillip #2: I'm not.",
        "Phillip #3: Why are you hiding from the world, Phillip?",
        "Phillip #2: I'm sick.",
        "Phillip #3: What are you hoping to gain from all this? What do you really want? (Echoing) What do you really want?",
        "Michelle: Dad...",
        "Ed: I know you're tense, but don't take it out on Michelle.",
        "Michelle: You mean the way you did?",
        "Buzz: Then tell then tell her to stop hounding us.",
        "Michelle: Excuse me? You're the one who was following me. How does this work, exactly? What, do you guys take turns? Who's following Marah and Marina right now, huh?",
        "Ed: Please, Michelle, enough.",
        "Michelle: If you guys think I'm going to lead you to anything, you've got another thing coming.",
        "Buzz: No, we know you won't on your own. But when you meet this person, it's sort of a package deal, isn't it? It's got to be you, Marina, and Marah together or no dice, right?",
        "Cassie: Okay, first of all, you were eavesdropping on my conversation with Danny Santos?",
        "Jeffrey: I was sitting over there reading, minding my own business, and you were speaking in your... well, in your normal tone, so I couldn't help but overhear.",
        "Cassie: Enough to get the impression that I'm somehow handling Danny?",
        "Jeffrey: I just said you were being smart, that's all.",
        "Cassie: I'm flattered.",
        "Jeffrey: You're working with Dan Santos on the Fifth Street Project, right? And you've managed to keep it on the QT all this time. It's remarkable. And you're reaping all of these financial rewards without any of the down side. That's great.",
        "Cassie: There is no down side.",
        "Jeffrey: Right. Okay. Whatever. I'm off. Have a nice day.",
        "Cassie: There is no down side, Jeffrey.",
        "Jeffrey: Jeffrey? Did you just call me Jeffrey?",
        "Cassie: Look, okay, obviously you wanted to have this conversation for a reason. So, if you have something to say or something on your mind, spit it out.",
        "Harley: I'd like to propose a toast.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, I thought you already did.",
        "Harley: Another one. This one is to the mysteries of the heart.",
        "Alexandra: How poetic.",
        "Harley: Well, whoever thought I'd see my father enjoying being Spaulding eye candy. That's a mystery, huh? But whatever works for you, right?",
        "Alexandra: Oh, come on, I'm hardly dragging him to nothing but charity balls.",
        "Harley: It's actually him dragging you around on his motorcycle.",
        "Alexandra: Okay. We have fun. No harm in that.",
        "Harley: No, no. No harm at all. And, hey, at least my dad is better for you than some of the guys you've been with, right? And for starters, he's single. I mean, Brad Green? I have to say, I was really surprised to hear that. Alexandra, I thought you were smarter than that.",
        "Alexandra: Well, so what I've heard is right. Have you gotten cozy with Brad Green?",
        "Harley: No, not that cozy. We just cross paths at the gym sometimes.",
        "Alexandra: Just close enough to, well, share a few personal tidbits?",
        "Harley: Does that bother you?",
        "Alexandra: I think it might bother Brad Green's wife, I don't know.",
        "Harley: But not you? No, because Brad's your... he's your go-to guy, right? Even after he went to the Spaulding coffers and embezzled hundreds of thousands of dollars. I mean, most people wouldn't want somebody like that on their payroll, but you do. I've got to tell you, Alexandra, I am dying to know why.",
        "Phillip #3: What do you want? What do you want, Phillip? If you could have anything in the world, what would it be?",
        "Phillip #2: I don't know.",
        "Phillip #3: I'm sorry. There's no box on this form for that.",
        "Phillip #2: Well, write it down, anyway, damn it, because it's how I feel!",
        "Phillip #3: So now you're defending yourself, you're fighting back, thinking outside the box. That's interesting. Is that part of the plan?",
        "Phillip #2: What plan?",
        "Phillip #3: Your plan. You do have a plan?",
        "Phillip #2: No. I don't have a plan. I don't want a plan! Plans are what put me here in the first place! I don't want... I don't want any of it anymore. All I want is to just be. I want to love and be loved. To hell with control! And if that makes me nuts, so be it.",
        "Alan: Phillip? Phillip?",
        "Christopher: Olivia?",
        "Olivia: Hi.",
        "Christopher: Hi. Have you been in to see Phillip?",
        "Olivia: No, not yet. After Alan. What's going on with him, Christopher? Why does he seem so out of it?",
        "Christopher: He was out of it this morning, so we gave him a mild sedative. It's probably making him groggy.",
        "Olivia: Well, why was he agitated? Was he upset about something?",
        "Christopher: No, no, I just think he's wrestling with a lot right now. But, generally, he's on the mend?",
        "Olivia: He's on the mend? Really?",
        "Christopher: You seem surprised.",
        "Olivia: Well, no. I mean, I hoped. But the way Alan and everyone else is talking, it's like... Look, you know that he's technically still CEO of Spaulding, and he has enormous responsibilities. Alan is filling in for him for now, but eventually a decision will have to be made.",
        "Christopher: You're talking about the issue of competency. That's really a legal matter, Olivia. Someone from the family would have to start an inquiry, papers would have to be filed.",
        "Olivia: You mean Alan hasn't take than step yet?",
        "Christopher: Not to my knowledge, no.",
        "Olivia: Well, let's say that he does. I mean, there would have to be a hearing, right, and you would have to give your opinion on Phillip's mental state?",
        "Christopher: Most likely, yes.",
        "Olivia: Well, what would you say?",
        "Christopher: Well, a while back when Phillip was having delusions, my response would have been different. But, now, today, I'd say that Phillip was still clinically depressed, but, in my opinion, he's no longer psychotic.",
        "Olivia: In layman's terms that means he knows the difference between what's real and what isn't?",
        "Christopher: Basically, yes. He's capable of rational thought and he's making decisions on his own behalf.",
        "Olivia: Okay. If he's better, then why isn't he acting more like himself? Why is he so unresponsive?",
        "Christopher: I think it's easier for him to be this way. He's protecting himself and healing himself. But I also am quite sure that he can understand everything that's being said to him, whether he shows it or not.",
        "Alan: Oh, Son, I wish I knew what you were thinking inside your head right now. Are you afraid, or are you at peace with yourself?",
        "Buzz: Why don't you tell us the whole story? We're going to find out eventually.",
        "Michelle: You are focusing on the wrong thing. It doesn't matter who told me what or when.",
        "Buzz: Why?",
        "Michelle: The question is what are you going to do about it or what should you do about it?",
        "Buzz: Don't you wonder why?",
        "Michelle: What?",
        "Buzz: Why this person, this witness, suddenly made themselves known to you, and started to fill your heads with all this garbage?",
        "Michelle: You know, I wish that it was garbage.",
        "Buzz: It is.",
        "Ed: Michelle, this is why we have to know who the person is, so we can defend ourselves. I mean, that's our right, isn't it?",
        "Carrie: A woman is dead. She has been dead and safely buried for 30 years. Until I came back and dug her up. What do you think these men might do to me if they ever thought she would not remain safely buried?",
        "Alexandra: Well, my, my, my, my, my. You're gracious enough to accept my invitation for lunch, but all you seem to want to do is ask questions about Brad Green. You know, if I didn't know you better, Harley, I would say you were somehow on the job -- you know, just looking to investigate something.",
        "Harley: Oh, I turned in my badge, Alexandra.",
        "Alexandra: Traded it for a PI's license. I wonder, do Harley's Angels, do your little partners know anything about what you're up to?",
        "Harley: \"What I'm up to?\"",
        "Alexandra: Oh, yes. Your assignment. Well, come on. You are checking on your fianc\u00e9e, aren't you? Seeing what he can dig up about Spaulding, finding out where he fits in, you know, wondering whether or not it's going to be permanent.",
        "Harley: Permanence is not an issue.",
        "Alexandra: Well, I don't know. Alan would love for him to stick around.",
        "Harley: Well, Gus won't.",
        "Alexandra: Are you so sure? Seems to me he's taken quite a liking to these corporate waters. As a matter of fact, I think he's... well, I'd say he's downright gung-ho.",
        "Harley: For the short term.",
        "Alexandra: Mm-hmm.",
        "Harley: He's having some fun. But Gus is blue to his bones.",
        "Alexandra: Well, Alan, I know, always wants a son around in that office, and since Phillip seems to be so out of commission these days...",
        "Harley: Gus will be back on the force in a week or two, Alexandra.",
        "Alexandra: Unless, of course, Alan convinces him otherwise.",
        "Harley: No way. Being a cop is all Gus has ever wanted.",
        "Alexandra: Harley, sorry to say, but really, you've been around long enough. You've seen the Spauldings in action long enough to know that it's never about what anyone else wants. It's always about what Alan wants.",
        "Alan: I hope you're not afraid, Son, because I'm looking out for you. I'm not going to let Olivia upset you ever again.",
        "Christopher: You know, Olivia, you've been very important to Phillip's recovery.",
        "Olivia: Oh, yeah. Especially after I put him in here in the first place.",
        "Christopher: That wasn't you, Olivia. It was an unfortunate combination of circumstances. Lizzie's illness, his intense pressure at work...",
        "Olivia: Topped off by me.",
        "Christopher: The point is that Phillip still loves you very much. When you came back into town and you told him the truth about the baby, that was really the turning point for him. It set him on the road to recovery. You understand him better than anyone else can.",
        "Olivia: Yes, I do. And I intend to look out for him now.",
        "Jeffrey: No, Mrs. Winslow, I really don't have anything else to say. I've said all that I wanted to say. Remind me never to pay you a compliment again.",
        "Cassie: That wasn't a compliment.",
        "Jeffrey: I told you I thought you were smart.",
        "Cassie: You meant that I was shrewd.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, what's wrong with shrewd?",
        "Cassie: Shrewd borders calculating, which borders devious, and right around the corner from dishonest.",
        "Jeffrey: It's truly amazing how your mind works.",
        "Cassie: I repeat: if you have something to say, then just say it.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay. Maybe you should know about this anyway. There's word on the street that there's a turf war brewing here locally with some out of town mob guys and their counterparts here in Springfield.",
        "Cassie: Okay, I really don't see how that has anything to do with me or Danny. He's clean.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, no one said that he wasn't.",
        "Cassie: Yeah? Well, you're implying it.",
        "Jeffrey: No. But you know no matter how hard that Danny has worked to disassociate himself from the mob, there are always going to be some people who either, A: doubt that he's really out, or B: see him as a threat now that he is. I'm just saying that you're smart. You're being really smart to distance yourself from him and not publicize your partnership with him, and especially staying out of that campaign. I think it's just really smart, and I meant smart in the true sense of the word. That's all.",
        "Cassie: So, you're looking out for me. You're protecting me. You're watching out for me, huh?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, I feel that we have established a certain connection, yeah, and I don't want to see you get hurt.",
        "Cassie: Well, that's big of you.",
        "Jeffrey: What is with you today?",
        "Cassie: What's with me?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah.",
        "Cassie: I don't like being patronized, and I don't like being told that I'm smart because I'm doing something that you might approve of.",
        "Jeffrey: For once.",
        "Cassie: Because tomorrow I'll probably do something that you don't approve of. And, boy, won't you have egg on your face then?",
        "Jeffrey: No, you will.",
        "Cassie: Oh, look. There's Derek Mosley. He works for The Journal. Perfect timing. Excuse me. Hi there, Mr. Mosley. Hi. I'm Cassie Winslow. You're the reporter who's covering Danny Santos' campaign, right?",
        "Derek: Yes.",
        "Cassie: I have a statement to make.",
        "Michelle: Why are you doing this?",
        "Buzz: Why are we?",
        "Michelle: You're only making it worse. You should just admit it. Just admit the...",
        "Danny: How are you all doing? What's going on? What's up?",
        "Ed: Nothing.",
        "Michelle: Oh, it's just... we're having a silly argument about something that we read in the paper.",
        "Buzz: Listen, you guys carry on. I've got to go inside. There are repairs to make. I'm going to close the restaurant early. Stop by before you go?",
        "Ed: Okay.",
        "Danny: What's going on? What article?",
        "Michelle: Like I said, it was silly. Hey, do you want to join me for some coffee? Do you have time?",
        "Danny: All right, you know what? You guys, it really does not take a genius to see all the tension that there has been between the two of you lately. Now, what's going on? Does it have to do with me, or are you still not thrilled about the fact I'm running for mayor?",
        "Ed: No, no. That's not the problem. Look, there is no problem.",
        "Danny: Okay. Okay. Well, then for future reference, if something comes up and there are any differences in opinion, can we just try to discuss it and keep it between ourselves?",
        "Michelle: Of course. Of course. Why?",
        "Danny: Okay.",
        "Michelle: Why? What's going on?",
        "Danny: Well, there have been some rumblings on the street that there might be some difficulty with some of the other families. And I mean, I'm not involved in that anymore, but my name could very easily get dragged into it, and we all know that would not help me get elected.",
        "Ed: Look, Ross is not going to take advantage of that. I mean, he's not going to purposely spread lies about you.",
        "Danny: Oh, I know. I know. But since you mentioned it, I know Ross is your friend, and you have certain obligations to him.",
        "Ed: Well, I have obligations to you, too. I know what's at stake here.",
        "Danny: Okay. Thanks.",
        "Ed: We both do.",
        "Buzz: Josh, it's me. Grab Billy and come down to Company. We have to talk. And this time let's leave Alan out of it.",
        "Cassie: So, not only am I Danny Santos' business partner, I am a very good friend, and I have a lot of admiration and respect for Danny, and I think he will make a wonderful mayor for Springfield. In fact, I plan on throwing a very big party for Danny the night of the election. And I hope he'll be capping of the evening with his acceptance speech. So, that's all I have to say.",
        "Derek: Thank you very much, Mrs. Winslow.",
        "Cassie: Thank you.",
        "Derek: Thank you.",
        "Jeffrey: Wow. I hope you didn't just make that public endorsement of Danny Santos for my benefit.",
        "Cassie: No, but you did help me with the decision, you know? I do love Ross, but Danny is a very good friend of mine, and I think he'll be a great mayor, and that's why I did it.",
        "Jeffrey: Just so long as, you know, you didn't do that to get back at me.",
        "Cassie: Get over yourself.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay. Well, you learn something every day, and today I learned something new about you. Yeah. If anyone wants to get you to do something, all they have to do is suggest that you do the opposite, and... (Whistles) You're off to the races.",
        "Cassie: You're telling me that you wanted me to talk to that reporter?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah.",
        "Cassie: To endorse Danny?",
        "Jeffrey: Mm-hmm.",
        "Cassie: Why?",
        "Jeffrey: Because I think Danny would make a wonderful mayor.",
        "Cassie: Do you know why I do the exact opposite of everything you say? Because you are so full of...",
        "Jeffrey: Shh. Mrs. Winslow, please, you know, your children might be in the vicinity.",
        "Cassie: And to think I was starting to like you. Why don't you ask me to stay, Mr. O'Neill?",
        "Jeffrey: What?",
        "Cassie: Ask me to stay.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay. Will you stay, Mrs. Winslow?",
        "Cassie: Oh, dear. I have to be contrary.",
        "Alan: Doctor, I thought you told me that Phillip was getting better.",
        "Christopher: You don't agree?",
        "Alan: He didn't even acknowledge my presence now.",
        "Olivia: Sounds pretty healthy to me. Can I go and see him now?",
        "Alan: By all means.",
        "Olivia: Thank you. Bye, Alan.",
        "Alan: Olivia, my people will contact you about the matter we discussed.",
        "Olivia: I'm sure they will. Phillip? Hi. Hi. Oh. I think Christopher's right. I think, you can hear me, and you can understand what I'm saying. You're just... you don't feel the need to talk right now. That's okay, as long as you can understand. Listen to me. There's something I need to discuss with you. It's an idea that I have. I'm worried about you, and I feel at least partially responsible for putting you here, so I'm hoping that you'll let me make it up to you by agreeing to something that I know is going to help you. It's going to help us both, actually. Phillip, will you let me do that? Will you let me help you, please?",
        "Billy: So, Josh tells me that we're leaving Alan out of this powwow. Why is that?",
        "Buzz: Because Alan's interests and ours aren't the same anymore.",
        "Billy: How so?",
        "Buzz: Well, whoever's been snooping around us wants to get at us through your children and my grandchild. Alan's family is conspicuously out of the mix.",
        "Billy: Well, maybe they just know that Lizzie doesn't have all her marbles.",
        "Ed: Well, for whatever reason, Buzz is right. We've got something at stake in the situation, and Alan doesn't.",
        "Josh: There's still one question out there: why did this person come after us through these girls and not come after us directly?",
        "Billy: They knew they'd spook us more this way.",
        "Buzz: No, I think there's another reason.",
        "Ed: Buzz has a theory. Unfortunately, it makes a certain amount of sense.",
        "Billy: Okay, let's have it, Buzz.",
        "Buzz: It has to do with the second note. I think it means something different than what we originally thought. \"Gentlemen, it's been almost 30 years. You never paid your debt. Now you will.\"",
        "Billy: So?",
        "Buzz: What is our debt?",
        "Billy: Our debt to society.",
        "Buzz: Could be. But what if you read it differently? What if you interpreted it biblically, like, \"An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth?\" What is the price for a life taken? Another life.",
        "Ed: What is the ultimate way to make us suffer? Worse than going to prison? Worse than any punishment that we could possibly endure?",
        "Josh: This person wants to take away our children.",
        "Olivia: Oh, thank you. Thank you for trusting me. I do care about you, and I just want to make things right for us. Listen. You remember, before I left town, you asked me a question? We were at the waterfront, and you were confused and upset. You were trying to put your life back together, and you reached out to me. You asked me something very, very important. Do you remember? Well, I held you off then, but I have an answer for you now. The answer is yes, Phillip, if you still want to marry me. I would be honored to be your wife. Do you really still want that, Phillip? Do you want to marry me?",
        "Josh: Who would do this? Who would be so blinded by revenge and so full of hatred that...",
        "Alan: That's what we have to find out.",
        "Ed: What's he doing here?",
        "Billy: I called him.",
        "Josh: Why?",
        "Alan: Because your brother is a realist, Josh. He's not afraid to admit the truth.",
        "Ed: Which is what?",
        "Alan: That you need me. You know, every one of you has convinced yourself that I'm the amoral member of the group because I put the drug in the beer that night and convinced every one of you of keeping quiet about the outcome. But, gentlemen, I'm not the bad one here, because, don't forget, you all walked away from the river that night and left Maryanne Caruthers dead and forgotten.",
        "Ed: Forgotten until now.",
        "Alan: Yes, until now, Ed. Thirty years later. You never had any complaints for 30 years. You never complained when you became Chief of Staff of Cedars. Buzz, when you came back to town and found peace with your family, you didn't complain at all. Josh has raised two wonderful children, a very successful business, without complaining once. And now, 30 years later, you're begging me to come clean and tell the truth. Well, you know what the truth is. Because I protected every one of you that night. And deep down, you still want me to protect you.",
        "Josh: Hey!",
        "Alan: But I am not.",
        "Josh: Hey! What are you doing? Give me that.",
        "Billy: Oh, wait! Wait, whoa! I got your attention, Josh. Good. Alan is right. We are going to have to make a decision, a choice. And believe me, this choice is ugly. But it is the right choice.",
        "Alan: Billy's told me your theory about the person who is after us is trying to get to us by hurting your daughters and Marina. Well, I think the time for inaction is over, gentlemen, because we have to find this person.",
        "Ed: And then what?",
        "Alan: Get rid of him.",
        "Carrie: Hello. Hello. I believe we met some years ago in Paris. We traveled in some of the same circles, had some of the same friends. Well, I think it's time to renew our acquaintance. I have a story to tell you that I think you'll find very interesting.",
        "Buzz: Next on Guiding Light...",
        "Bill: What was that?",
        "Eden: No! Don't go!",
        "Jeffrey: You're not going to believe this, but a big piece of the puzzle just fell into my lap. I think it's time you pay us a visit."
