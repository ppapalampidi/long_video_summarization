        "Bill asks Liam if he smoked something before he came in here. This is his business. Liam says he cannot be trusted so Bill can just step down and he will take it from here. Nicole tells Zende she is really impressed by his accomplishments and the whole family believes in him. And she can be his main model. Rick tells Maya that he is not against it, but surprised that she wants to ship her sister away to Paris to work to keep her away from Lizzy. He knows it has nothing to do with Zende getting the job there. She says call it mother's intuition but yes it bothers her when she hears Lizzy call Nicole mama. Rick says there is one little problem. Sasha is in Paris modeling. Maya says no problem as now Zende is 100% committed to Nicole. She hopes he will tell Ridge and see what he thinks. Bill tells Liam that the only person taking a leave of absence is Liam as he is fired. Liam retorts that he would not do that as he could go to the police. Bill should know how many years he will get for arson. Steffy tells Ridge that Liam can be pushed into a corner and be very unforgiving but she does not want him to sever ties with his father. She leaves just as Maya and Rick walk in so they talk to Ridge. They propose it would be a good thing to send Zende and Nicole to Paris where they are needed now. Ridge says he loves Paris himself but he thought it was working out for Zende here. He'll have to talk to Zende and Nicole and see how they feel about this.",
        "Liam tells Bill that he has always respected him but he needs to stop lying. He comments that Spectra won fair and square in the last showing and that was a dirty little trick and now the latest one, the fire. He is ashamed of him. Bill has everything, so much, so just what is it that he wants? Bill says he cannot break out Freud now and analyze him. Then he says okay, big deal, so Spectra won but he will not be blackmailed by his own son now. Sally drops in on Steffy and says she just wants to say goodbye. Steffy is surprised but Sally says Thomas is in New York and she lost Spectra so there is nothing left for her here. She also is sorry for the things she did to Steffy and wants to apologize to her. Bill mocks Liam that he wants more power and can unseat his own dad. The police cannot trace that fire back to him. He loves Liam and he trusted him but looks like that was a big mistake. Liam continues to push and gets Bill to grandstand. Bill announces okay, he got Justin to find someone to set fire to Spectra. So now Liam can be satisfied and they can move on. Liam turns his back and Bill asks what he is doing. Liam replies he is e-mailing himself so he won't lose this. He plays the repeat of what Bill just said \u0096 gotcha! Ridge speaks with Zende and Nicole and says he has a great opportunity for them if they would like to move to Paris and work at International. Sally tells Steffy that she knows she has been nothing but a royal pain in the butt and she'd like her to accept this peace offering. She wants her to have her sketches, the ones that did not get destroyed in the fire. In another lifetime perhaps they could have been friends. Bill is stunned that Liam would stoop so low to record him. Is this what he thinks he has to do to defend Sally Spectra. He's got it now; Liam has a thing for her! Liam argues with him that he has put the entire company and the family in jeopardy. He is the new leadership and it is time. Bill says Liam has lost his mind. Liam says at 9 o'clock tomorrow morning he becomes the new CEO and this is his desk now."

        "Bill: Did you smoke something before you came in here? Do you fully comprehend what you're asking me to do?",
        "Liam: I'm not asking.",
        "Bill: This is my business. My company.",
        "Liam: And if you're lucky, you'll get to hold onto it.",
        "Bill: Have you lost your freakin' mind?",
        "Liam: No. You have. Over a stupid building.",
        "Bill: That's the way things work sometimes, liam. It ain't always pretty.",
        "Liam: Oh, please. Stop, stop, stop, stop. I'm not gonna let you normalize this. You are dangerous. You cannot be trusted. So step down, take a leave of absence, and I'll take it from here.",
        "Ridge: Liam shouldn't be afraid of his father.",
        "Steffy: Bill is pretty intimidating.",
        "Ridge: He's not intimidating. He's just an overgrown bully. He wants what he wants.",
        "Steffy: And liam's not gonna stand for that much longer.",
        "Ridge: Well, that's a good thing, right?",
        "Steffy: I'm not sure.",
        "Nicole: I'm incredibly proud of you, baby. You're really coming into your own as a designer -- getting the recognition from ridge and the rest of the family...",
        "Zende: It's an honor. Really. You know, I'm just grateful that I've been able to get a shot to prove myself.",
        "Nicole: Well, there's nothing my man can't do.",
        "Zende: Damn right. But now the pressure's on, so...",
        "Nicole: And I'm behind you. The whole family believes in you. I can't wait to see what the future brings.",
        "Rick: You want to send zende and your sister to paris?",
        "Maya: You don't like the idea?",
        "Rick: No, it's -- [ Laughs ] I'm just surprised, that's all.",
        "Maya: Everyone has been talking about strengthening the international office. With jean-luc leaving, this would be an amazing opportunity for zende to grow as a young designer.",
        "Rick: But be straight with me, maya. This isn't about helping zende's career. This is about shipping your sister to europe to keep her away from our daughter.",
        "Zende: I already have ideas for the spring line. If ridge lets me collaborate, that is.",
        "Nicole: Well, I can't imagine why he wouldn'T.",
        "Zende: So... are you gonna be my main model?",
        "Nicole: I'm your main everything.",
        "Zende: [ Chuckles ]",
        "Nicole: Of course I will get up on that runway for you. Anytime. But only -- only for you.",
        "Zende: Good. It's a great feeling, knowing that everyone has my back around here. Come here.",
        "[ Both laugh ]",
        "Maya: It'll be a new and exciting adventure for them. It's paris! And, yes, it will create some much-needed distance between nicole and lizzy during this very crucial stage of her development. I love my sister. You want to call it mother's intuition, fine. But seeing lizzy call nicole \"mommy\" after everything that's happened was very upsetting.",
        "Rick: I know. I know. I didn't mean to make you feel bad about it. That -- I think you're right. This would be a legitimate career move for zende. We just have to run it by ridge first.",
        "Maya: Yeah, of course. Of course.",
        "Rick: There is one other problem. Your sister sasha. She's living and modeling in paris.",
        "Maya: Zende is 100% committed to nicole. There's nothing to worry about. You know I want the best for zende and nicole. Of course! Truly I do! I just want the best for us, too, and for lizzy. This is a great opportunity for zende. Let's talk to ridge and see what he thinks.",
        "Steffy: Liam just wants more influence at spencer publications. He wants to use his position to do something good in this world.",
        "Ridge: Well, bill's not gonna allow any of that.",
        "Steffy: [ Sighs ] You'd be surprised. Bill has a lot to gain by listening to liam.",
        "Bill: You got a lot of nerve, kid. I can appreciate that. Under other circumstances. But you've overstepped. You crossed the line. The only person taking a leave of absence is you. You're fired.",
        "Liam: Yeah, you can't do that.",
        "Bill: I just did. Get out.",
        "Liam: I really didn't want it to come to this but...",
        "Bill: Out!",
        "Liam: I will call the police and tell them what you've done.",
        "Bill: You don't have it in you.",
        "Liam: Arson, dad. Do you know how many years you get for arson?",
        "Steffy: Liam wants his dad to be better. He knows that there's a different side to him.",
        "Ridge: Well, people don't change, especially people like bill spencer.",
        "Steffy: [ Sighs ] Liam's hoping he can make an impact. I just don't want him to push his dad too much. Bill doesn't like to be backed into a corner, and he can be very unforgiving. I just don't want him to ruin his relationship with his dad.",
        "Ridge: All right, my advice, tell liam to lower his expectations where his father is concerned. Otherwise, he's gonna walk through life disappointed.",
        "Steffy: Yeah. Yeah. Maybe you're right. Well, I have to get back to work. I have a conference call. Oh!",
        "Rick: Steffy. We were just coming to speak to you and ridge about something.",
        "Steffy: Oh, whatever it is, I'm sure my dad can handle it. I have a call.",
        "Maya: Okay. Bye.",
        "Ridge: What's up?",
        "Rick: Wanted to run something by you.",
        "Ridge: Okay.",
        "Maya: We know how well zende's doing as a designer.",
        "Rick: And he did such a great job in monaco.",
        "Ridge: Yeah...",
        "Maya: Well, we were thinking that, you know, europe is invaluable for young designers, especially paris.",
        "Rick: And I've been working in international for a long time now, and...",
        "Ridge: And -- and what?",
        "Rick: And we were thinking it would be great if we sent zende and nicole to paris!",
        "Nicole: I can already see our future.",
        "Zende: Oh, you're a psychic now?",
        "Nicole: Yes. I am.",
        "Zende: Okay.",
        "Nicole: You and I are gonna be back here, getting ready for your first full showing. And the audience will be cheering and chanting your name. Reporters and buyers from all over the world will be here for you. For your designs. And then, you know, me wearing them, model extraordinaire.",
        "Zende: [ Chuckles ] I wouldn't have it any other way.",
        "Nicole: [ Gasps, giggles ]",
        "Liam: I've always respected you. You know that.",
        "Bill: [ Chuckles ] You got a strange way of showing it, threatening me with jail time. Never thought I'd hear that from my own flesh and blood.",
        "Liam: So stop. Really simple. You just...stop lying. You know, it's interesting, i actually went back and I took a look at the code that was used on the spencer summit app. It was pretty weak, pretty easy to access. I tallied the votes. Spectra won. Now, you said it was a tie. But spectra won fair and square.",
        "Bill: It was -- it was for charity! Who gives a damn?",
        "Liam: It was a dirty little trick, one of many that you've pulled at that family's expense, except this last one, this most recent one... I have no words. Only shame.",
        "Bill: Then I guess we're done here, aren't we?",
        "Liam: When is it gonna be enough? What is it that you want? You have so much. You have brooke and buildings and cars and homes and billions of dollars, and it's not enough. What void are you trying to fill?",
        "Bill: All right, give me a break, dr. Freud. You gonna psychoanalyze me now?",
        "Liam: You just take and take and take and take. This is what you do! You can't even let spectra win a charity fashion showdown! You can't even admit that they won.",
        "Bill: Okay! They won. Spectra won the fashion showdown! Whoo! There! Are you happy? I don't want to hide anything from you. In fact, you -- you came up with some good ideas. And maybe we'll try to implement some of them around here. But I will not be blackmailed. Do you hear me? I will not be blackmailed by my own son!",
        "Steffy: Okay. Okay. We'll look at the offer and we'll get back to you. Okay. Bye-bye. Sally.",
        "Sally: Hi, uh, pam said you were in here. Is this a good time?",
        "Steffy: Uh, yeah. Yeah, sure. What's up?",
        "Sally: Well, I... I know you're busy, so I won't be long. I, um... I just wanted to say goodbye.",
        "Maya: Paris is the epicenter of fashion. What better place for zende to hone his craft?",
        "Ridge: I love paris, but i thought zende was working out here. What am I missing?",
        "Rick: You're not missing anything. He's doing a fantastic job. I just thought it'd be a great addition to the international office if zende went over there. We both know jean-luc -- he announced last week that he's leaving. Zende could stay on if it happens to be the right fit.",
        "Ridge: And?",
        "Maya: And nicole would be a huge asset to our pr department. She could beef up our marketing campaigns. She could be our go-to point person for marketing in europe.",
        "Rick: What do you think?",
        "Ridge: I don't know, this is all very unexpected. I mean, this is your sister. It's lizzy's aunt.",
        "Maya: She's more than that. Nicole means the world to me. But I really think that this could be a positive change for everyone.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, you know, paris would be a great opportunity. Why don't I see what zende and nicole have to say about it?",
        "Steffy: Goodbye? What do you -- what do you mean?",
        "Sally: I'm leaving town. Shouldn't really be too much of a surprise.",
        "Steffy: Wait. Where are you gonna go?",
        "Sally: I actually have no idea where I'm gonna end up, but there's nothing left for me here in los angeles. Thomas is in new york, you know, with caroline and his son, and spectra was all but burned to the ground. A terrible accident... so it's time for me to figure out what to do with the rest of my life. Anyway, um... I just wanted to apologize and say that I'm sorry for all of the trouble that I caused you.",
        "Liam: I'm not blackmailing you.",
        "Bill: It's hard hearing the word out loud, isn't it? A little too unsavory for you? Are you wrestling with your ethics? You want to sanitize it? Okay, what would you like to call it?",
        "Liam: I don't think you understand the gravity of this. I could call lieutenant baker right now, and you would be arrested on the spot.",
        "Bill: You have really thought about this, probably even dreamed about it -- when you could unseat me, stage your little coup. You feel like you've been ignored around here? Like you haven't been heard enough? You wanted more philanthropy, i gave it to you. The fashion showdown raised over $1 million for the spencer foundation. So you go ahead. Threaten me all you want. They can't trace that fire back to me anyway. And I only told you because you needed to hear it. I told you because you're my son and I love you. And I trusted you. Was that a mistake? What more do you want from me, liam? You want more transparency? Is that it? Okay. I'll give it to you. I told justin to get someone to set fire to spectra fashions so I could build spencer tower. That's it! Okay? Are you satisfied? Are you happy now? Can we move on? I did it!",
        "Liam: Sure. Let's move on.",
        "Bill: What are you doing?",
        "Liam: I'm just e-mailing something to myself for safe keeping.",
        "Bill: You want more transparency? Is that it? Okay. I'll give it to you. I told justin to get someone to set fire to spectra fashions so I could build spencer tower. That's it! Are you satisfied? Are you happy now?",
        "Liam: No evidence, huh? Gotcha.",
        "Ridge: And what sally did, stealing our designs, it destroyed a complete collection and it set us back and we were shorthanded, and... I asked you to step up, and you did, beautifully.",
        "Zende: I was happy to. Thank you for the opportunity.",
        "Ridge: I talked to you a little bit in that meeting we had earlier about your designs and how great they are. And how they're new, but they're still distinctly forrester. And your miles ahead of anyone else your age, and... I just need you to be careful. You got to think about what's next. You can't stop learning. You always have to keep an open mind. Now, there's an opportunity that's come up, and I think it might be kind of good for you.",
        "Zende: Okay. What is it?",
        "Ridge: How would you and nicole like to move to paris, work at international?",
        "Sally: So, I know I've been nothing but a pain, and there's no way that I can make it up to you, but I would like to give you a little parting gift. Some of my sketches. Ones that weren't burned in the fire. I want you to have them. These were supposed to be a new era for spectra, but obviously they're of no use to me anymore. [ Sighs ] You can do whatever you want with them, you know? But I would like you to take them as a peace offering.",
        "Steffy: Sally, I couldn'T.",
        "Sally: No, I -- I want you to have them, steffy. It's only fitting. I stole all of your designs, and now... I want you to have the last of mine.",
        "Steffy: I honestly don't know what to say.",
        "Sally: You don't have to say anything, steffy. Really, I have been nothing but a royal pain in the butt. Seriously, in some other world, some lifetime, I think that maybe we could have actually been friends.",
        "Bill: You recorded our private conversation?",
        "Liam: You went too far, dad. This definition you have of a spencer man, the way that you do business, it's not business. It's criminal activity, and it stops now.",
        "Bill: You're gonna tell me... you're going to tell me... you have absolutely lost your mind if you think for one second that I'm going to let you get away with this.",
        "Liam: A young woman comes to L.A. With a dream of making it. She's got talent, she's got vision...",
        "Bill: Oh, for god's sake.",
        "Liam: ...She's got the drive to become a fashion designer, and you -- you take all of that away from her, and you think that's what being a man looks like?",
        "Bill: What is it with you? Does it make you feel strong, defending sally spectra? Oh, wait a minute. [ Laughs ] I see it. You have a thing for her!",
        "Liam: Okay. All right. You know something? I thought that somewhere deep down in there, there would be some compassion. There's not even a speck of it, is there? You don't even know what that looks like, do you? And it's evident in your business practices. The low wages, the meager health benefits, the fear and intimidation practices. You have put this company and our family -- our family, you, me, wyatt, will -- in jeopardy. Unh-unh. You will step down, and you will take not only a leave of absence but a long, hard look at yourself, as long as it takes. Until then, I'm C.E.O.",
        "Bill: The hell you are.",
        "Liam: You're gonna have a memo on my desk tomorrow morning announcing that you are stepping down effective immediately.",
        "Bill: On your desk?",
        "Liam: Yeah, my desk, because this is my office now. I will protect the spencer name! I will preserve whatever dignity this company has left! It's time for new leadership, and that's me.",
        "Bill: Boy... you have lost your mind.",
        "Liam: 9:00 A.M. Tomorrow morning. Not 9:01. 9:00. Or I call the police. You get me? Tomorrow, I become the new C.E.O. Of spencer publications. . ."
