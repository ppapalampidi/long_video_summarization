        "On the steps of the Sydney Opera House, Steffy and Ivy put on a fashion show photo shoot that wows the crowd. Liam thanks Bill for being there and helping him get ready for the wedding. He knows Brooke is getting married too today and his mind must also be on that. Bill says yes but this day is going the way Liam wants it, nothing will go wrong. Quinn tells Eric this is a very important day and she wants to look her best. He says she will. Shirley talks to Sally on the phone and says this is not a prom date, so get those pictures with Thomas and get them on video out there. Thomas, not knowing this, tells Sally that she will attend the wedding but no pictures or videos and he hopes she can handle that. She is trustworthy, right? Darlita tells Saul that Sally is not using Thomas. She actually likes him. She just needs to get those pictures. Brooke tells Katie they are having fun so no more talk about Ridge and Quinn.",
        "Quinn tells Eric that to never doubt that she loves him and she is looking forward to this Forrester wedding. Liam cannot get any of the details out of the minister as Steffy has kept that from him too. He calls Steffy but no last minute details from her either, just that she loves him. He tells her to hurry up and get there. Even Ivy who has arrived at the site will not tell him more. All are anxiously awaiting. Ridge says she will always be Daddy's little girl and he just wants Liam to love her the way she loves him and they will be okay. Liam is unhappy to see Sally there as Steffy will not like it but he makes Thomas promise that Sally will behave. Finally the moment arrives and out of the clouds floats Steffy down on a swing and alights in a gorgeous wedding pants gown. Sally turns her back and takes a quick photo."

        "[Cheers and applause]",
        "Bill: Have you talked to the minister?",
        "Liam: Yesterday.",
        "Bill: License, rings all covered?",
        "Liam: Got it all covered.",
        "Bill: Attaboy.",
        "Liam: Hey.",
        "Bill: Huh?",
        "Liam: Thank you.",
        "Bill: For what?",
        "Liam: Just being here.",
        "Bill: You don't have to thank me. Where else would I be? It's your wedding day.",
        "Liam: I know, I know, but there is somebody else who's getting married today, and I know that's a tough one for you. Um, have you talked to Brooke?",
        "Bill: Today is not about Brooke and me. It's about you. My son and his bride.",
        "Brooke: I can't believe that your daughter is doing a photo shoot on her wedding day.",
        "Ridge: I can. Thank you.",
        "Brooke: Well, you know, they've been through so many challenges just to get to this place. You would think that she'd be in total bride mode.",
        "Ridge: She is in bride mode. That's what she does. Marathon or photo shoot. Whatever it is, she gets it done. I just want this to be a special day for her. No drama.",
        "Sally: It is so beautiful, grams. You see pictures of this place, but to actually be here... wow.",
        "Shirley: You're getting yourself ready for Steffy's wedding?",
        "Sally: Yeah, Thomas insisted that I use his suite to get ready while he's at the photo shoot. He's actually quite the gentleman whenever he wants to be.",
        "Shirley: He's a Forrester, sally. Just remember why you're there.",
        "Sally: I am here to go to the wedding as Thomas' date.",
        "Shirley: [Sighs] Yes, but you need to take some pictures. Something we can take to the bank, create a little buzz. Honey, we are dying on the vine here. The future of spectra's in your hands. You need to come through.",
        "Quinn: Where are my earrings?",
        "Eric: Uh, what are you looking for? You're looking for the silver ones, right?",
        "Quinn: No.",
        "Eric: Not the gold ones.",
        "Quinn: No, the ones that I've been working on all week.",
        "Eric: Well, you better find them or the world's gonna collapse around your feet.",
        "Quinn: I made them specifically for today. It's not funny.",
        "Eric: It is funny.",
        "Quinn: No!",
        "Eric: You're funny. You're hilarious.",

        "Bill: In a minute! Looking good.",
        "Liam: Okay. Thanks. Yeah.",
        "Bill: Okay, look. You got to relax, all right? This is your wedding day, not a job interview.",
        "Liam: I know. I know that. It's just... we've been this close before.",
        "Bill: And it's going to happen this time. Nothing is gonna go wrong.",
        "Liam: Right. I wish I knew more about whatever she's got planned for me, though. She sure is keeping me in suspense.",
        "Bill: That's why you married her, isn't it? She keeps you on your toes.",
        "Liam: Yeah.",
        "Bill: Can't have too much of that.",
        "Liam: Yeah. I can't. It's one of the many reasons. You're right. You are right!",
        "Bill: Well, of course I'm right. You know your dad's always right.",
        "Liam: [Laughs]",
        "Bill: It's gonna be an exciting day. One you'll never forget.",
        "Shirley: Are you hearing me, sally? You are on a mission, not a prom date!",
        "Sally: I am here as Thomas' guest.",
        "Shirley: Yes. You are at Steffy Forrester's private wedding. You need to get the exclusive. Get those pictures out there. Once you put them on the internet, they will go viral.",
        "Sally: I got to go, grams.",
        "Shirley: The future of spectra is in your hands. Make us proud. Get those pictures! Steffy, how are we supposed to keep up with you?",
        "Steffy: Oh, run fast and very, very hard. Work in the morning and marry in the afternoon?",
        "Steffy: Yeah, that's just how we roll, I guess. Will the press be invited to the wedding?",
        "Steffy: Uh...",
        "Ivy: No. No photos, no videos, no press. It's strictly family. Private event.",
        "Thomas: Thank you all so much for coming. I appreciate it. But my beautiful sister has a wedding to get ready for.",
        "Steffy: Yes. Steffy, before you go, how about you don't marry Liam? You stay here and you marry me.",
        "Steffy: Oh! We can make a life together. I'm a great cook.",
        "Steffy: Okay! You know what? Tell Liam the wedding is off!",
        "Ivy: Oh! Not on your life! Thank you all so much for coming.",
        "[Cheering]",
        "Steffy: And what about Thomas?",
        "Ivy: Oh, your brother has no idea what we have planned.",
        "Steffy: Honestly, I could have never pulled this off without you, ivy. Seriously.",
        "Ivy: That's so sweet. I've had so much fun doing this with you.",
        "Steffy: Really?",
        "Ivy: Yeah, I really hope that today is everything you ever dreamed it would be. And I know that that sounds kind of weird coming from me because of my history with Liam, but I'm his past. You're his future. I just hope you do know that I really am good with that.",
        "Steffy: Cheers, ivy.",
        "Saul: I can't believe you're encouraging her to crash another Forrester wedding.",
        "Shirley: She isn't crashing, Saul. She's an invited guest. Sort of. Regardless, today's the day.",
        "Darlita: I thought you said it was tomorrow.",
        "Shirley: No, it's today. But because of the time difference, today is tomorrow there.",
        "Saul: Just count back five hours but then add a day. She is groveling at Thomas Forrester's feet. Sally is too good for that.",
        "Shirley: She is there for one reason -- publicity, juice, buzz, pr that we so desperately need. A private Forrester wedding. And our sally there documenting her presence. [Gasps] We'll be the only other fashion house that's got an invitation. Spectra.",
        "Saul: Thomas knows she's gonna do this?",
        "Thomas: Hey.",
        "Sally: Hey. How was the photo shoot?",
        "Thomas: Great. Tons of fans. There is no denying that my sister is a star.",
        "Sally: Uh, do you want me to go in the other room?",
        "Thomas: I'm sorry, does this offend you?",
        "Sally: No. No. Not at all.",
        "Thomas: All right, good. How's the flight recovery coming?",
        "Sally: Pretty -- pretty good.",
        "Thomas: Mm-hmm. By the way, it's really cool of you -- jetting out here on your own like that.",
        "Sally: Yeah, well, I'm sure your sister won't think so whenever I show up as your date.",
        "Thomas: That is her problem. One thing, though. Uh, it's a private wedding. No photos, no videos. Think you can you handle that?",
        "[Knocks on door]",
        "Steffy: Dad. Hi.",
        "Ridge: Hey. Uh, you alone?",
        "Steffy: Ivy just left for the ceremony.",

        "Steffy: A minute alone with your daughter.",
        "Ridge: Yeah.",
        "Steffy: It's okay, dad. We're gonna -- we're gonna get through this.",
        "Ridge: Yeah. This is -- this is easy. Nothing.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, totally. You know, I'd be really disappointed if there were no tears.",
        "Ridge: Well, there are not gonna be any tears. I was -- last night, I was looking at a picture of you, and you were just a kid, and you were...",
        "Steffy: Dad. Don't --",
        "Ridge: And you were smiling at me, and I just wanted to make sure that you had enough smiles left for your husband.",
        "Steffy: He'll have his fair share.",

        "Steffy: [Laughs] Me, too.",

        "Saul: I don't like sally stooping to this level.",
        "Shirley: Saul, we need her to do this.",
        "Saul: I'm not talking about that.",
        "Darlita: Don't worry, Saul. She's not just using Thomas. She actually likes him.",
        "Shirley: Darlita, you are not helping.",
        "Darlita: I'm not?",
        "Shirley: It's all right, sweetie. Sally's just there to get the publicity that we so desperately need. And when she does, we're gonna be off and running. Just think of all the traffic we're gonna have. [Sighs] Sally just has to get those pictures.",
        "Thomas: It's the same thing with all celebrity weddings. You just can't take any photos. No videos. Sometimes they even make you check the phone at the door.",
        "Sally: Do you think they'll do that here?",
        "Thomas: No, we trust all the guests. You are trustworthy, right?",
        "Sally: Well, my mom always said I was.",
        "Thomas: We just don't want any pictures getting leaked online. Steffy would go ballistic if that happened.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] Okay. Okay. Here. Let me fix that.",
        "Katie: Can you do that? Thank you. Thank you.",
        "Brooke: There. That's perfect. Aww, you're beautiful!",

        "Brooke: Come on! Let's go get that girl married.",
        "Katie: Let's marry her off.",
        "Brooke: Oh! We're having fun, right?",
        "Katie: Yeah.",
        "Brooke: Okay, so, no more talk about ridge and Quinn.",
        "Eric: Well, you're all ready to head out, aren't you?",
        "Quinn: Another fabulous Forrester wedding.",
        "Eric: Mm-hmm. You'll get used to it after a while. We have a lot of weddings in this family.",
        "Quinn: Nope, I am never going to get used to it. Most people dream at night. My dreams begin when I wake up in the morning and I look at you. I love you, Eric Forrester. Don't ever doubt that.",

        "Liam: Yeah, it was. Listen, um... when it comes to details, uh, Steffy's been a little secretive with me. I don't suppose she's told you more than she's told me.",
        "Reverend Harris: She's a mysterious bride.",
        "Liam: Agh! Yep. That'd be my Steffy. The only thing I actually know for sure is that I'm getting married today, and here, I think, which is nice because I can't think of a better place on god's earth.",
