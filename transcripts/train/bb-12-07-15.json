    "Recap": [
        "Steffy stands terrified that Ivy is in the electrical wires and is frying. She grabs her phone and calls for an ambulance, someone has been electrocuted. Steffy tries to give CPR with the help of the person on the phone until help arrives. Eric shows up and comforts Steffy while the paramedics work on Ivy. Liam shows up at Wyatt's door. Liam asks about Ivy. Liam tells him to give himself a minute to grasp this about Thomas and Ivy, it was just a moment. That is his brotherly advice. Wyatt says he gave his all to Ivy that Thomas was just wasting his time but she got swept up in it anyway. He does not think he can trust her again. Eric tells Quinn she has outdone herself; her designs are exquisite. Thomas speaks up and says it was Ivy. Pam interrupts by telling them there has been an accident involving Ivy. Steffy screams for Ivy to breathe; finally she has a breath. Liam hands Wyatt a drink and says he is sorry this happened. Liam says he told Steffy to stay out of this. Wyatt says it was not her fault. He would still be in the dark if Steffy had not told him. She got no pleasure out of this. Liam says Ivy will blame Steffy for this so maybe Wyatt should call and keep the line of communication open.",
        "Quinn calls and tells Wyatt that Ivy has been in an accident. He says he is on his way. At the hospital Thomas comforts Steffy and asks for details. She does not want to talk about it. Finally she says it was an accident when Ivy tripped when Steffy pushed her away from attacking her. Thomas is afraid of how this will look. Wyatt and Liam show up and need to know what happened. The doctor comes out and says they are taking tests and they will know then. They need to find what might have happened to the heart or the brain and muscles. Her skin is the actual last place to worry about now. Still she is in critical condition. They all want to see her. Eric says he has always taken great pride and no accidents like this has ever happened at FC. He's trying to get in touch with John and his wife but no luck yet. The doctor tells them he is breaking the rules letting them all in so they must let her rest. Wyatt goes to her and speaks over her that he hopes she can hear him. He takes her hands and holds it and strokes her hair. He says he does not care what happened earlier, only that she gets through this. Liam questions Steffy. Ivy was not there when they were together yet Steffy was with Ivy when this happened. This is what he was afraid of. She should have waited for Ivy to tell Wyatt. He says he knows she would not hurt a fly but he needs her to look him in the eye and tell him that this was a freak accident and had nothing to do with her."

        "Steffy: No! No! This is not funny!",
        "Ivy: [Gasps]",
        "[Electricity zapping]",
        "Steffy: [Breathing heavily] We need -- we need an ambulance. There's been an electrocution. We're -- we're at Forrester creations. Yes, Forrester Creations. [Sobs]",

        "Wyatt: You know.",
        "Liam: Where's Ivy?",
        "Wyatt: If that's your way of asking me if it's over between us, you got to work that out, man.",
        "Liam: Listen to me. I know this is nothing like what you expected, but you just... you got to give yourself a minute, 'cause you and Ivy --",
        "Wyatt: Had everything going for us. Then the company playboy swooped in and convinced her otherwise. But, I mean, what does Thomas care, right? Because every relationship is fair game. The more committed, the more together they are, the greater the challenge. I mean, he -- he is his father's son. But even Ridge wouldn't have done what Thomas did.",
        "Thomas: California Freedom's got all the momentum, granddad, all right? Competitors are already sweating the next preview.",
        "Eric: Yeah, they should. These latest designs are stunning.",
        "Carter: I think the man's impressed.",
        "Quinn: I think we all are. But, like they say, accessories make the outfit.",
        "Eric: They do, don't they?",
        "Quinn: They do. [Chuckles]",
        "Eric: Look at this. This is great. You've outdone yourself again, Quinn. This is gorgeous.",
        "Thomas: Don't -- don't you mean, uh, Ivy has? I mean, you drew the original sketches, but, uh, Ivy came up with the concept, right?",
        "Eric: I think maybe Wyatt deserves some of the credit. I mean, he does wonderful work. But ivy's been particularly inspired since they're an item.",

        "[Cell phone chimes]",
        "Thomas: Well, guess that means the meeting's over, then, huh?",
        "Eric: No, you stay right where you are, young man. This will just take a moment.",
        "Quinn: So, have you given any more thought to my earlier proposition?",
        "Thomas: So that's what you were doing -- propositioning me?",
        "Quinn: [Laughs] No, see? I'm a happily married woman.",
        "Thomas: I know what you were referring to. You want Wyatt to end up with Steffy instead of Ivy.",
        "Quinn: Well, there's no need to be so Machiavellian about it. Just want my son to be happy.",
        "Eric: All right, let's finish this up before there's another interruption.",
        "Pam: Uh, security just called. There's been an accident downstairs. Paramedics are here. It's Ivy.",
        "Liam: I'll say it again, man. You just -- you have to give it time. Ivy loves you, Wyatt.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah? Well, that doesn't change the fact of what happened.",
        "Liam: Yeah, maybe not. But we all make mistakes. [Scoffs] I sure have, you have.",
        "Wyatt: Is that your brotherly advice right now?! \"Forgive and forget\"?!",
        "Liam: Hey, you know she didn't want to hurt you, right? You know that.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, so it was Thomas! It was only Thomas! That's how this works!",
        "Liam: I don't know, bro. You -- you said yourself the guy is relentless.",
        "Wyatt: But I put all my trust into Ivy not to give in to him. I was so sure of it that I went on and on and on to Thomas, to mom, to Steffy, to you, everyone, that she wasn't interested. He was just wasting his time. And she got swept up in it anyway. And right now... I don't know. I don't think I could ever trust her again.",
        "Steffy: 27, 28, 29. [Sighs] [Gasping] She's still not breathing! Continue the chest compressions. Help is on the way. Just remain calm.",
        "Steffy: ...3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. [Clatter] They're here! They're here!",
        "[Radio chatter] What happened?",
        "Steffy: There were sparks. There were sparks. There were sparks. Miss? Miss? You okay? Miss?",
        "Steffy: And she was electrocuted.",
        "Thomas: Steffy, is she -- We'll take it from here.",
        "Steffy: She -- she -- she wasn't breathing. That woman told me to give her compressions, but I couldn't -- I couldn't feel a pulse.",
        "Eric: Okay, Steffy, it's okay. It's okay.",
        "Steffy: You need to help her!",
        "Eric: They're here now.",
        "Steffy: You need to help her!",
        "Eric: It's okay. It's okay. They're gonna help her.",
        "Steffy: She needs to live. She needs to live. She needs to live. Ready to go.",

        "[Flat line]",
        "Steffy: This is insane! Nothing's working! They shocked her twice!",
        "Eric: All right, all right. Shh, shh. Charging! 360! Clear! Clear.",
        "Steffy: [Gasps] Breathe, Ivy! Breathe! Hold compressions.",
        "[Monitor beeps] We have a pulse.",
        "Steffy: [Gasps] Oh, my God. Thank God, thank God.",
        "Eric: Good, good, good.",

        "Thomas: I'll drive you.",
        "Steffy: Okay. ETA -- university's 15 minutes out. Copy that.",
        "Liam: I'm sorry this happened.",
        "Wyatt: Wasn't your fault.",
        "Liam: Well, in a way, maybe it is. I told Steffy to stay out of it, to let Ivy come to you. If I had maybe taken a harder line with her...",
        "Wyatt: Okay. No one can tell Steffy Forrester to stay out of something, especially if she thinks she's doing something for the right reasons.",
        "Liam: Do you think she was?",
        "Wyatt: Liam, if Steffy hadn't have told me, I might still be left in the dark about all this.",
        "Liam: Yeah. And then again, if she kept her mouth shut, Ivy would have had a chance to tell --",
        "Wyatt: It's not like Steffy had pleasure in telling me! If I hadn't have pushed her... anyway, your fianc\u00e9e was just looking out for me, and I'm grateful, okay? Let's just leave it at that.",
        "Liam: I don't know if ivy's gonna see it that way.",
        "Wyatt: [Sighs]",
        "Liam: I mean, she'll -- she'll blame Steffy for interfering in her relationship, or worse. Maybe you should call, check up on Ivy. Just -- right now, of all times, you should keep the line of communication wide open, you know?",
        "Wyatt: I mean, how could things change that quickly?",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Wyatt: [Sighs] Hardly the time, Mom.",
        "Quinn: Wyatt, something has happened, something terrible.",
        "Wyatt: What?",
        "Quinn: Ivy's been in an accident.",
        "Wyatt: What?",
        "Quinn: The paramedics took her to the hospital. Honey, it's serious.",
        "Wyatt: Um, I'm on my way, okay?",
        "Liam: What is it?",
        "Wyatt: It's Ivy.",
        "Liam: What?",
        "[Radio chatter] Just head on in. Please wait out here. We'll know more once I've examined her.",
        "Steffy: She -- she -- she shouldn't be alone.",
        "Thomas: Steff, we got to let them do their job, okay? The doctor's gonna -- look, I'm -- I'm worried about you, too.",
        "Steffy: I just want to be with them.",
        "Thomas: I know, I know, I know. Hey, hey. What's going on? I know there was an electrical panel involved. What's going on?",
        "Steffy: No, I-I don't -- Thomas, I don't want to -- I don't want to talk about this right now. I don't want to talk about this!",
        "Thomas: Why were you two backstage? What aren't you telling me?",
        "Steffy: [Gasps]",
        "Thomas: Steff. It's a simple question, isn't it?",
        "Steffy: Why are you accusing me?",
        "Thomas: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Why would you say that?",
        "Steffy: Because that's what it sounds like.",
        "Thomas: No. Well, I'm not, okay? Look, you're upset. It's okay. It's okay.",
        "Steffy: There -- I don't know. She went backstage. There was a -- there was an electrical panel, and she --",
        "Thomas: Okay. Hey, hey, hey. It's okay. It's okay. We don't have to talk about this right now. It's okay. It's fine.",
        "Steffy: She shouldn't have been backstage.",
        "Thomas: Wait, wait. What?",
        "Steffy: When she -- when she tripped, she... when she tripped...",
        "Thomas: So that's what happened?",
        "Steffy: [Sniffles] It was an accident.",
        "Thomas: She was backstage, and she tripped?",
        "Steffy: It was an accident. She tripped when I... she tripped when I p-pushed her away.",
        "Eric: I know it's bad reception. I can tell. I need to speak to my brother. It's an emergency.",
        "Carter: Eric.",
        "Eric: Yeah. Wait. Wait.",
        "Carter: Had the whole backstage area blocked off. I just spoke to Jake. Luckily the electrician switched off the breaker seconds after Ivy came in contact with the electric panel.",
        "Quinn: I still don't understand how something like this could happen. I mean, Ivy is a bright girl. If sparks were flying like Steffy said, why would she get anywhere near that?",
        "Thomas: Wait. You pushed Ivy?",
        "Steffy: She grabbed my arm, and then I -- then I pushed her away.",
        "Thomas: [Sighs] W-w-were you two arguing?",
        "Steffy: I was waiting for an all-clear backstage at the panel, and then Ivy came up to me and -- and she accused me. She said I deliberately tried to break up her and Wyatt.",
        "Thomas: They broke up?",
        "Steffy: She got in my face, and then I -- I just... I pushed her, and then she fell into the panel, and she got... she... she got electrocuted.",
        "Liam: Hey! Hey, hey!",
        "Steffy: Hi!",
        "Liam: How's Ivy? Where is she?",
        "Steffy: [Sobs]",
        "Thomas: She's -- she's in there. We don't really know what's going on. The doctor's with her right now.",
        "Wyatt: What happened?",
        "Thomas: She was electrocuted.",
        "Liam: What?!",
        "Wyatt: How?",
        "Steffy: She fell into the panel, and she got electrocuted. It was horrible.",
        "Wyatt: Please tell me she's okay. Is this the doctor?",
        "Steffy: Yeah.",
        "Wyatt: Is this him?",
        "Steffy: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. How is she?",
        "Wyatt: Is -- is -- is she conscious, in pain, what?",
        "Doctor: I assume you're the patient's family, too?",
        "Wyatt: Uh...",
        "Thomas: What -- what can you tell us?",
        "Doctor: We're doing a number of tests. Once the results are back, I'll be better able to answer your questions. Though you should know there can be any number of complications from electric shock.",
        "Wyatt: Like what?",
        "Doctor: Our primary concern right now is determining if any significant unseen damage exists. Injury may have occurred to the muscles, the heart, and/or brain. Much depends on the amount of current that passed through Ivy's body, as well as the duration.",
        "Steffy: The circuit shut off within seconds.",
        "Doctor: Which is undoubtedly why Ivy is alive right now and why the percentage of her body surface that was burned is relatively small. Still, the healthy skin often conceals injured nerves, tissue, and bones. And plus infection is an added concern. I'm sorry. I realize this may be hard to hear, but Ivy's in critical condition.",
        "Wyatt: Um... I want to see her.",
        "Steffy: We all do.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "[Monitor beeping]",
        "Pam: Still no luck?",
        "Eric: They're sending a messenger out for John now.",
        "Quinn: What about her mother?",
        "Eric: We haven't been able to get in touch with her, either.",
        "Pam: Well, maybe by the time you do, we'll have good news.",
        "Eric: Yeah, maybe. This is a safe working environment. We've never had an accident like this before. I've always taken great pride in that.",
        "Pam: Carter's been talking to Jake.",
        "Eric: Yeah, well, I want to talk to him, too, as soon as we find out if...ivy's okay. God. I remember when John told me that they were pregnant again. They had been trying for so long, and that -- that just... they'd given up. And then along comes Ivy. He called her his little miracle. And he still calls her that. What am I gonna say to him?",
        "Pam: What you are gonna say to him is that we are all praying for her and the power of prayer still works miracles. And it's going to this time, too. That's what you're gonna say to him.",
        "[Monitor beeping] I'm bending the rules allowing you all to be in here. You need to make this brief.",
        "Wyatt: Is she, uh, still unconscious or...? Yes. Although studies report patients saying they heard and understood various conversations while unconscious.",
        "[Door opens, closes]",
        "Wyatt: Hi, babe. It's me, Wyatt. Um... the doctor said that you may be able to hear me, and -- and I hope you can. Look, I... I don't care what happened earlier between us, okay? All that matters is that you make it through this. You are gonna make it, okay? [Sniffles]",
        "[Door opens]",
        "[Door closes] The rest will be ready soon, Doctor.",
        "Steffy: Do you have my cousin's results? I know you're looking for hopeful news.",
        "[Pager beeps] And I wish I could give it to you. Excuse me.",
        "Steffy: I-I -- [Gasps] Oh. [Sniffles]",
        "Liam: I don't even understand. How does something like this even happen?",
        "Steffy: [Sniffles] [Sighs]",
        "Liam: You were with her, right?",
        "Steffy: Yeah.",
        "Liam: Well, Ivy wasn't there when we were backstage.",
        "Steffy: You -- you already left. I was waiting for Jake and the electrician, and then Ivy showed up, and she was upset about Wyatt and -- and she confronted me.",
        "Liam: Great. Are you surprised? This is exactly what I was afraid of, Steffy. I mean, if you just -- if you just didn't meddle in their relationship!",
        "Steffy: I tried not to! I was --",
        "Liam: Then you should have avoided Wyatt.",
        "Steffy: I-I would try to avoid him! I tried!",
        "Liam: Tell me you had nothing to do with this, that -- that -- that it was a freak accident, and you weren't involved in any way. Because I know you. I know you, Steffy. You wouldn't hurt a fly. But what I need from you right now is to look me in the eyes and say that the reason Ivy is in that hospital bed has nothing, literally zero, to do with you."
