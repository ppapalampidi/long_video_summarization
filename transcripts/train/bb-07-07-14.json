        "Liam is quivering on the floor with Quinn holding the sword to his neck. She rants that she told him over and over but he would not listen. He begs her not to do this as everyone will know and she will lose Wyatt. She says he is just a random bag of blood that no one will miss. Wyatt and Hope are not weaklings like him and they will get on with their lives. He breaks away temporarily but she grabs him and he lands on the floor prone again with her bending over him with the sword this time right at his chest. She draws it back with both hands and is about to plunge it just as Wyatt barges in and calls her name and for her to stop. She tells Wyatt to leave; just meet her back home. He yells again for her to back off and he comes and pulls her off of Liam. He helps Liam to the couch. He tells his mom that she swore to him if this ever happened again that she would come to him first. Her excuse was he doesn't understand what Liam said to her. She says she is the only one who is thinking clearly. Wyatt makes an attempt to get to the telephone to call the police but Quinn knocks it away. He says he came there to keep her from destroying herself; that is what he always does. She says she would have gone away and then he would have the life he wanted. He's outraged that she would think that he would step over his dead brother's corpse and claim his spoils. He doesn't need Hope that badly. Does she think he is that desperate and pathetic. She rages that no, it's Liam who is the pathetic one. Wyatt should have what he has. Wyatt says she is lucky. He could have had her thrown in jail but he asked Liam not to. And he listened. He asks if she is going to kill him too .because after tonight this is going to be the end of the road for one of them. He's the one that has kept her from being put away all these years. He points to Liam and says that is his brother. He's never had a brother. He never had anyone but her to run his behavior by, nobody to challenge that twisted world that she had. Liam is the one who made him want to be a better person; if he wanted something he had to deserve it. And all he wanted was the best for Hope but guess what, it wasn't him. Now he's glad Hope didn't pick him. He would not want her to live in this crazy Quinn world that she created. He tells her to keep her secrets as he already knows too much as it is. The only person she hurt tonight was his and her life. She calms down and even puts her arms around Wyatt and says things will be fine. This isn't the end of the world. It isn't the end of anything. Life is not over. She says Liam is not hurt; he's just angry. And she knows she has been terrible to him but she thinks he understands. She points out that she is a very passionate person; a strong person and sometimes feelings are so powerful they can not control them. Wyatt steels himself and says she should go to prison for this. She's shocked that Wyatt would say such a thing. Liam is angry tonight but he doesn't really care. Tomorrow all the little lost kittens and puppies will be the most important thing. She says she never has to see Liam again; never cross his path if that will be good enough for Wyatt. He says he can not do this anymore. He is done. Stunned, she says she is his mother. She is the one person he can never be done with. She has devoted her life to him and made sacrifices. That should be enough. She grabs the sword but Wyatt takes it away and stabs it into the couch. He tells her it is over. If she can hear anything he says tonight let it be known that life as they knew it as mother and son is over! He's been her keeper for so long that it is making him as crazy as she is and he is done. He does not care who she is. She looks so forlorn, then runs out. Wyatt starts to go after her or call the police or something. But Liam convinces him to just let her go.",
        "Wyatt seems undecided but Liam says again just let her go. Hope comes back downstairs and tells Brooke that she could not sleep. Bill quips all it will take is one finger of scotch and that will do the trick. Hope says she needs to tell them that Quinn Fuller has gone off the deep end. Again Bill quips the deep end is her permanent address. Hope tells them that Liam thinks Quinn may have keys to his place since she always manages to get in. His sprained ankle was because he was trying to get away from her. She wants Liam to leave and go to Paris and she wants her job back at FC and in the process she said she wanted to kill him ..and Hope too. Bill says that's it; he is going to go talk to Quinn himself. Brooke tells him absolutely not. She doesn't want him anywhere near that woman. She offers that maybe Liam can come spend the night in their house. Hope says he knows there is no way that Liam will let Quinn run him out of his own home. When Bill hears that Wyatt knows all of this and is probably speaking to her at the moment, he wants to talk about something much more pleasant \u0096 their wedding. Hope throws him a look and it's clear she wants no part of this. But when Bill leaves to go upstairs, she tells her mother that she only wants her to be happy and if it is Bill, okay she will try to coexist with him. Brooke only wishes that Hope could be happy for her. She understands Wyatt's dilemma too. His mother is fundamentally broken and he is protective of her. Hope says she agrees that Wyatt is better off without her but it's hard to turn your back on your own mother. She says she will try extra hard to be nice to Bill as she knows it makes her mother happy. Plus he's going to be her father-in-law so she doesn't have a choice. Liam asks Wyatt where does he think his mother will go. Wyatt says she doesn't know how to hide. She thinks everyone else is wrong and she is right so no need to hide. That's why they ended up living in the warehouse. It was a stroke of genius on his part with commercial zoning laws and no neighbors. He's so sorry for all of this. Liam says he gets it now what Wyatt has had to put up with all this time. But he saved his life. Wyatt says he knew this day was coming; he was doomed but he did not want to be alone. Liam says he is not alone, brother, he owes him his life. \"From this day forward there is no such thing as alone.\" He grabs him by the shoulder and gives him a good pat."

        "Quinn: It didn't have to come to this. Didn't I warn you? And warn you and warn you?",
        "Liam: Wait, wait, wait, wait! You'll -- you'll lose everything. Everybody will know it was you. You -- you'll lose Wyatt.",
        "Quinn: No, no, no, no. Because with you gone, at least he's gonna have what he wants. Oh.",
        "Brooke: Oh, honey, I thought you went to bed.",
        "Hope: Yeah, I, uh... I can't sleep.",
        "Bill: Sometimes just one finger of scotch does the trick.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs]",
        "Hope: Guys, uh... Quinn fuller has gone off the deep end.",
        "Bill: The deep end's her permanent address.",
        "Brooke: Did something happen, sweetie?",
        "Hope: Yeah. Um, she was at Liam's last night, and he thinks that she might have keys because she keeps getting inside.",
        "Bill: You know, she does have jewelers tools. Maybe she's picking the locks.",
        "Hope: Um, yeah, well, he's getting them rekeyed tomorrow, and I hope that it's soon enough. You know, the sprained ankle he has is because he was trying to get away from her.",
        "Bill: Wait a minute. What are you talking about?",
        "Brooke: What does she want with Liam?",
        "Hope: [Sighs] Well, she wants him to leave and go to Paris, and she wants her job back at Forrester.",
        "Bill: What does that have to do with Liam?",
        "Hope: She threatened to kill him. And me.",
        "Bill: She did what?",
        "Quinn: You are just a random bag of blood that nobody's going to miss.",
        "Liam: Lis-- listen. Listen. You're not gonna get what you want. I am a bigger obstacle to hope and Wyatt dead than I am alive. They're not even -- they're not even gonna be able to look at each other.",
        "Quinn: Shh, shh, shh!",
        "Liam: They'll blame themselves! Is that what you want?!",
        "Quinn: No, no, no, no. See? They're not weaklings like you. Strong people like us don't waste our time raking through the rubble of who's to blame. Life should be more like death. Nobody cares who you were or what you did, only what you had in the end.",
        "Liam: [Grunts] Aah! Ah!",
        "Wyatt: Mom!",
        "Brooke: I don't think she meant it literally. People say things when they're frustrated.",
        "Bill: And it's no news she has it in for Liam.",
        "Hope: She didn't just lose her temper, though. This woman has lost all grip on what is left of her self-control.",
        "Bill: You know what? I'm gonna go talk to her.",
        "Brooke: No. No! No, I don't want you anywhere near that woman.",
        "Hope: I don't know if it's gonna help anyway. I mean, I tried talking to her and all she does is lie.",
        "Brooke: Oh, hope, I wish you didn't do that.",
        "Hope: Well, sorry. I'm just trying to be honest. I'm trying to tell you what happened.",
        "Brooke: Okay, okay. Maybe Liam should stay here tonight.",
        "Hope: I can tell you right now, he is not going to let Quinn scare him out of his own home.",
        "Brooke: Really? If she had keys to my front door, I don't think I'd be able to sleep here.",
        "Quinn: Wyatt, get out!",
        "Wyatt: You promised me!",
        "Quinn: Baby, go meet me at home!",
        "Wyatt: Back off! I said get away from him now! Get off! You okay?",
        "Liam: Yeah. Y-yeah.",
        "Wyatt: Just hang on to me, all right?",
        "Quinn: You would not be talking to me in that tone of voice if you knew what he said.",
        "Wyatt: You swore to me that if this ever happened again, you would come to me first!",
        "Quinn: I am the one thinking clearly.",
        "Wyatt: Liam, can you walk? We need to get out of here.",
        "Liam: We can't -- you can't leave her. You got to call the police.",
        "Wyatt: All right.",
        "Quinn: No!",
        "Wyatt: What are you doing?! Put that thing down!",
        "Quinn: Why did you even come here?!",
        "Wyatt: To keep you from destroying yourself! Why else would I do the things that I do for you?",
        "Quinn: No, I would've gone away, and then you would've had the life that you wanted.",
        "Wyatt: With my brother dead? What, did you think I'd just step over his bloody corpse and claim the spoils?",
        "Quinn: No, no, no. You never, never be too proud to win!",
        "Wyatt: I don't need hope that badly! What, do you think that no one else could ever love me that much? Is that it? Is that how pathetic and desperate you think that I --",
        "Quinn: No, no, no! He's the pathetic one! Everything he has should be yours!",
        "Wyatt: He has been better to you than you have ever deserved. He could've had you thrown in jail, but I asked him not to. And he's the one that listened. So, what now, huh? Are you gonna kill me, too?",
        "Quinn: What? No. How could you even ask me that?",
        "Wyatt: Because after tonight, this is gonna be the end of the road for one of us.",
        "Bill: Okay, hope. What would you like me to do?",
        "Hope: Go lay down the law to Quinn. You're the one who unleashed her on all of us.",
        "Bill: Oh, really? Is that becoming the official story? Because the truth is, you brought her into our lives.",
        "Brooke: Quinn isn't anybody's fault. She's just a wild card that we have to figure out how to deal with.",
        "Bill: All right, I'm gonna tell you both something. Uh, Quinn's favorite weapon is fear, and she loves to harangue you with all the things she's going to do, but she never does any of them, because then she would lose her power over you. She's crazy, but she's not stupid.",
        "Hope: Yep, that's pretty much what Wyatt said.",
        "Bill: You told Wyatt about all this?",
        "Hope: Yeah. Yeah, he said he'd back her off. He's probably with her right now.",
        "Bill: Okay. Well, there's your solution. As far as I know, Wyatt's the only one she'll listen to anyway. Now let's talk about something much more pleasant, like... our wedding.",
        "Wyatt: Give me that. You made this?",
        "Quinn: It's an exact replica of the -- I know you're angry --",
        "Wyatt: Angry? Why would I be angry? Because of the years of humiliation with living with a maniac who would do or say anything at any given moment? The years of terror that I had just hoping that you wouldn't wake up in the morning and the terror that I had that you would. I just wanted to run away and the guilt that I had for even having that thought, because god knows I'm the one who kept you from being put away. Do you see him? He is my brother, for god sakes. I have never had a brother. I have always been alone with you. I had nobody to run my behavior by, nobody to challenge that twisted world view that you had. He's the one that made me want to be a better person. He is the one who made me realize that if I want things in life, I have to be the person that deserves to get them. And you know what? All I ever wanted was the best for hope. But guess what. It wasn't me. And, no, after tonight, I -- I'm even -- I'm glad that she broke up with me. Because I wouldn't want her living in this -- in this crazy world that you create.",
        "Liam: Ask her what she plans to do to hope.",
        "Quinn: I would've never hurt that girl.",
        "Liam: That is not what you said!",
        "Wyatt: How many other things would you never have done -- have you already done, mom? You know what? No. You keep your secrets to yourself. I know too much about you as is. The only lives that you ruin tonight are yours and mine.",
        "Hope: I think I'm gonna go to bed.",
        "Brooke: Uh, honey...",
        "Hope: No, I just -- I wanted you to know what's going on, and now you do.",
        "Bill: And we appreciate it. And we want you to know what's going on with the wedding and talk about some possible dates so it doesn't conflict with your travel schedule.",
        "Hope: [Sighs] \"We,\" like, \"we think --\" mom, is Bill in charge of informing me of everything that's going on in your life?",
        "Brooke: Honey, he's just trying to be considerate.",
        "Hope: Look, Bill, if I'm not overjoyed every time that I see you, so what? You don't care. Your relationship is with my mom, and you make her happy.",
        "Bill: You know what? I think I'm the one who's going to go upstairs. I'll see you up there.",
        "Brooke: Okay. Sweetie... you have every right to feel the way you do about Bill, but I'm gonna trust that you two are gonna work this out and learn how to coexist.",
        "Hope: I know.",
        "Brooke: But you know what I really wish? I wish you could be happy for me.",
        "Hope: All I want is for you to be happy. That's all I want. And if that's Bill, then... then okay. You know that I love you more than anything, right?",
        "Brooke: Yes.",
        "Hope: I'm sorry. I am, I'm sorry. I just -- I think that my nerves are on edge right now over all this creepiness that's happening with Quinn.",
        "Quinn: You're going to be fine. Everything is going to be fine. This isn't the end of the world. Doesn't have to be the end of anything. Life isn't over. Liam isn't hurt. Are you? See? Of course he's angry. People can't help the way they feel. And I've been terrible to him. He's your brother. But I think he understands. I'm a very passionate person. I'm a strong person. And some -- some feelings are so powerful, we can't control them. Hey. Hey. Sweetheart...",
        "Wyatt: You should go to prison for this.",
        "Quinn: Why would you say such a thing? Is this for his benefit? 'Cause he doesn't care. I mean, he -- he -- he does tonight, but tomorrow, all the little lost kittens and puppy dogs will be the most important thing in the world. I'd never have to see him again. Our paths will never cross. Will that be good enough for you?",
        "Wyatt: I can't do this anymore. I'm done.",
        "Quinn: Done with me being your mother? Is that what you're saying? I'm the one person in the world you can never be done with. Or wasn't devoting my life to you enough? Sacrificing any life of my own -- wasn't that enough for you? Is this it?",
        "Wyatt: Hey!",
        "Quinn: Is this what's gonna satisfy both of you? Is this it?!",
        "Wyatt: Aah! Aah! It's over. Can you hear me for the first time in your life? Life as we know it, as mother and son, is over. You don't have a son! I don't have a mother. And I can't save you. You raised me to believe that I could for so long, but it was just -- it drives me crazy. And being your keeper makes me as crazy as you are. And I'm done. Do you hear me?",
        "Quinn: I'm sorry.",
        "Wyatt: I don't care what you are.",
        "Quinn: Oh.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Wyatt: I got to --",
        "Liam: Wyatt, no.",
        "Wyatt: I got to go after her. We have to call the police. You wanted me to call the police and I --",
        "Liam: Wyatt, Wyatt. Let her go.",
        "Wyatt: I...",
        "Liam: Let her go.",
        "Hope: I'm sorry. I'm sorry about all the times I said I was embarrassed by you, by...who you dated, what you were wearing or weren't wearing.",
        "Brooke: Children are sensitive. Parents, not always. I mean, look at your brother. He would turn beet red every time I picked him up from school. It was horrible.",
        "Hope: Look at Wyatt. You know, look at everything he's had to put up with, and he never complains. He will defend Quinn, no matter what.",
        "Brooke: That's different.",
        "Hope: How?",
        "Brooke: He knows. He knows that she is broken in some fundamental way, and she needs protecting.",
        "Hope: I do think that he's better off without her, but... how do you turn your back on your mother? You know that I would be devastated if anything ever came between us, right? And I promise -- I promise -- I will try really hard to find a way to be nicer to Bill because I know how much it means to you, and... I mean, he's gonna be my father-in-law. What choice do I have?",
        "Brooke: Thank you, honey. And what about Wyatt? He's going to be your brother- in-law.",
        "Hope: Yeah.",
        "Brooke: So is that going to be a problem?",
        "Hope: I guess it just depends on him. I'm really hoping that he and Liam can find a way to get along. [Breathes deeply]",
        "Wyatt: You hurt?",
        "Liam: You know, I think between us, I'm the one who got off easy?",
        "Wyatt: What a night.",
        "Liam: Where... where do you think she'll go?",
        "Wyatt: She doesn't know how to hide. And why should she? She thinks that everyone else is wrong and that she's right. That's how we ended up living in the warehouse. It's a stroke of genius on my part. Zoned commercial so that we'd have no neighbors.",
        "Liam: I... I get it. I get it now, everything you've had to deal with.",
        "Wyatt: I am so sorry for all this.",
        "Liam: Listen... you saved my life.",
        "Wyatt: I know. I mean, maybe -- maybe I always knew this day was coming, you know? I just wanted to be a hero for her. And just... I always knew it was doomed. I just didn't want to be alone.",
        "Liam: You are not alone, brother. I owe you my life. From this point forward, there is no such thing as \"alone.\""
