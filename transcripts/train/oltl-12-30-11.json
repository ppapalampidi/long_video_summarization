        "Everybody is getting read for New Year's. Rex and Gigi have their wedding and everybody happily joins them. But Delfino seems to have a premonition when there's a power outage. She warns John that something terrible will happen that he may not be trained to deal with. Todd motivates Blair to no longer be the victim regarding trusting Tomas. She burns all the bad habits she's had in the past and encourages him to do the same. But at the end of the night right before the count down to the new year, there's a complete blackout. And it appears \"somebody's out there spying upon people who are alone in their homes in the dark."

        "Todd: Uh-oh. What's going on?",
        "Blair: It's T\u00e9a.",
        "Todd: What about T\u00e9a?",
        "Blair: You're never gonna believe the line of bull she tried to sell me.",
        "Starr: Hi. Before we go to U.V., I need to give you a heads up.",
        "James: Oh, about the video going viral? Too late.",
        "Starr: Abuse you I'm yours 24/7 life is solitary have me",
        "John: We still on for tonight? New Year's Eve seems like a good night to have that talk we keep not having.",
        "Natalie: I'm sorry, John. I'm gonna have to postpone again. Something came up.",
        "Viki: Does this room say \"wedding\" to you?",
        "Clint: On a scale of 1 to 10, I'll give it at 14.",
        "Viki: [Laughs]",
        "Clint: It's gonna be a beautiful ceremony.",
        "Viki: Oh, I hope so. I can't think of two people who deserve it more, really.",
        "Rex: Hey, Rox.",
        "Gigi: Roxy! Hi! Aren't you gonna say anything? I'm sure Rex told you the whole story.",
        "Roxanne: Oh, yeah. He told me, all right, but I don't buy a single word of it.",
        "James: 100,000 hits in a day.",
        "Starr: I know. I can't believe it. At least rick kept his part of the deal.",
        "James: The deal?",
        "Starr: Yeah. I had to get the lawsuit dropped, right? In exchange, I let him release the video and manage stuff.",
        "James: What stuff?",
        "Starr: My career.",
        "James: Oh, my God. I cannot believe you are still gonna work with him.",
        "Todd: What did bipolar Delgado say to you?",
        "Blair: It's not what she said to me, Todd. It's what she sent me.",
        "Todd: What's that?",
        "Blair: It's a portrait of me that Tom\u00e1s painted that he never finished.",
        "Todd: Uh, that's not so bad.",
        "Blair: Yeah. Bad -- read bad. The note T\u00e9a sent me.",
        "Todd: \"Thought you might want to hold on to this.\"",
        "Blair: Hold on to it? I mean, the man murdered her husband, betrayed me in the worst possible way -- why would I want to hold on to anything that that man ever touched?",
        "Todd: That's a good question.",
        "Gigi: Ow. Roxy, what are you doing?",
        "Roxanne: I'm looking for scars.",
        "Gigi: I don't have any scars. Stacy is the one who had plastic surgery. I am Gigi. I swear to you.",
        "Rex: Just to be safe, we did a DNA test last night.",
        "Roxanne: So? The DNA lab in this town is worse than the one on \"Fraternity Row.\"",
        "Gigi: Oh, my God. \"Fraternity Row.\" I miss that show. It is gonna take me so long to catch up after all these months.",
        "Roxanne: Well, honey, you don't get to catch up. None of us do.",
        "Gigi: What do you mean?",
        "Roxanne: It's gone the way of the doodoo bird. It got axed.",
        "Gigi: It was canceled?!",
        "Rex: Yeah, it's true. The last episode airs next week.",
        "Gigi: No! Oh, God! That's -- that's terrible.",
        "Roxanne: Okay, you said it was terrible? Because Stacy would never say that it was terrible, so...Gigi! [Laughs] Okay! All right, you got to get your butt in gear. We got to get you married.",
        "Natalie: Gigi and Rex are getting married tonight",
        "John: Hey. No kidding? That's great.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, it is. It's gonna be here at Llanfair.",
        "John: Oh, and you've got to be there.",
        "Natalie: Of course I do. Anyway, I'm sorry for the short notice.",
        "John: No apology necessary. We'll do it another time.",
        "Natalie: Unless you want to be my date to the wedding? And I guess we could talk afterwards.",
        "[Electricity buzzing]",
        "Todd: Something I said?",
        "Viki: Oh, dear. Well, I hope that doesn't happen during the ceremony.",
        "Natalie: Wow. Our lights just flickered. Anything happen by you?",
        "John: I don't know. Some kind of brownout.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, well, I hope it's just temporary, 'cause otherwise we're gonna be having a wedding by candlelight.",
        "John: Well, that sounds kind of romantic.",
        "Natalie: Does that mean that you're gonna make it?",
        "John: I'll be there.",
        "Natalie: Okay. I'll see you soon.",
        "John: See you. Hi.",
        "Delphina: Hi. Hope you weren't making plans for the evening.",
        "John: Why?",
        "Delphina: Because tonight will be a New Year's Eve to remember, but not in a good way.",
        "John: Is this the coming of the apocalypse again?",
        "Delphina: Oh, hilarious. Only I'm not joking.",
        "John: Okay.",
        "Delphina: Didn't you feel a chill when the lights flickered?",
        "John: No. And I'm pretty sure the power company calls it \"brownout.\"",
        "Delphina: It's called \"evil.\" Pure evil. And it's going to rock Llanview to its core.",
        "Todd: Why would T\u00e9a send you something like that?",
        "Blair: I don't know. Maybe it's her hormones. Got a lot going on -- grieving, she's pregnant -- she's got a lot to deal with.",
        "Todd: So?",
        "Blair: So...maybe I'm turning my anger toward the wrong person.",
        "Todd: Who would be the right person?",
        "Blair: That would be Blair Cramer. I mean, come on, Todd. Falling in love with yet another murderer? What is wrong with me?",
        "Todd: Blair, you know... you're not the person that's to blame for everything. Someone else is.",
        "Blair: Who?",
        "James: I don't get how you can work with that creep who blackmailed my brother.",
        "Starr: The key word is \"work,\" James. I'm not going to become best friends with rick. We're going into business together.",
        "James: There isn't any other manager you can work with?",
        "Starr: Not really. Not in Llanview. So he's a little bit of a creep, but --",
        "James: A little bit? Are you kidding me? A little, Starr?",
        "Starr: He believes in my talent, James, and he's willing to work his butt off in order to get my music out there.",
        "James: You're right. He's a prince. The prince of porn.",
        "Starr: James, he's not doing that anymore. He's moved on. And by doing that, he wants to make a dream that I have had ever since I was a little girl come true.",
        "James: Yeah, but is that dream worth all that you're sacrificing to make happen? Think about that, Starr.",
        "Viki: And then the bride will come through these doors and walk over here. Okay. And this will be the aisle. Da-dum-da-da da-dum-da-da",
        "Clint: All that works for me.",
        "Viki: Of course, I'm just a stand-in.",
        "Clint: Who makes a stunningly beautiful bride. And I should know, all the times I've married her.",
        "Viki: You can knock it off, because this is Gigi's day, not mine. Oh, Clint, it's going to be wonderful to see her standing next to the man that she has loved since high school. She's waited an awfully long time for this.",
        "Clint: I'm glad I'm here to be able to see it.",
        "Viki: Mm-hmm.",
        "Clint: You know, all this time, I thought it was Gigi's heart inside of me, improving me... helping to make me a better man. As it turns out, my heart belonged to a stark-raving lunatic.",
        "Viki: Which only goes to show the heart is really just a muscle. It's the goodness that you put into it that counts. And that goodness has always been there. I never forgot that.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Bo: Hey! How'd I get lucky enough to get a preview of the miracle bride?",
        "Roxanne: Bo, don't get mushy with her. We've got to get to hair haven pronto.",
        "Bo: Okay, okay. I'll see you at the ceremony. [Laughs] Balsom, hey!",
        "Rex: Hey, Bo! I'm so glad you could make it to this.",
        "Bo: Oh, listen. This should have happened months and months ago. So, you ready to make up for lost time?",
        "Rex: Definitely.",
        "John: That's it? I mean, it's a little vague, but, um, thank you very much for the warning.",
        "Delphina: I hope you're taking this to heart. This crisis I'm talking about, it's going to affect the entire town.",
        "John: Then I guess it's a good thing we all took that refresher course in crisis management.",
        "Delphina: Except your training may not be able to help you with this.",
        "John: Why is that?",
        "Delphina: Because, lieutenant, you will be in the center of everything. You will be in the eye of the storm.",
        "John: No, I promise I'm gonna keep my eyes open tonight, but to be honest, right now, I got a wedding to get to.",
        "Delphina: What a coincidence. So do I. [Laughs] Excuse me a minute. What? Uh- huh. Look, you told me to warn him, and I warned him. Now, what else can I do? Oh, bup-a-bup-a-bup-a-bup -- the dead are just running off at the mouth tonight.",
        "John: Are these, uh, like, the spirit guides?",
        "Delphina: Oh, yes. Only I'm not sure how much guidance they're giving.",
        "John: Okay, well, maybe you could ask them to tell me how I could stop the darkness before it gets here.",
        "Delphina: Yes, that's the problem, isn't it? There is no way to stop it. The best you can do is be prepared for the worst.",
        "Bo: Oh, Balsom, I tell you, I haven't been this happy about anyone since Matthew opened his eyes.",
        "Rex: I can't wait to see him tonight.",
        "Bo: Yeah, well, listen. About tonight. I don't think he's gonna be able to join us tonight.",
        "Rex: Is he -- he's okay, right?",
        "Bo: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah -- physically, he's just fine. He's, uh, he's just got a few things that he has to work out. That's all. But I know that he is extremely happy for you and Gigi. And so am I.",
        "Clint: Nora. You look beautiful.",
        "Nora: Thank you.",
        "Clint: You didn't forget Bo, did you?",
        "Nora: He's on his way.",
        "Clint: With Matthew?",
        "Nora: Uh, no. Matthew's out of town.",
        "Clint: Out of town where?",
        "Nora: At David and Dorian's. Sounds desperate, doesn't it?",
        "Clint: New Year's Eve with Dorian -- not my first choice.",
        "Nora: Well, probably not his, either, but, oh, Clint, he's had so much to deal with since he came back to us. It's too much. So he ran away.",
        "Roxanne: Hey!",
        "Clint: Sorry.",
        "Roxanne: Hi.",
        "Nora: There she is. Oh, my God!",
        "Roxanne: Oh, no, no, no. Watch the hair.",
        "Nora: You look beautiful for a dead woman.",
        "Gigi: Thank you, darling.",
        "Roxanne: Okay. Enough, enough. She has got a wedding dress to shimmy into, and if we play catch-up, she's gonna be here all week. And you are not to keep my Rexy waiting.",
        "Clint: You know, you got to hand it to Roxy. She's looking out for her boy.",
        "Nora: Yeah. I know the feeling. It's not always easy, though.",
        "Clint: Don't you worry about Matthew. He's got what it takes.",
        "Nora: Why? Because he's a Buchanan?",
        "Clint: I was gonna say \"because he's so much like his mother.\"",
        "Todd: The person that you need to be mad at... is Tom\u00e1s Delgado.",
        "Blair: I made it so easy for him. I trusted him when he gave me every reason not to. I mean, why can't I learn?",
        "Todd: What the hell is the matter with you?",
        "Blair: What?",
        "Todd: What to the woman I fell for? The Blair I know was never a victim. You wouldn't take anything from anybody -- somebody did something wrong to you, you know what you would do?",
        "Blair: Uh, no.",
        "Todd: You'd get mad as hell. You don't remember?",
        "Blair: Well, I remember that getting me in a lot of trouble many times.",
        "Todd: Yeah, but it felt good, right?",
        "Blair: Yeah.",
        "Todd: So quite feeling sorry for yourself. What are you gonna do, huh? Really.",
        "Blair: I'm --",
        "Todd: You're gonna?",
        "Blair: I'm gonna --",
        "Todd: Gonna?",
        "Blair: I'm gonna --",
        "Todd: Gonna? Good for me. Was it good for you?",
        "Starr: Are you saying that my dreams aren't worth anything?",
        "James: No. No. I'm just saying I don't want you trusting the wrong person with that dream.",
        "Starr: I'm not asking you to trust rick, James. I'm asking you to trust me. Do you honestly think that I can't handle this?",
        "James: No, I honestly don't want to fight tonight, okay? Look, Nate and Dani are waiting for us at ultraviolet, so let's just go and try to have a good time.",
        "Starr: Well, I don't think I can.",
        "James: Why? Because of what I said about rick?",
        "Starr: No! Because of hope. She got upset earlier. If the lights go out again, then I need to be here.",
        "James: I thought you said your mom was gonna be here.",
        "Starr: If hope wakes up, she's going to cry for me, not for my mom. I don't want to put my mom through that on New Year's Eve.",
        "James: Is that true or are you just using hope as an excuse?",
        "Starr: I don't use my daughter as an excuse. You know what? If ultraviolet is that important to you, why don't you just go without me?",
        "James: Fine. I will.",
        "Starr: Fine.",
        "James: Fine.",
        "Blair: Is it dead?",
        "Todd: [Chuckling] Yeah. It's toast.",
        "Blair: Hmm.",
        "Todd: You are the winner and still champion.",
        "Blair: Well, if I could only have ripped into Tom\u00e1s, then maybe it would be better, but I guess I'll just have to live with that.",
        "Todd: I think you've found the perfect way to ring in the new year.",
        "Blair: I don't know about that. I don't know. Maybe I'll come up with something better. You have any plans tonight?",
        "John: Hey. Congratulations.",
        "Rex: Thanks, John.",
        "John: You know, seeing things turn out right for you and Gigi kind of makes you believe anything's possible. That, uh --",
        "Rex: Everybody's favorite psychic!",
        "John: So, this was the wedding you were talking about?",
        "Delphina: The very same.",
        "Rex: I asked her to officiate. She's the reason Gigi and I got together in the first place.",
        "Nora: Hey. Isn't it time for the bride to make an appearance?",
        "Rex: Roxy's helping her out.",
        "Nora: Oh, God. When Roxy helped me out, I ended up with green hair. I better go figure this out.",
        "Delphina: Well, I hope she can hurry this along. I'd like to get this wedding over with before all hell breaks loose.",
        "John: Yeah.",
        "Natalie: I have no idea why I am so nervous. I'm not the one getting married.",
        "Viki: Darling, you and John are going to have your talk tonight.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, I know. I just wish I would stop worrying about what he is going to say.",
        "Viki: Oh, honey. You make things so difficult for each other. Hey. Love is in the air tonight. It's gonna rub off on everyone.",
        "Natalie: [Laughs] I hope you're right.",
        "Viki: Oh, honey.",
        "Roxanne: Positions, people! The lady in white is ready to roll.",
        "Delphina: Okay.",
        "[String music plays]",
        "[Laughter]",
        "[String music plays]",
        "Delphina: Tonight Rex and Gigi will be legally united in the bonds of holy matrimony. Please. [Chuckles] These two don't need a ceremony to be bonded for eternity. Their love has already weathered storms that would level most people. [Chuckles] Distance... time... even death -- these things were not enough to pull them apart. Mm-hmm. That is why we are here to celebrate not only the beginning of their journey as husband and wife, but the end of their journey that brought them to this point. And the power of love that guided them. Love is like a flame. If unattended, it withers and dies, almost like it never existed. But when nurtured, love can grow from a spark to a blaze that gets stronger with every passing year. Love can be huddled around for warmth in times of struggle and hardship. It can light the way when darkness is near. With love, nothing is impossible. [Chuckles] Rex and Gigi have taught us that.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Delphina: Now... if there is something that you two would like to say, now would be the time.",
        "Rex: You remember me when we first met. I was kind of lost. I was kind of a jerk. No one ever really made me want to be a better person... until you. I knew you were special, even back then. I also knew that I didn't deserve you. So I took the easy way out. Insanity is sticking here when rich relatives are waiting to meet me in Llanview. Lucky for me, I found a few people who cared about me enough to help me grow up. Thanks to all of them, when you came back into my life, I was ready.",
        "Gigi: Sorry I'm late, Moe. If you had a heart, you'd understand, but you don't, so you won't. Did Noelle clean the aprons like she was supposed to?",
        "Rex: Morasco?! Little did I know I was getting two for one, because you had a surprise for me -- my son. And the two of you have given me the greatest gift of all -- a family to belong to... to love... to fight for. And I will treasure that forever. And I will treasure you forever. I'm going to love, honor, and cherish you until death do us part. And even after that.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Rex: [Sniffles]",
        "Gigi: Well, Balsom... this is kind of like that torch I carried for you all those years. I have been in love with you since the first day we met. Even when I told myself I had to forget you, I just couldn't pull it off. You were in my heart, whether I wanted you there or not. And then one day, you showed up for real. Balsom? I didn't know how to handle it, so I tried to hide how I felt. And then I picked the absolute worst time to tell you.",
        "Shane: Just say it. Tell him.",
        "Gigi: I love you. It's true. I'm in love with you, Rex.",
        "Gigi: All those years, I thought I could go on living without you, but I wasn't living. You brought me back to life, Balsom -- literally.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Gigi: I remember. And did I mention you're a really good kisser?",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Gigi: I will always love you, honor you, and cherish you and our family for the rest of my life and even after that.",
        "Delphina: Now I'd like you two to light that last candle together. There you have it. Two separate forces united as one for eternity. May that candle stay lit well into the new year. Now, if there's anyone here who knows of a reason --",
        "Roxanne: Hey, del. Could you just skip that part? Last time I heard it, things didn't work out so good. [Laughter] So, nobody's got any reason, right?",
        "All: No.",
        "Delphina: All right, then. By the power vested in me by the commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the power of love, I now pronounce you husband and wife. Finally.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "[Applause]",
        "[Electricity buzzes]",
        "Todd: Hi.",
        "Blair: You look, uh...nice.",
        "Todd: And you look like you might be really cold very soon.",
        "Blair: Well, we don't have to be out here all night long, just long enough to do a little ritual burning.",
        "Todd: That's your big plan for New Year's Eve?",
        "Blair: Yeah. I figure we better start the new year fresh. At least, I'm going to. I'm gonna just get rid of all the guilt from last year, and this is how it works. \"Trusting the wrong man.\" Tear that little piece of paper off. Burn it. Whoop! There you go. See? Out of my life, like it never even happened. Care to join me?",
        "Starr: I thought you going to ultraviolet.",
        "James: I did.",
        "Starr: Not fun?",
        "James: Not without you. I'm sorry.",
        "Starr: It's okay.",
        "James: No. Look, I made you feel like I don't care about your dreams, but I do, Starr -- I really do. I guess it's just new for me. You know, not a whole lot of dreams growing up under my dad's roof.",
        "Starr: I know.",
        "James: I don't want to be the guy that holds you back. I want to be the guy sitting in the V.I.P. Section when you're doing the halftime show at the super bowl.",
        "Starr: [Chuckles]",
        "James: And if rick can get you there, then I'm all for it.",
        "Starr: The V.I.P. Section, huh?",
        "James: Hey, I've got dreams, too, you know.",
        "Starr: [Laughs]",
        "James: I love you. And I don't want to start a new year without you.",
        "Blair: This is for all the times that I opened my big mouth. There we go. I can forget all about that. Yep. Hey. What are you writing?",
        "Todd: You keep your eyes on your own note over there.",
        "Blair: No, no, no. That's not how it works, Todd. You have to say it to play it.",
        "Todd: Well, my note, my rules.",
        "Blair: [Laughs]",
        "Todd: You sure this is gonna work?",
        "Blair: Well, why don't you burn it and you'll see. All right. You burn yourself? You have to admit, you feel better, right?",
        "Todd: Yeah. You bet I do.",
        "Rex: Hey. Where are you going?",
        "Shane: I'll be back. I just got to get out of this monkey suit.",
        "Gigi: Well, hang it up -- on a hanger!",
        "Delphina: [Laughs]",
