        "Brooke comes home and hugs Ridge and first thing she wants to know is how he is and is Quinn out of their lives. He tells her about him being named co-CEO. All's well that ends well. All are waiting outside in the hallway and Thomas says he has a feeling he knows what it is all about. Pam tells them to back up; she cannot let them in until Eric says so. CJ tells Sally that she has six months to show a profit or dig her own grave, then it is the wrecking ball. He had an offer and the only reason he is doing this is because she is family. She says Spectra's are not quitters. She will put it all on social media and get the designers and help they need. They need Saul. Shirley says she will go look for some of Sally's old contacts. Sally Jr. says all they need is passion and some imagination. She asks CJ to take a picture at her desk. The group welcomes Eric back to the office and he congratulates Steffy for a good job. Curiously Sally's name comes up with big hair and big personality, the rival fashion house. Sally would stop at nothing to make a knockoff. But Spectra folded years ago and now they are tearing down the building. They haven't had those conflicts in a long, long time. But now he wants to make a few changes. He has talked to Steffy and she has agreed to accept his son and her father, Ridge, as co-CEO. All are shocked with Quinn and Ridge locking eyes.",
        "Rick is the first to speak up and says this is crazy. Eric says no and this is the way it is going to be. Rick says he should have been picked but Eric says no, it was Quinn's suggestion that it be Ridge and he is on board. He tells Nicole, Zende and Maya that they are all important parts of this team and he feels honored to have them and for Brooke too. He cannot wait to see what happens in the future. Ridge hugs his dad. Sally tells CJ that she has idolized her aunt since she was little. That was the reason that she got into fashion. Now she wants to hear all about her from CJ. All he says is music to her ears. A grand dame, a living legend. She will not let her down. Pam asks why is everyone so gloomy; this should be good news. Now Ridge is back where he belongs. Thomas says when is it going to be his turn. Eric tells Quinn that she surprises him every day. She could never let him down. Ridge practically ravages Brooke in his office but Brooke tries to cool him down. He says okay he is now co-CEO so guess he needs to start acting like it. She thinks there is more to it than Quinn just changing and being on his side now. Did something happen while she was away. He says no."

        "Brooke: Mmm! [Exhales sharply]",
        "Ridge: God, I missed you.",
        "Brooke: I missed you, too.",
        "Ridge: How's hope?",
        "Brooke: She's great. She's strong and independent and I couldn't be more proud of her.",
        "Ridge: Well, she's her mother's daughter, after all.",
        "Brooke: So, how's everything here? What's going on between you and Quinn?",
        "Ridge: Me and Quinn? What do you mean?",
        "Brooke: Well, before I left, you said you had a plan to get her out of the office, out of the company. Any success?",
        "Ridge: Yeah, we're -- we're taking steps in the right direction, for sure.",
        "Brooke: Huh. What kind of steps?",
        "Ridge: You're looking at the new co-C.E.O. of Forrester Creations.",
        "Brooke: Get out!",
        "Ridge: Get out!",
        "Brooke: Oh, my God! That's amazing! Oh, my gosh! Congratulations, ridge!",
        "Ridge: Thank you.",
        "Brooke: What happened? I mean, did Eric have a change of heart?",
        "Ridge: No, it was Quinn's idea.",
        "Eric: Before we start this family meeting, I just wanted to check and be sure that you're okay with all this.",
        "Steffy: Dad and I already discussed it. I'm cool with it.",
        "Eric: Good, I'm glad to hear that.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, it's gonna be fun working with my father. It's an honor.",
        "Quinn: You're gonna make a fantastic team.",
        "Steffy: There's one thing I'm curious about. Why are you doing this for my father?",
        "Pam: Well, it sounds like your trip was a blast.",
        "Zende: No, it was a great time seeing my folks, but, you know, being away made me realize what I was missing here, so I came back early.",
        "Rick: Hey! We're supposed to have a meeting with dad.",
        "Pam: Yep. Get in line.",
        "Maya: Well, did he say what it was about?",
        "Thomas: No, but I've got a pretty good idea.",
        "C.J.: It's not too late to call the demolition crew. You know, you'd be saving everyone, especially me, a whole lot of trouble.",
        "Shirley: Sally, honey, to be honest, I think C.J. has a point.",
        "Sally: Pass! Why can't you guys see what I see? We are going to make this old broad shine again. She is going to be gorgeous!",
        "C.J.: Oh, so just because you're sally spectra's niece, you think you know what it takes to run a fashion house? Seriously? I'm her son. I couldn't save the company.",
        "Shirley: [Laughs] That's for sure.",
        "Sally: We promised aunt sally that we were gonna give this place another shot. And you agreed to rent it to me.",
        "C.J.: All right, fine. Fine. Dig your own grave. You got 6 months to show a profit. Otherwise, this \"old broad\" has got a date with a wrecking ball.",
        "C.J.: Sally, I had an all-cash offer on the table before you came along. The only reason I am doing this is because you are family.",
        "Shirley: Sally, honey, six months is really not enough. I think we'll need at least a year turn a profit!",
        "C.J.: What? No. Unh-unh. Unh-unh. If you guys cannot handle it, I'm calling my guy right now.",
        "Sally: Unh-unh! Put that phone back in your pocket, C.J.! Grammy and I are ready to rock and roll. We are in it to win it. Not only are we preserving these weathered walls. We are saving the spectra family legacy.",
        "Rick: Well, hopefully dad's come to his senses, decided to offer me the C.E.O. position.",
        "Maya: That'd be nice.",
        "Rick: Mm-hmm.",
        "Pam: And I'm afraid, uh, I've got some bad news. The interns ate all my lemon bars.",
        "Rick: Pam, who's in there? Should we just walk in?",
        "Pam: No, no, no, no.",
        "Nicole: Maybe we shock knock.",
        "Pam: No, I am under strict orders -- very strict orders by Eric. Nobody is supposed to go in there until he gives me the say-so. I -- no, I'm serious. Back up, people! No sudden moves!",
        "Quinn: You said you approve of your father being co-C.E.O.",
        "Steffy: I do. I just find it a little -- a little odd... actually, a little unbelievable that this was your idea, that you'd do anything nice for my father.",
        "Quinn: Well, obviously ridge is more than qualified. But if -- if I'm being honest, um, I -- really, I did this for Eric, to show commitment and unity and to help bring the family together.",
        "Brooke: Quinn's idea?",
        "Ridge: Yeah, it surprised me, too.",
        "Brooke: Uh, she despises you and you despise her, so what would make her do that?",
        "Ridge: I don't know. It's her way to stay in my dad's good graces, I guess. It's important to him. And what's important to me is that I get to run this company with my daughter, and my beautiful fianc\u00e9e is back in my arms. All's well that ends well.",
        "Brooke: Mm-hmm.",
        "Sally: Listen up, boys and girls. We are Spectras, and Spectras are not quitters! We never back down!",
        "C.J.: Sally, God knows I love your attitude, but be real. Come back to earth. You need a bankroll. Designers. Sewers. And you have nothing.",
        "Shirley: Yet.",
        "Sally: Have some faith! We are full steam ahead! We are ready to hire top- notch talent, the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me! But cheap. Very cheap.",
        "C.J.: Oh, okay, so I can see you've thought this through.",
        "Shirley: We could put an ad in the papers! \"Wanted -- interns for hot, new design house.\"",
        "Sally: Yes! That's the spirits, grams! I will post all over social media. You will see. People will be lined up down the block.",
        "C.J.: There are labor laws, you know. You do have to pay them.",
        "Sally: We will pay! Of course we'll pay! I have money saved up in the bank. You do have some money saved from the bakery, right?",
        "Shirley: Oh, yeah, a few bucks here and there.",
        "Sally: Oh! Aunt sally used to mention her star employee, the tailor! The tailor! What was his name?",
        "Shirley: Saul! Saul!",
        "Sally: Yes! Yes! Saul! Of course it's Saul! We need a Saul. The best of the best.",
        "Shirley: Sal, honey, I'm gonna go make a few phone calls. There's got to be a few of your aunt's contacts still hanging around from her heyday.",
        "C.J.: No money, no staff, no business plan. Aunt Shirley should keep on walking if she's knows what's good for her.",
        "Sally: Yes, but we've got passion and determination. And that is all we need! And a little imagination.",
        "C.J.: Hey! Great! Look out new York and Milan! Spectra fashions is back! Whoo- hoo!",
        "Sally: Make yourself useful, would you? Take a picture of me at my new desk.",
        "C.J.: [Sighs] Oh, this is gonna be interesting.",
        "Eric: Well, good. We're all here. Thanks, everybody, for coming.",
        "Rick: Hey, it's good to see you back, dad.",
        "Maya: Yeah, we miss seeing you around, Eric.",
        "Brooke: Although you've obviously been quite busy.",
        "Pam: Even with Quinn hovering around.",
        "Zende: Yeah, granddad. The fall collection? Phenomenal.",
        "Eric: [Laughs] Thank you. That means a lot to me, Zende. It does. I think I'm pretty inspired these days. That's mainly because of my beautiful wife. Less stress. More time to design. I've really enjoyed working from home. Especially knowing that everything's being so well-managed here. Steffy, you're doing a great job. I think back on our history, we really haven't had any real conflict for a very long time. And the troubles we've had in the past were mainly because of one person -- sally spectra.",
        "Ridge: I haven't heard that name in a long time.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, talk about a blast from the past.",
        "Maya: I think I've read about her. Big hair?",
        "Eric: Yes. Big hair. And a big personality to match.",
        "Nicole: Wait. Who's sally spectra?",
        "Thomas: She ran the rival fashion house. She was one of our fiercest competitors.",
        "Pam: Yeah. Stephanie told me all the stories. She stole all your designs, right?",
        "Eric: [Laughing] Yes. Year after year. Ridge and I were ripped off many, many times.",
        "Zende: Wait. How can someone get away with that?",
        "Brooke: Sally had spies in her organization. Even ours at times.",
        "Zende: Wow.",
        "Rick: Yeah, sally would stop at nothing to create knock-offs, even if it was thread for thread.",
        "Eric: But much lower quality. And a lower price point, too.",
        "Brooke: She even made sure her showings were just before ours.",
        "Nicole: So yours would be ruined.",
        "Rick: Yeah. Months and months of hard work down the drain.",
        "Maya: That's horrible.",
        "Eric: That's sally. Huge personality, as you say, larger than life. Actually, a very charming woman, except when it came to business. When it came to business, she was a real shark.",
        "Zende: Is she still in fashion?",
        "Rick: Nah. Spectra folded years ago.",
        "Pam: I heard that she moved to an island somewhere.",
        "Quinn: Well, at least she's no longer a threat.",
        "Eric: No, actually, I read that they're thinking of tearing down her old building downtown. I only mention it because we've had this great period of calm. We haven't had any big conflicts like that for a very long time. The company's been flourishing and it's because Steffy's been doing such a good job as C.E.O. But I'm making some changes, significant changes in the executive team. I've spoken to Steffy about this, and she has agreed to share the C.E.O. Position with someone as talented and as devoted as she is, someone I'm very proud to call my son. Everybody, I want to introduce to you the new co-C.E.O. of Forrester Creations, my son... ridge Forrester.",
        "Rick: [Scoffs]",
        "C.J.: You have to be sure about this, sally.",
        "Sally: What? You really don't think I can do this, do you?",
        "C.J.: Oh, I definitely have my doubts, but that's -- that's not what's going on with me. I --",
        "Sally: Then what?",
        "C.J.: It's just a little weird for me to say your name -- sally spectra.",
        "Sally: Well, that is my name. Don't wear it out. I have idolized your mom since I was a little girl. She's the whole reason that I got into fashion. There's just not a lot of fashion opportunities back home.",
        "C.J.: But idolization and dreaming are one thing, and the business world is another. My mom was spectra fashions, and doing it without her is risky. She is one of a kind, a hell of a lady.",
        "Sally: I know. Tell me more about her, C.J. Tell me about the great sally spectra.",
        "Rick: No way! No, dad. You're making ridge the C.E.O.? That's ridiculous.",
        "Eric: No, it's not, rick. That's the way it's gonna be. Look, you cannot forget how important you are as vice president and head of international.",
        "Rick: Yeah, I know how important I am. So why not give me a shot?",
        "Thomas: Hey, at least you got a shot at C.E.O., Rick. I wasn't even considered.",
        "Eric: Thomas, I want to remember how important you are to this company. You're -- you're one of the hottest up-and-coming designers in the industry today. You're only getting better!",
        "Zende: You're good with this? Sharing your job with ridge?",
        "Steffy: Dad's the creative. I handle P.R. And all the business aspects. It's a nice balance.",
        "Rick: Nice balance. What about Quinn?",
        "Eric: She stays as president.",
        "Rick: Oh, of course. Yeah. Team Quinn. Whoo!",
        "Eric: That's enough. Look, this whole decision to me was an absolute no- brainer. Ridge, you've devoted your whole life to this company. You've been there, you understand the pressures. No one's had more influence over this company than you. Including me.",
        "Ridge: Thank you, dad. It means a lot hearing you say that.",
        "Eric: I have to give the credit to my wife. This was her idea.",
        "Maya: This was Quinn's idea?",
        "Rick: To make ridge C.E.O.?",
        "Ridge: Co-C.E.O.",
        "Eric: It was her suggestion, and Steffy got on board and so did I.",
        "Rick: Oh, come on, Quinn. We all know you can't stand ridge.",
        "Quinn: My opinion of him has recently changed.",
        "Eric: Pam, Nicole, Maya, you're all incredibly important members of this family and of this team. Zende -- you, too. I'm so grateful to have all of you.",
        "Zende: Appreciate it, granddad.",
        "Eric: And, Brooke, your contributions go without saying.",
        "Ridge: I totally agree. Thank you, dad, for the opportunity. And thank you, Quinn, for suggesting it. And, Steffy, thank you for sharing your office with me.",
        "Steffy: My pleasure.",
        "Eric: I'm excited for you both. I can't wait to see what happens in the future.",
        "Ridge: We'll do you proud, dad.",
        "Eric: I'm sure you will.",
        "C.J.: I mean... gosh, what can I say? My mom is great. She doesn't have a care in the world.",
        "Sally: That's music to my ears. I talked to her on the phone, but I would love to see her again someday.",
        "C.J.: There is nothing like hanging out with my mom, that's for sure. Just being in her presence, she's just got that -- that energy, that spirit. It's infectious, you know? Oh, and if she trusts you, likes you, lets you in, that's it. Done deal. You got a friend for life. Roll tape on a journey so much excitement ahead each day's a new adventure that keeps us moving ahead let's give it all we got for every perfect shot with the cameras all in focus let's start our daily soapy opus what we share share in this home proud of so many days we have one constant goal beauty remains hope never ends and we are forever bold we are forever bold",
        "Sally: Aunt Sally is the quintessential grande dame. A living legend. I know how much she loves this old relic. She told me that I was her last hope. And I won't let her down.",
        "Pam: Why is everybody so gloomy? This is good news!",
        "Maya: What's good about it, Pam?",
        "Pam: The family's coming back together. Steffy's been doing a really great job. And now ridge is back where he belongs.",
        "Thomas: Well, I think rick and I are probably feeling the same way, and... when it's gonna be our turn?",
        "Rick: And why Quinn is suddenly supporting ridge.",
        "Eric: That didn't go too horribly.",
        "Quinn: You handled that very well.",
        "Eric: I just wish that rick and Thomas weren't so disappointed.",
        "Quinn: Mm, they both know you love them very much. Hopefully, they know that you're doing what you think is best.",
        "Eric: Always so supportive, making things better.",
        "Quinn: You know what, I made you a promise -- you and I were gonna handle this together -- and I'm gonna keep it.",
        "Eric: Wow. Lucky me. You are so amazing. You surprise me every day.",
        "Quinn: Can't become too predictable.",
        "Eric: [Chuckles] Better not. I know much you used to worry about letting me down, but that's impossible. That could never happen.",
        "[Both moaning]",
        "Ridge: You've been away for too long.",
        "Brooke: Oh, Ridge. I can't do this here.",
        "Ridge: Why? We used to do it here all the time!",
        "Brooke: I know.",
        "Ridge: You know I don't like being a grown-up. That's not easy for me. But I'm co-C.E.O. of this company, so I better act like it.",
        "Brooke: That's right. Yes.",
        "Ridge: Okay.",
        "Brooke: And I'm very proud of you, by the way. I am confuse, however. You led the charge against Quinn for so many months. And now she's supporting you.",
        "Ridge: Hmm, well... well, that's common sense. I'm the lead designer and she wants to be on my good side.",
        "Brooke: So, you're just saying that Quinn has changed? No, no, no. That doesn't sound like her.",
        "Ridge: [Sighs] I don't know, maybe the divorce, you know, Steffy and Wyatt, that was the tipping point because she used the C.E.O. position to try to push them together, and now that Steffy is with Liam, she's given up.",
        "Brooke: Hmm. No, there's got to be more to it for her to do an about-face like that. Ridge? Is there anything else? Anything at all that happened while I was gone?",
        "Ridge: No. Nothing. Nothing at all."
