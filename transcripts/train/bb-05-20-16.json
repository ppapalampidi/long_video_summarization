        "Zende tells Nicole that he did not expect to feel this way; it blew his mind. He never should have left her. He has never been in more awe when he saw that baby in Maya's arms. Sasha tells Julius that she is glad the baby is healthy and all. Julius finds it hard to believe that Sasha can be that happy about this and that it probably means that Zende will get back with Nicole. Clearly they are both in love. So she and Zende had their fun but now it is over. She remarks that she is not going anywhere, she is pregnant. Katie goes berserk that here her husband is half naked and Brooke pops out from under the bed and that is what she walked in on. She caught them in the act. Bill says he knows it looks bad but it is not what she is saying. She is getting upset for no reason. Brooke says she did not even know Bill was there. Katie says Brooke is better than that. She does not believe she was not trying to seduce her husband but came over to do something nice for Katie. Such luck that Brooke has, just dropping by and suddenly finding Bill standing there without his clothes .and now the worst part is trying to make Katie believe this. Zende tells Nicole he is so sorry what he put her through. It was a big mistake. Sasha is a great person but it does not change how he feels about Nicole. Katie goes downstairs and pours herself a drink. Bill tries to stop her. She says he got to do what he wanted to do so now she will too. So Brooke needs to stop trying to make people think she is delusional. Bill says when she gets like this they cannot talk. Nothing happened. She won't let Bill have the bottle. She says she does not want to feel like this yet here she is. He should have told Brooke to leave the minute he found her in the bedroom. She tells Brooke to get the hell out of her house. She locks herself in her room and won't let Brooke or Bill come in, tells them to go away. He refuses to see what Brooke is doing, so there is no need in talking.",
        "Julius says he is starting to talk to his family again so he can confirm this pregnancy. Sasha says they do not know yet. He thinks it is awfully convenient that the minute Nicole has the baby and gets back with Zende that Sasha finds out suddenly that she is pregnant and yes Zende will do the right thing and stay with her. Nicole tells Zende that she told him from the beginning how she felt so she does not blame him. He says he loves her and wants another chance. He thinks he can get through anything now. They hug. Katie holds the bottle, thinks back on her wedding day and things Bill said and then the birth of Will. And Bill saying he does not want to lose her. She puts the bottle aside and does not want it after all. Despite what Bill says, Brooke says this was all her fault and she should go. Bill says Katie is locked in her bedroom and will not come back out now. Bill says no matter what he does it does not seem to help. She says Katie is lucky to have him. She is worried about her so take care of her. She hugs Bill. Nicole tells Zende that she missed him so much. He thinks their relationship is stronger and they can get through anything. Nothing is going to stop them this time. But he has news that is not good but they can't let it change things. He states that he went to see Sasha and she was happy for Nicole and the baby and said the same thing was gonna happen to her. She is pregnant."

        "Zende: I didn't expect to feel this way. It's kind of overwhelming.",
        "Nicole: You're telling me.",
        "Zende: Seeing Rick and Maya with their little girl... what you did was so incredible. I had no idea what it really meant to have a baby until then.",
        "Nicole: I don't think anybody does. Until it happens to you.",
        "Zende: I shouldn't have left you.",
        "Nicole: You came back. That's all that matters.",
        "Sasha: I'm glad Nic's all right and the baby's healthy and everything, but I just don't see what that has to do with Zende and me.",
        "Julius: I heard that, uh, Zende was at the hospital for the birth.",
        "Sasha: Yeah. He told me.",
        "Julius: Now, you understand what that means? I mean, he saw Nicole give her sister an incredible gift.",
        "Sasha: I'm glad.",
        "Julius: He was deeply moved, Sasha.",
        "Sasha: I just said that's great.",
        "Julius: Somehow I find that hard to believe.",
        "Sasha: It's true. Zende saw Nicole having a baby. He witnessed the miracle of birth, an experience that can completely change people's lives.",
        "[Insects chirping]",
        "Katie: Brooke!",
        "Brooke: I-I'm sorry.",
        "Katie: What the hell?! What the hell are you doing in my bedroom?!",
        "Bill: Katie, listen, it's not --",
        "Katie: What is she doing here?!",
        "Brooke: I'm leaving.",
        "Katie: You were hiding under the bed?!",
        "Bill: It's not in any way what you think.",
        "Katie: It's not?! Because I'm thinking that you were standing here half-naked and my sister just crawled out from under the bed!",
        "Brooke: No, I-I know. I don't know why I did that. It was ridiculous, really. It's just I heard you coming and I knew what this would look like --",
        "Katie: Stop. Stop it. Stop talking. I don't want to hear any excuses. It is obvious that you were seducing my husband and that's what I walked in on. So, that's what this is. I caught you in the act!",
        "Bill: All right, listen. Listen, I will give you that it looks bad, but it's not.",
        "Katie: [Chuckles incredulously]",
        "Bill: In fact, it's nothing.",
        "Katie: Nothing?!",
        "Brooke: I didn't even know he was here. I was bringing something for you, something special for tonight, something that you could wear -- a beautiful dress. I will show you. It's right over here in the closet. He surprised me when he came out of the shower. Anyway, I got this for you. It's gorgeous. I left you a little note.",
        "Katie: So, you weren't trying to seduce my husband? You were just doing something nice for me?",
        "Brooke: Exactly.",
        "Katie: You're gonna have to do better than that, because I'm not buying this excuse for one second.",
        "Julius: Zende may have a whole new appreciation for Nicole's decision to be a surrogate.",
        "Sasha: Yeah, I think he's starting to see the baby thing in a whole new light.",
        "Julius: And he may be feeling that, uh, ending it because of the pregnancy was a mistake.",
        "Sasha: Good to know.",
        "Julius: They're still in love. And he may be feeling that, um, maybe he shouldn't have left her.",
        "Sasha: But he did leave her. For me.",
        "Julius: Listen, now that Nicole has had the baby, I think you should do the honorable thing and just back off. I mean, you and Zende had your fun, but it's over. You've got to go your separate ways.",
        "Sasha: I'm afraid that's not possible, dad. I'm not going anywhere.",
        "Julius: And what's that supposed to mean?",
        "Sasha: I'm pregnant.",
        "Zende: When you put that beautiful little girl into Maya's arms, that's when I realized I was the one being selfish. You said that we could work it out, everything would be fine.",
        "Nicole: And now it is.",
        "Zende: What you did was so amazing. I mean, the generosity, the strength you showed. I have never been more in awe of anyone. And I'd give anything to have you back.",
        "Brooke: I knew you were going to the museum benefit, and I saw this gown. It's beautiful.",
        "Katie: I have a whole closet full of beautiful gowns, Brooke.",
        "Bill: Brooke was being thoughtful, Katie.",
        "Katie: Thoughtful? Is that what you're going with?",
        "Bill: You're getting upset for no reason.",
        "Katie: No reason?! She was hiding under our bed! So, you thought you'd surprise me?",
        "Brooke: Yes.",
        "Katie: So you knew I wouldn't be home.",
        "Brooke: I didn't think anybody would be home.",
        "Katie: But you couldn't be sure about that. There was a chance that Bill might be home. See, this is what you do. This is classic Brooke. You don't mean to hurt anyone or cause any trouble, but things just happen to you. You didn't come over here looking for Bill. You came over to bring me a dress to be nice. And the minute you step foot in my bedroom, out comes my husband fresh out of the shower. But that's not your fault. No, no, no, no. That's just your luck. And the most insulting part of this is the two of you are standing here refusing to acknowledge it!",
        "Bill: Katie, what are you doing? Where are you going? Katie!",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Julius: Am I supposed to believe that Zende is the father?",
        "Sasha: Of course he is.",
        "Julius: Well, I had to ask.",
        "Sasha: No, you didn't, because you wouldn't have asked Nicole that question.",
        "Julius: Nicole wouldn't have gotten herself in this position. If that's what's really going on here.",
        "Zende: I hope you understand. I felt like I was losing you. I didn't know where I fit in all this.",
        "Nicole: You had a right to feel that way.",
        "Zende: No, I took the easy way out -- leaving, getting involved with Sasha. I am so sorry I put you through that. It was a mistake.",
        "Nicole: It did hurt me when you got involved with her.",
        "Zende: I am sorry. I feel bad about that, too. I mean, don't get me wrong. Sasha's a great person. She was there for me. But it hurt you. You know, the truth is, I wish it never happened. But it doesn't change the way I feel about you, Nicole.",
        "Bill: Katie.",
        "Katie: Oh, good. You're here. I poured you a drink. And one for you, too, because I'm sure as hell not gonna drink by myself.",
        "Brooke: I don't want that, and neither do you.",
        "Katie: Oh, if there was ever a time for a drink, now is that time.",
        "Bill: Don't do it, Katie.",
        "Katie: Why? You get to do what you want to do. I should get to do what I want to do!",
        "Bill: This is not what I want!",
        "Katie: Of course it is! Because you're never going to convince me that a man of your intelligence can't see something that is so obvious!",
        "Bill: Brooke told you why she's here! You saw the dress!",
        "Katie: If nothing was going on, why did you panic when I came in the room?",
        "Brooke: I wasn't thinking. I just reacted.",
        "Katie: Because you felt guilty. Admit it.",
        "Bill: Because she didn't want to upset you!",
        "Katie: She didn't want me to see the look on her face, because she was thinking about all those times the two of you had together in Abu Dhabi and Monte Carlo and aspen and all those amazing times you spent together in our bed!",
        "Brooke: Katie, stop.",
        "Katie: No, you stop!",
        "Brooke: [Sighs]",
        "Katie: You stop trying to convince everyone that I'm delusional and that my suspicions are crazy when we both know they're not!",
        "Bill: Listen to me. I understand that you're angry and what you saw set you off, justifiably. Brooke shouldn't have hid under the bed. I should have told you she was there. But now here we are. And when you get like this, you're not reasonable.",
        "Katie: No! No! This is not my problem. You allow it. You allow every excuse, every justification! You allow it!",
        "Bill: Nothing happened.",
        "Katie: [Scoffs] [Chuckles] That's right. Nothing happened. She didn't rip your towel off. She didn't throw herself at you. She just wanted one little moment. That's it. Just to feel that thrill. Because she's an addict and she can't help herself.",
        "Bill: Give me the bottle.",
        "Katie: No.",
        "Bill: We have to talk, and we can't talk when you are drinking!",
        "Katie: What are you gonna say? Hmm? You gonna defend her? Because I'll definitely need a drink if that's what you're gonna say.",
        "Bill: I am not gonna let you do this to yourself, Katie.",
        "Katie: You know, I didn't want a drink tonight. Didn't even cross my mind. All I wanted to do was go out on the town with my husband. I didn't want to feel like this. And yet here I am. You put me in this position. You should have told her to leave as soon as you saw her in our bedroom, but you didn't. And that's why I have to. Get the hell out of my house.",
        "[Insects chirping]",
        "[Lock clicks]",
        "Katie: [Sighs]",
        "Bill: Katie, open the door!",
        "Katie: No!",
        "Brooke: Please don't do this. You and Bill had such a wonderful evening --",
        "Katie: What are you still doing here?! I told you to leave!",
        "Brooke: I will leave once you come out and you give Bill the bottle.",
        "Katie: Just go away!",
        "Brooke: I should go.",
        "Katie: [Sighs]",
        "Bill: Katie, Brooke isn't leaving! Now open the door so we can talk this out!",
        "Katie: What's the point when you refuse to see what she's doing? Just go away.",
        "Julius: So I'm to believe that you are pregnant with Zende's child?",
        "Sasha: I found out last night. I took a home pregnancy test.",
        "Julius: While it may not be the best relationship, but I am starting to talk to my family again, so I can confirm this, you know.",
        "Sasha: They don't know.",
        "Julius: [Scoffs] Of course they don't.",
        "Sasha: I mean, unless Zende told them.",
        "Julius: He knows? Wait a minute. What am I saying? Of course, he knows. [Chuckles] I mean, how else were you gonna hold on to him? I mean, it's no -- no coincidence that the moment that he decides to express that he wants to get back with Nicole that you decide to announce that you're pregnant with his child! How could you do this to Nicole and Zende?! They're just on the verge of getting back together!",
        "Sasha: I don't think that's gonna happen.",
        "Julius: Yeah. Well, maybe it won't. Or maybe Zende won't care any more about your pregnancy than he did Nicole's. But if he's the kind of man that I know him to be, you're right. He won't turn his back on you. He'll do what he has to do to take care of his child, even if it means it ruins his life.",
        "Zende: I didn't want to break up. I wanted everything to be the way that it was before you agreed to be Maya's surrogate. I wanted everything to be simple and uncomplicated. And if I had any idea that this would happen, that -- that I would feel this way being in the room with you giving birth, the way that I feel with you right now, I would have never left your side.",
        "Nicole: I didn't blame you for leaving me, Zende.",
        "Zende: Because you're a good person.",
        "Nicole: So are you. You were honest with me from the beginning.",
        "Zende: And I want to be honest with you now. I never stopped loving you, Nicole. Your goodness, your beauty -- I need that. I need you in my life. I left because I was confused, but not anymore. No, I learned something important today. And it may not be simple and uncomplicated, but I know I can get through whatever the future throws my way if you are by my side. I love you, Nicole. Will you give me another chance?",
        "Nicole: Yes. [Chuckles] [Sighs] I still love you, too.",
        "Bill: Katie, you have me for support. Think about our life, our family, everything we've built. You have brought so much to my life. I love you, Katie. And I will love you each and every day until the day I die.",
        "Katie: Your daddy is so silly. What are we gonna do with him?",
        "Katie: What's wrong with me tonight?",
        "Bill: Oh, look at that. Mommy spilled a little bit.",
        "Katie: Where are you going?",
        "Bill: Come here.",
        "Katie: Where are you going? We're having dinner.",
        "Bill: Go with Daddy.",
        "Will: No!",
        "Bill: Yeah, we're gonna go wash your car.",
        "Will: No!",
        "Bill: I don't want to lose you again, Katie.",
        "Katie: You won't. I promise I won't let that happen.",
        "Brooke: Maybe I should go.",
        "Bill: She won't come out.",
        "Brooke: Has she ever done this before?",
        "Bill: No.",
        "Brooke: So it was my fault.",
        "Bill: I told you it's not.",
        "Brooke: I was hiding under the bed. I mean, what was I thinking?",
        "Bill: And you could have been standing in the middle of the room, Brooke, and Katie would have reacted the same way.",
        "Brooke: No, that's not true. Things have been better with us, and she wasn't drinking.",
        "Bill: Now she's locked in the bedroom with a bottle of whiskey.",
        "Brooke: I think you should go back up there and try to reason with her.",
        "Bill: There is no reasoning with her when she's like this.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] This doesn't make sense. I mean, Katie is always the most level-headed person that I know.",
        "Bill: It's one of the reasons I married her. My hot temper -- she helps keep a lid on it. I depend on her for that.",
        "Brooke: And she depends on you.",
        "Bill: [Sighs] No matter what I do, it doesn't seem to help.",
        "Brooke: You're trying, and that's what's important. Katie's lucky to have you. I-if you need anything, just let me know, okay? If you need help with will or with Katie, I'm here.",
        "Bill: Thanks.",
        "Brooke: Take care of her. I am worried about her.",
        "Bill: Me, too.",
        "Nicole: I told myself it was over, to stop thinking about you. I missed you so much.",
        "Zende: I missed you, too. You know, uh, you said, uh, our relationship was stronger than I knew and that we could get through anything.",
        "Nicole: We can.",
        "Zende: I lost you once. I won't lose you again.",
        "Nicole: I'm not going anywhere.",
        "Zende: I hope that's true. I let circumstances stop me from having the future that I wanted with you. But nothing's gonna stop us this time. But there's something I have to tell you, and it's not good news. We can't let it change things for us.",
        "Nicole: It won't. Look at us. There's nothing we can't handle.",
        "Zende: It's Sasha. When I went to see her to tell her that I love you and I wanted to have a future with you, she gave me some truth of her own.",
        "Nicole: I'll bet she did. Zende, you can't let that get to you. She doesn't want to lose you. She'll say things and... what did she say?",
        "Zende: She said she was happy I was here to witness the birth of the baby, that it was good for me to see how magical it is to bring a child into this world.",
        "Nicole: Sasha did? Why would she say that?",
        "Zende: Because it's gonna happen to us next. Sasha's pregnant."
