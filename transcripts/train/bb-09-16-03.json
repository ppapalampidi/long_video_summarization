        "Ridge is demanding that Stephanie make peace and give her blessings for his and Brooke's wedding. Stephanie doesn't give much of a response in front of Ridge. When he leaves Brooke and Stephanie alone, Brooke starts in with her bratty attitude and Stephanie tells her that it will be \"a cold day in hell\" when she gives them her blessings. Brooke responds that Ridge will be very disappointed. Warning her not to gloat, smart Alec Brooke grabs a fake bouquet and tosses it at Stephanie's feet. Later on, Sally meets up with Stephanie at her new office. She wants to know what happened with Brooke, half expecting bad news. When Stephanie tells her what happened, Sally needs a drink. The two of them got sloshed and Stephanie falls on the floor. Sally helps her up and then gives her a makeover. She plops a potted plant on Stephanie's head and stars chopping away. They are gabbing and Stephanie tells Sally she should come work for them. When Sally is done, Stephanie's hair is about 2 inches long all over her head, a look Stephanie declares as \"hip-hop !\" Bridet is still being held by the fake doctor. Oscar isn't much help but Bridget elbows the goon and he falls to the floor when she bonks him on the head with a tray. The cops come and take him away and Bridget asks Oscar what kind of trouble he is in. Brooke is admiring her diamond ring when in comes Nick. He wants her to be happy. He has a gift for her. She opens it and finds a bracelet with a compass dangling from it. He says she should use it when she feels lost. Their conversation is halted when Ridge raises a ladder to the window and expects Brooke to elope with him."

        "Brooke: That's a lovely gesture, Ridge.",
        "Ridge: Better come off sounding sincere, too.",
        "Stephanie: You're leaving?",
        "Ridge: Oh, I'm through putting words in your mouth, Mother. This is your last chance to get it right. You see, Brooke and I have decided to have a private ceremony. Which means the next time you lay eyes on her, she will be my wife. So, I suggest you open your arms to her and accept her into this family. That is if you'd like to hold onto your family.",
        "Brooke: Go ahead, Stephanie. Make my day.",
        "Oscar: I said leave her alone.",
        "Thug: How you gonna stop me, huh?",
        "Bridget: No, don't! Don't!",
        "Thug: Shut up! Shut up!",
        "[Muffled screaming]",
        "Thug: Hey!",
        "[Crash]",
        "Bridget: Oh, my god!",
        "Oscar: Hmm, yeah. Way to go.",
        "Brooke: I'm waiting.",
        "Stephanie: It'll be a cold day in hell before you get my blessing.",
        "Brooke: Ridge will be very disappointed that you took the low road.",
        "Stephanie: First, last and always, Ridge is my son. And at the end of the day, he will always side with his mother. Just they way he did when he voted you out of Forrester.",
        "Brooke: He did that so we could start a company together, so we could build a future together.",
        "Stephanie: Logan Designs is not a demonstration of his loyalty to you. It is merely a way to placate you.",
        "Brooke: You're just upset because you were outwitted. You really thought you had your revenge. Well, you know what, Stephanie? It's over. Because you lost, and I won.",
        "Stephanie: What did you win? A Forrester wannabe? A shadow of the company that you used to run?",
        "Brooke: We're going to turn this into the preeminent design house. We're going to be like what you and Eric used to be.",
        "Stephanie: Eric and I had commitment and respect and love on our side. Real love.",
        "Brooke: When are you going to realize that that's what Ridge and I have, too?",
        "Stephanie: You aren't capable of real love.",
        "Brooke: I will do anything for Ridge. I'll be the best daughter-in-law that you could ever have. I'll be the best mother to his children. I'll be the best wife to Ridge. And I'll be a good friend to you. So, please, Stephanie, what do you say? Can we just end this war? Let's call it a truce.",
        "Stephanie: You know, once you start living in the house, he's going to start comparing you to Taylor.",
        "Brooke: He won't!",
        "Stephanie: Have I hit a nerve?",
        "Brooke: No one will come between us, Stephanie. I am wearing Ridge's ring now. And it'll stay on forever. And just think -- you're the one who put it there.",
        "Stephanie: Don't gloat. Because if you don't treat those children better than you treated --",
        "Brooke: Or what? What are you going to do?",
        "Stephanie: I promised Taylor those babies would be raised the way she wanted them raised.",
        "Brooke: You know what, Stephanie? You're not going to bait me anymore. I promised Ridge that I would be nice to you. And I'm going to make him proud. I'll miss you at the wedding, Mom. Oops. Better luck next time.",
        "Security #1: Let's go, punk. Police want to talk to you.",
        "Oscar: Yeah, make sure you check out the syringe real good. He tried to jack my IV with whatever's in it.",
        "Security #1: Thanks.",
        "Security #2: We'll do that.",
        "Nurse: You were very lucky. Pulse and heart rate are normal, but I'm going to get Dr. Cooper just in case.",
        "Bridget: Thank you. If this keeps up, they're gonna have to start teaching self-defense classes in premed.",
        "Oscar: Whoa, whoa, whoa. You're a student?",
        "Bridget: Yeah.",
        "Oscar: See, now here I thought with moves like that you were a full-fledged doctor. So, tell me, what's it like having to learn all those medical tongue twisters?",
        "Bridget: Hey, can we get back to what just happened here, please?",
        "Oscar: Oh, yeah, that. You know, I don't know. That dude probably has a problem with guys in hospital gowns.",
        "Bridget: The truth. What kind of trouble are you in?",
        "Stephanie: Sally?",
        "Sally: So? Tell me what happened. Did the wildcat go quietly or did she try to scratch your eyes out?",
        "Stephanie: Sally --",
        "sally: Listen, it's okay. You don't have to spare me anything here. Just tell me the truth. What did Brooke say when you told her that Ridge was not going to hand over my company to her?",
        "Stephanie: I couldn't convince him not to do that. I'm sorry, Sally.",
        "Sally: It's okay. I was halfway expecting you to say that anyway.",
        "Stephanie: You know, he just -- he just has blinders on when it comes to this woman.",
        "Sally: You know something? I could really use a drink.",
        "Stephanie: You know, when this office was mine a long time ago, Eric used to keep a bottle hidden away just for special occasions. Maybe he did this time, too. It's Irish.",
        "Sally: Sacred liquid.",
        "Stephanie: Here's looking at you, kid.",
        "Sally: Up the long ladder, down the short rope.",
        "Both: Smooth.",
        "Oscar: Who says I'm in trouble?",
        "Bridget: You're really not gonna tell me what this was all about, are you? Even though I probably just saved your life?",
        "Oscar: And you never know when I'm gonna need you to do it again. So don't ask, okay?",
        "Bridget: Okay. I'm -- I'm gonna go check on some other patients. Are you okay?",
        "Oscar: Yeah, I'm good. You know, especially now since I got my own personal terminator and all.",
        "Bridget: Yeah. I was pretty fantastic, huh?",
        "Bridget: [Impersonating the terminator] \"I'll be back.\"",
        "Stephanie: And then she just turned and walked out on her high horse.",
        "Sally: That's terrible. That's terrible! The nerve of that woman. Bringing a horse into a swell office like this.",
        "Stephanie: Right!",
        "Sally: Shall we have another drink?",
        "Stephanie: Okay.",
        "Sally: Good.",
        "Stephanie: Let me hit you again.",
        "Sally: You know, I'm not going to hit you. I'm gonna save all my fisticuffs for that cut-rate vampira that stole my company.",
        "Stephanie: Boy, you said a mouthful on that one.",
        "Sally: You bet. I know how to talk. I could talk for days about that woman. You know, it's really nice being here with you like this. I mean, being on the same side for once is a nice change. You and I should've always been friends anyway, you know, because we're two of a kind. We're both survivors. We're like -- we're like cream. We always rise to the top.",
        "[Stephanie snoring]",
        "Sally: Stephanie? Is that you? Where are you, Stephanie? Huh? Where are you? Oh. Oh, how you doing over here? How you doing down here, huh? Huh? Hey? Hey? You okay? You okay? Huh?",

        "Stephanie: Stop yapping and start working.",
        "Sally: Oh, okay. Do you know something? My -- my Irish daddy always used to tell me -- he said, \"you're gonna do a thing right, you should always start at the top.\"",

        "Brooke: Nick.",
        "Nick: Marta said it was okay to come up. So when's the big day?",
        "Brooke: I don't know. Ridge is making all the plans, and he's kinda being mysterious about it.",
        "Nick: Makes it exciting. Probably doesn't want family interfering or any men from your past.",
        "Brooke: Any guy in particular you're referring to?",
        "Nick: No. I just wanna wish you and Forrester luck.",
        "[Polka music playing]",
        "Sally: Here comes the water. Every good hairdresser will tell you that it is best to cut hair when it's wet.",
        "Stephanie: Everybody knows that. You know, you might have a flair for this.",
        "Sally: You know, actually I think I do. I think I do. And it's a good thing, too. Because if the rag trade dries up and I can't get a gig there, I figure I could always get work as a mortician.",
        "Stephanie: A mortician?",
        "Sally: Ah! Excuse me.",
        "Stephanie: That's all right.",
        "Sally: There.",
        "Stephanie: Oh, good. Sally? Sally, why don't you come to work for us?",
        "Sally: Ha! That's a laugh. Ho, ho, ho, ho.",
        "Stephanie: Hey, we -- we could use a good --",
        "Sally: Huh?",
        "Stephanie: We could use a good -- whatever it is you do, Sally.",
        "Sally: You know, now wait a minute. You do owe me. You know that?",
        "Stephanie: Mm-hmm.",
        "Sally: Yeah, you owe me big.",
        "Stephanie: Mm-hmm.",
        "Sally: Yeah? Okay. So, in order for me to come work for you, i will make certain demands. For one thing, I want my own office with a big window.",
        "Stephanie: Okay.",
        "Sally: I want my own personal secretary -- a man.",
        "Stephanie: Okay.",
        "Sally: A big one.",

        "Brooke: I'm happy.",
        "Nick: Then that's all I need to hear.",
        "Brooke: Thank you.",
        "Nick: I bought you something.",
        "Brooke: A wedding present?",
        "Nick: Forrester can wear it if he wants, but in my opinion it'll look a little better on you.",
        "Brooke: Oh, it's beautiful. It's a compass.",
        "Nick: In case you lose your way.",
        "Brooke: You're an amazing man.",
        "Nick: Well, if I've learned one thing since I've met you, you can't go through life alone. It's nice to have a friend. So, if you ever need one, you know where to look.",

        "Brooke: What was that?",
        "Ridge: Hey, Logan! Get your butt down here!",

        "Nick: If you ever feel lost, just look at your compass.",
        "Brooke: Aye, aye, captain. Okay, you'd better catch me if I fall. This is kind of tricky. This is scary. In high heels no less. You think this is funny, don't you?",
        "Ridge: Oh, you can do it, Logan.",
        "Brooke: This is crazy. I can't believe I'm doing this. You are absolutely crazy.",
        "Ridge: And you're absolutely right. You're absolutely right. Told you I was gonna keep you on your toes. Come on, they're waiting for us on the runway.",
        "Brooke: Wait -- where are we going?",
        "Ridge: Where are we going? Where are we going? We're going to begin the rest of our lives together. That's where we're going. Come on. Come on, let's go.",
