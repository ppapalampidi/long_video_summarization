        "Ian learns that Frank's gambling problem may make him especially susceptible to accepting help from the wrong person. Stunned at the news of Ian's condition, Karen offers her support. Ian punches Kevin out for insulting Karen. Lucy and Elizabeth both instinctively know that something about Frank is \"off.\" Lucy sends Elizabeth to give Ian a note, which Frank is supposed to believe has something to do with shopping. Caleb tells himself that he can beat Joshua. When Joshua answers Livvie's call, he's displeased to find that she is working with a slayer. Rafe sends Livvie out of the room to prevent her from finding out that Caleb is alive. Temporarily banished, Livvie wanders around below the villa. Frank confirms Lucy's suspicion that he is now a vampire. Joshua lies about his reasons for taking the photos of Alison. Elizabeth rushes to the Recovery Room to get Ian. Lucy tries to keep Frank away from Alison, but Frank pushes her down and forcibly takes his terrified target with him. Before Rafe can drive the stake into Joshua's heart, Frank arrives with his hostage. Kevin and Karen share a moment of understanding. Ian and Elizabeth find Lucy on the floor and Alison nowhere in sight. Livvie and Caleb have an unexpected reunion when she ends up in front of his cell."

        "ian: All right, rafe, I'm just going to keep leaving messages on your machine. I'm still looking for frank. I have no idea where he is. I'm going to try the recovery room one more time. Got to find out why his name is on joshua's list. I hope you check this. Come on, frank, where are you?",
        "Kevin: Ah. Other one down. Now, where is that bartender?",
        "Ian: Oh, for god's sake.",

        "Kevin: Oh, if only.",
        "Ian: Got a lot of nerve showing up here after what you tried to do to me.",
        "Kevin: Call the cops. Oh, wait, we can't do that. Then you'd have to tell them what you are. That's right, vampire, walk away.",
        "Ian: There's a lot of things about this condition that might not get to me, but the one thing is that I can't really fight you because it wouldn't be fair. So I would love just 30 seconds of normalcy so I could kick your miserable ass -- just 30 seconds, tops.",
        "Karen: Ian, hey.",
        "Ian: Have you seen frank?",
        "Karen: No, I've been looking for him, too. I can't find him anywhere.",

        "Ian: Maybe we should --",
        "karen: No, no, no, ian, if it's not the gambling, what kind of trouble are we talking about?",

        "Frank: Can I come in?",
        "Lucy: No. I mean, you could, but you don't want to because, see, alison's mom, elizabeth, is here and she's telling us her life story and she's only up to her first prom, her first kiss or memething. You don't want to. Take your life in your own hands, don'T.",
        "Frank: Yeah, it's kind of important and it won't take long.",

        "Lucy: No, alison, don'T. Please don'T.",
        "Frank: Don't what? Is there a problem?",
        "Alison: I thk so. I really think that maybe she needs a good look-over. I was wondering if maybe you could do that.",
        "Frank: Well, I guess a paramedic counts as an expert opinn,n, but --",
        "lucy: Well, no, thanks, I -- really, I am fine. Frank, I'm sorry, I don't mean to be rude, but really, it's not a good time for me to talk right now if that's ok with you.",

        "Alison: Ok, I will.",
        "Lucy: Um -- you know, I think alison's right. I mean, I just need some extra protection, maybe.",
        "Frank: Maybe so.",
        "Lucy: Because I just can't shake this feeling.",
        "Frank: What feeling?",
        "Lucy: Frank, there's something really different about you. I just can't seem to put my finger on it.",
        "Caleb: It's not her voice, it's not her voice, it's --",
        "[Caleb sighs]",
        "Caleb: It was just joshua's cheap tricks.",
        "Caleb: Oh. Comen, get a grip. Focus, caleb, focus. He is new at this. He's new at this and you can beat him, even like this. You could still beat him.",
        "Livvie: All right, joshua, come to me. You can't just ignore my call and you can't stay away forever. And when you do get here, I promise I'll be ready for you.",
        "Livvie: Joshua.",

        "Karen: Well, so do I, but I've looked everywhere. I've looked at home, at work. I don't know where else to look. Kevi that sounds like a man who doesn't want to be found.",
        "Ian: How long has he been gambling?",
        "Karen: I don't know, but he's lost a lot of money and he's under a lot of pressure.",
        "Ian: What kind of pressure?",
        "Karen: Well, business at the bar has been down, so he's been working double shifts to try and make ends meet. So he thought if he got this one win, he would get back on his feet, butt't's just gotten worse.",
        "Ian: So he's pretty desperate, might -- might turn to anyone for help.",
        "Karen: What is it, ian? What are you thinking?",
        "Ian: I don't know. Nothing concrete.",
        "Karen: Well, for nothing concrete, you sure put your finger on it. That's exactly what I'm scared of frank getting involved in, that he's going to get mixed up with somebody, and he needs help before --",

        "Karen: You just don't know how bad it got last time.",

        "Kevin: Oh, I wasn't -- yes, I'm afraid dr. Thornhart? Vampire.",

        "Lucy: I don't think so.",
        "Frank: Listen --",
        "lucy: No, I always listen to my instincts, and they're telling me that something's really off, something's different about you.",

        "Lucy: Uh --",
        "elizabeth: No.",
        "Lucy: No, you know what, actually, you can't because -- you know, I just asked you, remember, to take this note I ian. I need you to do that right away. We forgot.",
        "Elizabeth: Yeah, um, and alison was going to come with me.",
        "Lucy: She'll be fine and I'll send her --",
        "elizabeth: Tell her to meet me immediately.",
        "Lucy: Right away, as soon as I can. And hurry. He's needing that note, so hurry.",
        "Elizabeth: Ok.",
        "Lucy: Thanks.",

        "Frank: Hmm. Elizabeth seemed pretty nervous when she read it",
        "lucy: Well, I'm really nervous now, frank, because there is definitely something different about you.",
        "Frank: Oh, you know how it is, lucy -- life throws you a curve, you roll with it.",

        "Frank: That's it. That's enough.",
        "Lucy: Frank -- frank --",

        "Lucy: Oh, my god. So it is true, you are a vampire.",

        "Man: Yo, morley. Enjoying chilling out?",
        "Caleb: Listen, whatever joshua promised you, I'll give you 10 times that. Just let me out. I'm more powerful than he'll ever be.",
        "Man: You're only mortal, man. Joshua's the master. I'd die for the boss.",
        "Caleb: Yeah? Well, you may end up just doing that. Hey, old time's sake -- those voices, who's out there?",
        "Man: Beats me. The boss. Some guy and a chick.",
        "Caleb: Olivia.",
        "Caleb: Olivia.",
        "Rafe: What's the matter, josh, surprised to see me?",
        "Joshua: You could say that, yes.",
        "Livvie: Then again, life is full of surprises, isn't it?",
        "Joshua: You know, to be honest with you, I didn't expect this. I didn't expect it in the slightest. How could you do this, take the side of a slayer against your own kind?",
        "Livvie: But my own kind killed my husband, remember? My own kind killed caleb, the man I love. And if I had to make a deal with the devil himself, I'd get you back for his murder.",
        "Joshua: Murdered? Caleb? Well, now, isn't that an interesting version of the truth, rafe?",
        "Rafe: You wouldn't know the truth if it walked up and drove you through with a stake.",
        "Livvie: Truth? What does he mean, the truth?",
        "Rafe: Come here. You know better than to listen to anything this guys says. Now, wait for me outside and I'll finish this, all right?",
        "Livvie: But --",
        "rafe: No, listen to what I said! Go!",
        "Rafe: Now, where were we?",
        "Joshua: You know, she didn't have to leave the room. I don't want her to know that caleb's alive any more than you do, so we do have something in common.",
        "Rafe: No, we don't have anything in common.",
        "Joshua: All right, all I was simply saying was that we have --",
        "rafe: Joshua, I came here to kill you. You do understand that, right? Now, it can be fast or it can be slow. It's really up to you.",
        "Joshua: All right, I'm listening.",
        "Rafe: Ok. Now, I came across your twisted handiwork, you know, underneath your nice little painting of port charles, your little collage of photos.",
        "Joshua: Is that what this is about?",
        "Rafe: Now, listen to me -- because you got one shot and one shot only. You're going to tell me what you're doing with those pictures of alison, and you're going to tell me now.",
        "Karen: Ian's a vampire? That's crazy. You're crazy.",
        "Kevin: You mean he didn't tell you about his change in culinary style?",
        "Ian: Collins --",
        "kevin: No, I'll tell anyone I want what you are. Consider it payback for the way you and everyone else hunted my daughter.",
        "Karen: Ian, please tell me he's lying.",
        "Ian: He's telling the truth.",
        "Karen: Oh, my god.",
        "Ian: But I'm fighting it with everything I've got.",
        "Kevin: Yeah, including my wife.",
        "Ian: Yeah, lucy's helping me through this and we love each other, and there's nothing you can do about that.",
        "Karen: Ian, I'm sorry. I don't know what to say.",
        "Ian: It'll be all right.",
        "Karen: Is there anything I can do?",
        "Kevin: You got to be kidding me. You're going to give him sympathy now?",
        "Ian: Backffff.",
        "Kevin: No wonder frank took off. He probably couldn't take the whining.",
        "Karen: It's ok.",
        "Kevin: But then if you opened your eyes, you'd be able to separate the good guys from the bad.",
        "Ian: Last chance, collins.",
        "Kevin: Oh, I don't know, maybe frank just wants to get away from you. Who knows.",
        "Karen: You know, you're pathetic, kevin, you know that? With all that talent wrapped up in that head of yours, all you can do is hurt people.",
        "Elizabeth: Oh, ian. Thank god I found you. Wow. Listen, you've got to come, you've got to come right away.",
        "Ian: What?",
        "Elizabeth: It's lucy. There's something really wrong at lucy'S. You've got to come. Excuse us.",
        "Lucy: It was joshua, wasn't it? Joshua is the one who turned you.",
        "Frank: It doesn't matter who.",
        "Lucy: Yeah, it does. It does, frank, because it's not too late. You don't have to do this. You don't have to go over to the dark side. I can help you through this.",
        "Frank: Did I say I wanted help?",
        "Lucy: All right then, fine. What is it you do want from me?",
        "Frank: Not you.",
        "Alison: Lucy? I found you a sweater. Sorry t took me so long.",
        "Lucy: Alison.",
        "Alison: I couldn't find --",
        "lucy: Alison. No, no.",
        "Frank: Aha, just the girl I was looking for.",
        "Lucy: Alison, listen to me, you've got to get out of here! Run! Get out of here!",
        "Alison: Lucy --",
        "lucy: Ugh!",
        "Alison: What is --",
        "lucy: Alison, please just run! Alison, get out of here and run!",
        "Frank: You think you can stop me? You can't even stand up! Now move!",
        "Alison: Oh, my god! Lucy! Oh, my god, are you ok? Lucy, say something!",
        "Frank: Don't worry about lucy.",
        "Alison: Oh, my god, lucy! Why did you hit her like that? Why'd you throw her?",
        "Frank: I said leave her alone, alison!",

        "Livvie: Ok, I can feel it. I know something's down here. I have to look.",
        "Livvie: This door -- why is it so heavy?",
        "Man: Hey, what's going on? Is there anybody down there?",
        "Rafe: The pictures, joshua. Answer me.",
        "Joshua: What can I say, it's -- it's this hobby that I have.",
        "Rafe: I'd stay right there if I were you. Now, tell me, what are you doing with pictures of alison?",
        "Joshua: You know what, rafe? You surprise me. I'd have thought it would be obvious.",
        "Rafe: Yeah? What? What's so obvious?",
        "Joshua: What? Do I have to spell it out for you?",
        "Rafe: Yeah, why don't you go ahead and do that?",
        "Joshua: All right. All right, I'll tell you. You leave me no choice.",
        "Rafe: No, no, I don'T.",
        "Joshua: I was doing my -- my homework. Wasn't going to do battle with you, so I gathered all the evidence that I could on alison.",
        "Rafe: Wrong. Try again.",
        "Joshua: Oh, please.",
        "Rafe: If that were true, then you would have me under surveillance, too, and you didn'T. Just livvie and alison. So I'm going to ask you one more time, what were you doing with the pictures of alison?",
        "Joshua: If you're so smart, why don't you figure it out for yourself?",
        "Rafe: When I think about you with those pictures, my mind goes to a very bad place. You want alison all to yourself, don't you?",
        "Joshua: What's the matter? Don't you like a little competition?",
        "Rafe: I'm done with you. I don't care what your plan is. It's over now! Need proof that scoop away's new odor fighters",

        "Karen: You know what I want more than anything else? I want us to get away somewhere, somewhere where all we have to think about is each other, where we could talk about our future, make a clean start.",
        "Frank: It sounds like heaven.",
        "Frank's voice: This amazing woman lights up my life, makes me feel like a prince.",
