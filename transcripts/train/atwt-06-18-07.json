        "Emma: The bride is usually the last person to get to the church.",
        "Meg: I just wanted some time to -- think.",
        "Emma: Or pray?",
        "Meg: Maybe.",
        "Emma: I know I said I would stand by you no matter what.",
        "Meg: You changed your mind?",
        "Emma: Meg, I just have to say this -- it's not too late to get out of this.",
        "Paul: I'll give you a call when we're ten minutes away from the airport. 'Cause I want that leave as soon as we get there. [ Knock on the door ] I gotta go. I gotta go.",
        "Lily: Hello.",
        "Paul: Hi, lily.",
        "Lily: Hi.",
        "Paul: You look really nice.",
        "Lily: Thank you.",
        "Paul: All dressed up and no where to go?",
        "Lily: I was on my way to the wedding, and I thought I'd drop by. See how you were doing.",
        "Paul: Where's holden? Come on in.",
        "Lily: He's boycotting the whole thing.",
        "Paul: Is that so?",
        "Lily: He can barely talk to meg, and won't even look at craig.",
        "Paul: That's going to be awkward on the reception line. You want a drink?",
        "Lily: No, thank you.",
        "Paul: Okay. Don't mind if I do. Here's to the -- the happy couple.",
        "Lily: So the woman that you love is marrying someone else, and that doesn't bother you at all?",
        "Paul: Not a whole lot I can do about it.",
        "Lily: Holden seems more upset about this than you do. Which is -- that's crazy. You want to tell me what's really going on?",
        "Paul: What do you want me to say? Lily, after tonight -- this is the beginning of the end for craig montgomery.",
        "Margo: I hate men.",
        "Craig: Yeah, somehow, I've always known that.",
        "Margo: All you have to do is put on a tux, and even a schlub like you looks so great.",
        "Craig: Well, thank you. That was nice.",
        "Margo: You don't have to wear heels.",
        "Craig: All right. Please, margo. You know, the best person is supposed to be uplifting. So don't whine.",
        "Margo: All right. Well, then can I take this opportunity to ask one more time -- is this really what you want to do?",
        "Craig: I love meg.",
        "Margo: Yeah, but it's her loving you back thing that gives me pause.",
        "Craig: She does, in her way.",
        "Margo: In her way? Her way involves signing over a bunch of stock on her wedding day.",
        "Craig: It's fine. The stock doesn't mean anything to me.",
        "Tom: Really? To me, it looked like you went through a hell of a lot of trouble to get it.",
        "Craig: Those the papers?",
        "Tom: All set. Just sign, and meg snyder is the major stockholder of the company.",
        "Craig: Meg snyder-montgomery. Well, well, well. Look who's here to come wish me well.",
        "Lucinda: No, I just came to watch you sign the papers.",
        "Craig: I told you I would sign the papers. We all know, I'm a man of my word.",
        "Faith: So, you left the gun out? Not parker?",
        "J.J.: Parker did exactly what he was supposed to do. Okay, he put it back and he locked it up.",
        "Faith: So you moved it?",
        "J.J.: To get him in trouble.",
        "Faith: Well, it sure worked.",
        "J.J.: Well, I just wanted dad to see it and to get mad at parker so he broke the rules. Okay? And I didn't think that anyone would get hurt. Especially you.",
        "Faith: Even after it happened, you didn't say anything. You let parker take all the blame.",
        "[ J.J. Sighs ]",
        "J.J.: Faith, you don't know what he's been doing. Okay, he's horrible to mom, and makes everyone fight all the time so that --",
        "Faith: So that what?",
        "J.J.: So that we can never be a family again.",
        "Faith: Okay, J.J., I get it. I really do. But now they're going to send parker away for something that you did. You have to tell them the truth.",
        "J.J.: I can'T.",
        "Faith: You have to.",
        "J.J.: No, because then they'll send me away instead of him.",
        "Carly: Jack, I'm not dragging my feet on this just to make trouble. I know you want to do what's best for parker. So do I. I want to help.",
        "Jack: Then trust me.",
        "Carly: How about I trust us both? I know that we can help parker if we work together.",
        "Jack: Carly --",
        "Carly: I think it's wrong to hand him over to strangers who think they know what's best. He's never needed us more than he needs us now.",
        "Jack: There is no us! Can't you see that?",
        "Carly: Don't say that!",
        "Jack: No, I have to say that, 'cause that's the truth. We're beyond divorced. There's nothing left.",
        "Carly: We still share those children. Nothing will change that.",
        "Jack: Okay, carly, listen to me for a second. Parker needs to get a fresh start now, before he gets too many bad habits he can't break out of. Now, our son is in big, big trouble and that started long before you came back. It's been building for months and it's finally come to a head. He needs help.",
        "Carly: I know --",
        "Jack: And holding on to this delusion that we can somehow be a happy family again -- as nice as that sounds, it's never going to happen. So for parker's sake, you and I, we've got to face the truth --",
        "Katie: Jack, I was on my way to -- I'm sorry.",
        "Carly: So am I.",
        "Katie: I really didn't mean to interrupt. I just wanted to stop in and check in on you on my way to the wedding.",
        "Carly: A wedding? How fun.",
        "Jack: Carly --",
        "Carly: You be sure to tell that brother of yours not to have a second thought about rosanna.",
        "Jack: You look great. Have a great time.",
        "Katie: Thanks.",
        "Jack: Please tell meg that I wish I could make it, but I'm probably not going to be able to. I want to spend as much time with parker as I can before --",
        "Katie: Yeah, I figured. I'll tell her. She'll understand.",
        "Jack: Yeah.",
        "Katie: And, so I guess he's going to the camp.",
        "Jack: Yeah.",
        "Katie: I'm sorry, carly. I know that must be really hard.",
        "Carly: You know what makes it hard? Knowing in my heart that it's exactly the wrong thing to do.",
        "Craig: Do you think I've got something up my sleeve? Some little scheme?",
        "Lucinda: No, but I think that if you're not going through with it, then the blushing bride should know in advance. So she doesn't have to take the marital plunge.",
        "Craig: Tom, you got a pen? See? It's tom's pen. No disappearing ink.",
        "Tom: Well, they'll do what they always do.",
        "Margo: No force of nature can stop them.",
        "Craig: And voila! Signed, sealed and delivered. If you don't mind, I would like to deliver these to meg personally.",
        "Lucinda: Oh my god! [ Lucinda laughing ] You got another one of those ugly signs. Me!",
        "Craig: Yeah, some maniac destroyed the last one.",
        "Lucinda: Hey, darling. Don't you want to take it down? Take it with you? Maybe put it up in your den?",
        "Craig: Oh, I don't know. That's company property. That'll be up to -- to meg to decide.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, oh, I got it. You really want me to be worried and hurting.",
        "Craig: About what?",
        "Lucinda: You want me to quake in my boots.",
        "Craig: About what?",
        "Lucinda: About what? Meg might get ambition. She might want to take the company for herself and then lucinda's up the creek with no paddle.",
        "Craig: You know, I really don't know what meg's going to do. That's up to meg. But you know, if meg likes something, I don't know -- it might be something she would want to do.",
        "Lucinda: No. She doesn't go back on her word. She's not like you.",
        "Craig: There's always a first time.",
        "Lucinda: No. I know I can count on meg, always, to do the right thing.",
        "Craig: That's right. You can trust her. Everyone can trust her. That's one of the reasons why I love her so.",
        "Lily: Craig is all about revenge and control. And he's very patient. Look how long it took him to pay back my mother. And she did not publicly humiliate him.",
        "Paul: Neither has meg.",
        "Lily: Marrying him in a church in front of a town full of people and then walking away, paul --",
        "Paul: Is that what I said is going to happen?",
        "Lily: You just said it was the beginning of the end for craig montgomery.",
        "Paul: Yes, but I didn't -- I didn't say how.",
        "Lily: You didn't have to. Craig does not forgive. Or forget. You can't get far enough away from him.",
        "Paul: Look, he's not all powerful. I know you let your guard down.",
        "Lily: I let my guard down. He took advantage when I was unable to make decisions. Yes. This is all my fault, I know that.",
        "Paul: It's not your fault.",
        "Lily: Yes it is.",
        "Paul: Lily, no. It's not your fault. It's his fault. Don't you want to see craig pay for what he's done?",
        "Lily: Yes. But I'd rather see him get away with it than see meg pay for what's happened.",
        "Paul: I'll make sure that meg doesn't get hurt.",
        "Lily: Let me just say one more thing. Forget about craig. Just think about meg.",
        "Meg: I'm going to marry craig. And I will not change my mind.",
        "Emma: That's why you're sitting here -- praying that this marriage is the right thing to do.",
        "Meg: Don't you understand? I'm doing this for my family. And you're not helping. I'm sorry.",
        "Emma: No, no. Don't be. Don't be.",
        "Meg: Look, I know you don't understand. You would never do something like this.",
        "Emma: No. No. I wouldn't do this.",
        "Meg: I'll be fine. You need to trust me on this.",
        "Emma: Meg --",
        "Meg: What? What? What is it?",
        "Emma: Look, if you were to take craig on in the boardroom -- if paul took him on in a back alley -- I would cheer. But this is our church. Marriage is sacred! Meg, you are playing with fire.",
        "Faith: Come on, J.J. They're not going to send you away.",
        "J.J.: Why? If they can do it to parker, they can sure do it to me.",
        "Faith: But that's different. Parker's been causing trouble for months. You haven'T. You're usually the opposite. You never do anything wrong.",
        "J.J.: Yeah, that makes things worse. Listen, mom and dad, they trust me. And I'm the good kid. They don't have to worry about me all the time. If they find out what I did, they'll hate me.",
        "Faith: Look at all that parker's done. They don't hate him.",
        "J.J.: Are you going to tell on me?",
        "Faith: No.",
        "J.J.: Thank you.",
        "Faith: Because you're going to tell them yourself.",
        "J.J.: I don't think I can.",
        "Faith: I think you will when you realize what you're doing to your brother.",
        "Katie: I'm going to get going.",
        "Jack: No. You know what, hold on just a second. I know you don't agree about parker and that it's hard. But the decision's been made. And I really don't see any good coming from us going over and over it.",
        "Carly: You don't think it's worth talking about in private?",
        "Jack: No. Listen, parker needs some last minute things, do you -- do you have any time to run some errands before the wedding?",
        "Carly: I'll go.",
        "Katie: Sure.",
        "Jack: No, no. I thought maybe you and parker might like some time alone.",
        "Carly: Thank you.",
        "Jack: I won't be long.",
        "Carly: Checking in, helping with the errands, isn't she just adorable?",
        "Parker: Talking to yourself? I guess I'm not the only one who's crazy.",
        "Carly: Hey parker, you know i just went to the mat for you, trying to get jack to rethink this whole camp thing. So maybe you could drop the attitude for like five minutes?",
        "Parker: Am I supposed to be grateful?",
        "Carly: You're supposed to help me convince jack that you had nothing to do with what happened to faith. You're supposed to make some small contribution to your own defense.",
        "Parker: Why should I?",
        "Carly: Because you're being punished for something you didn't do!",
        "Parker: Don't, okay. I'm going to this camp. I don't have a choice. At least let me do it my way.",
        "Carly: Okay. All right, fair enough. Is there anything I can do to help you?",
        "Parker: Not talk about it.",
        "Carly: All righty. Are you hungry? Can I get you something to eat?",
        "Parker: No. I'm going to put my stuff in the truck, and I'm going to go see the animals before I leave.",
        "Carly: Right. You know, parker, it doesn't make any sense.",
        "[ Man ] New place...",
        "Jack: You sure you don't want to get going?",
        "Katie: No. I don't really feel any need to be early for craig's wedding. It's just a token appearance anyway. Mostly for margo.",
        "Jack: Yeah.",
        "Katie: I'm sorry. I know sending parker away is the last thing you wanted to do.",
        "Jack: No, I really think that this camp could help him. It's just -- carly seems so sure it's a bad idea. So sure.",
        "Katie: Well, she hasn't been around, jack. She doesn't know how many chances you've given him.",
        "Jack: She's got a special connection with parker though. When he was younger, it's like they had their own language.",
        "Katie: Maybe that's why he's been so angry. Because when carly left, he was more hurt than any of the kids. And he's been bending over backwards to pretend that he wasn'T.",
        "Jack: Yeah. Carly even knows that. She's got her eyes wide open when it comes to the kids. So why, why is it that when she looks at me with tears in her eyes and tells me that this it the wrong thing for parker to be going away from us right now --",
        "Katie: Don't you think that maybe part of it is that she's trying to get on his good side so that he'll forgive her?",
        "Jack: No, I don't think that's it at all. I think she really thinks this is a bad idea.",
        "Katie: And she makes sure that everyone, including parker, knows it.",
        "Jack: Huh?",
        "Katie: All right, I'm going to do what margo told me not to do. But -- I think carly has a lot of nerve. She knows how hard this decision has been for you. She's not backing you up, she's not supporting you. In fact, she's using the situation to make you look like the bad guy so that she'll -- I'm sorry. Forget I said anything. It's none of my business.",
        "Jack: Listen, katie. I don't have a lot of wonderful things to say about carly. But she loves those kids. And she really thinks this is the wrong move for parker right now.",
        "Katie: So, are you second guessing your decision?",
        "Jack: No. Yeah. I don't know. Something about it just -- it just doesn't feel right to me right now. I don't know, it's bothering me.",
        "Katie: Well, if you think she's right, and you need to work with her, I will understand.",
        "Jack: I don't even know what that means -- work with her. Listen to me, this is not about me and carly. It's about me and parker. I screwed it up.",
        "Katie: No, you didn'T.",
        "Jack: I really screwed it up. Yes, I did.",
        "Katie: Jack. You didn'T.",
        "Jack: Listen, he knows how to push my buttons. So I get angry and I get frustrated.",
        "Katie: Of course you do. You're human.",
        "Jack: Yeah, but I'm not beating myself up here. Not at all. The kid's been a nightmare. It's just that part of me is seeing -- something's off.",
        "Katie: What do you mean?",
        "Jack: Something's going on beneath everything. And I don't know what it is.",
        "J.J.: Are you going already?",
        "Parker: Yeah. Are you going to do your happy dance?",
        "J.J.: No. Parker --",
        "Parker: Don't touch my stuff while I'm gone.",
        "J.J.: I won'T.",
        "Parker: Hey, why don't you smile or something. You got what you wanted, right?",
        "J.J.: I never thought -- mom. I didn't know you were here.",
        "Carly: Why don't we go inside and have a snack? So, parker's pretty hard on you, huh? I can see why you're not too sorry to see him go.",
        "J.J.: I didn't say that.",
        "Carly: You know, I was just talking to jack, and I was telling him that maybe he ought to rethink sending parker to this camp. But now, I don't know. I think it might be a good idea.",
        "J.J.: What?",
        "Carly: Yeah. You know, things might be better around here with him gone.",
        "J.J.: No!",
        "Carly: You don't think so?",
        "J.J.: No.",
        "Carly: Well, you know, I guess it doesn't even matter what we think. 'Cause it's up to jack. And you know, the thing with jack? I don't think it's just that parker left the gun out. I think that it bothers him more that parker keeps lying about that. And you know, that really bothers me, too. One of the things that took me a very long time to learn is how bad it is to lie. Yeah. I lied a lot. About everything. Took me a while to figure out that the worst part about lying is what it did to me. How it made me feel. It made me feel -- bad. Real sick inside. You know what I mean. So, that's why I really feel sorry for parker. He must feel so bad inside, you know? It must be awful.",
        "J.J.: Mom --",
        "Carly: Hmm?",
        "J.J.: Can we please talk about something else?",
        "Carly: Yeah. Yeah, sure. If that's really what you want to do.",
        "Lucinda: Craig signed the papers, I was there. I saw it.",
        "Paul: You really think it was such a good idea for you to show up?",
        "Lucinda: Oh, darling. He would have been suspicious if I hadn'T. He's on top of the world. He's just flying high.",
        "Paul: Right. Now he doesn't suspect a thing?",
        "Lucinda: No, no, no. That's his fatal flaw. Don't you know that? Don't you know that? His achilles' heal -- he thinks he's smarter than everybody else.",
        "Paul: I thought meg was his fatal flaw.",
        "Lucinda: Oh, darling. That kind of makes you two brothers under the skin, doesn't it? Sorry, I don't mean to be flippant. I do feel your pain.",
        "Paul: I'll give you some aspirin. Might help you out a little bit.",
        "Lucinda: I've said nasty things to you over the years. I really have.",
        "Paul: Yes, and you meant every word.",
        "Lucinda: Ah, but you know, this time I really, I empathize because it must be so awful for you to think that meg is marrying that man. Even if it doesn't mean --",
        "Paul: I try not to think about it. And talking about it makes me think about it.",
        "Lucinda: Well after tonight, when you and meg are together -- I want you to know that I will never forget what she has done for me and my company. And anytime you or yours or meg or you, anyone needs anything from me, just ask me.",
        "Paul: Thanks. But there's really nothing left to do except enjoy craig's pain and humiliation.",
        "Lucinda: Ahh -- what a beautiful, beautiful thing to contemplate. And when you and meg are together, tonight, I'll have a bottle of champagne set aside and you can pop the cork and just drink to your wonderful, wonderful future together and the downfall of craig montgomery.",
        "Craig: You take my breath away.",
        "Meg: You scared me.",
        "Craig: Sorry.",
        "Meg: What are you doing here? It's too early.",
        "Craig: Well, I could ask you the same thing. I mean, aren't you supposed to show up late, keep me pacing on pins and needles, waiting for the last moment?",
        "Meg: Craig, I went along with a church ceremony, candles, flowers, everything you wanted --",
        "Craig: We wanted.",
        "Meg: Look, you don't seriously expect me to play blushing bride, do you?",
        "Craig: No sentiment? Not even on our wedding day?",
        "Meg: If you wanted sentiment, you made a wrong choice.",
        "Craig: No, no, no, no. No, I made the right choice. Do you know that you're not supposed to lie in places like this?",
        "Meg: I'm sure that doesn't apply to you.",
        "Craig: Well, it does tonight. Would you like some truth? I love you, meg. And I want you to be happy. Now you say something.",
        "Meg: I'm sorry. The truth is -- I'm a little nervous talking to you right now. You know, just before the wedding.",
        "Craig: What? Superstitious or something? You think that's bad luck?",
        "Meg: Maybe it's just finally hitting me. What we're actually doing here tonight.",
        "Craig: We're not doing anything wrong here tonight. You and I were meant for each other. 'Til death do us part.",
        "Meg: Oh, that's fun.",
        "Craig: No, that's part of the deal. Speaking of deals -- here it is. All signed, ready to go.",
        "Meg: The papers?",
        "Craig: Yes. You have yourself a new husband and you have yourself a new company.",
        "Meg: Craig, thank you.",
        "Craig: I think, though, I will hold onto these until after the wedding.",
        "Meg: Really?",
        "Craig: Yeah, you don't have any pockets. Where are you going to put this? Are you going to shove this down your bodice or something?",
        "Meg: Right.",
        "Craig: I think that they'll be fine right here. And later, when I'm taking my vows, I'll put my hand over my heart -- hear the crinkling of the paper, go like that. I say something wrong?",
        "Meg: It's not quite the conversation I was thinking of having just before I got married.",
        "Craig: Yeah, but that's us, meg. That's us. We're just blunt. We're just to the point. And there are no secrets.",
        "Announcer: This summer, don't miss \"inturn.\" It's a real life soap opera. Nine would-be actors are trained by the stars of \"as the world turns.\" But only one will win the part of a lifetime -- a 13 week contract on \"as the world turns.\" Go right now to cbs.Com.

        "Tom: Yes, I agree, that is critical. Hey, I'm sorry. Uh -- something's come up.",
        "Margo: Something critical?",
        "Tom: Yes. I've got to go.",
        "Margo: How much did you pay somebody to call you and tell you something critical happened right before the ceremony?",
        "Tom: How can you say something like that? You know it's killing me to leave this event. To watch craig marry someone as nice as meg, it's like -- watching a boa constrictor with a mouse.",
        "Margo: I'd be really mad at you for saying that if I didn't totally agree. Do you know anybody in there?",
        "Tom: No, I heard a couple of them over talking. It sounds like they're all from the board.",
        "Margo: They sound pretty bored to me.",
        "Tom: Apparently, craig's last decree at montgomery enterprises was that they all attend.",
        "Margo: That is so sweet, so keeping with the romantic nature of the event.",
        "Tom: Well, yeah, if you're going to buy a bride, you might as well rent the guests. Right? Look, I gotta go. Have a good time, give a nice toast and I'll see you at home.",
        "Margo: Okay. Don't expect me to be nice.",
        "Tom: Oh, I never do.",
        "Lucinda: Hi, honey. Oh, my heavens, there's no need to glower so. This is a wedding.",
        "Lily: This is not a wedding, this is a human sacrifice.",
        "Lucinda: It's not going to come to that.",
        "Lily: Oh, really?",
        "Lucinda: I saw him do it. He signed the papers. He signed the shares over to meg. I was there, I saw him do it.",
        "Lily: So, he's made a payment. In a few minutes, he'll take delivery of the goods.",
        "Lucinda: You are looking at this in the worst possible light, dear.",
        "Lily: Do you have any idea what you're asking meg to do?",
        "Lucinda: Honey, meg knows exactly what she's doing.",
        "Lily: You don't know that.",
        "Lucinda: Yes, I do. And anyway, she and paul have something up their collective sleeves. Craig won't even see it coming.",
        "Paul: I got rid of those rings.",
        "Craig: I know this isn't the wedding you imagined.",
        "Meg: The trappings aren't important to me.",
        "Craig: But I do want this to be perfect day for you. I do think you're going to love the rings.",
        "Emma: Meg? They're going to open the doors. I think you should come with me.",
        "Craig: Emma. Or should I call you mama from now on?",
        "Emma: I don't think so, big boy. Not now, nor ever.",
        "Craig: Well, I know where meg got her sense of humor from, huh?",
        "Meg: Well, I guess I'll see you in a few minutes.",
        "Craig: Meg. You don't want to see the rings?",
        "Meg: You know, you've already seen the dress. Let's leave something as a surprise.",
        "Craig: Whatever you say. Hey, meg.",
        "Meg: What?",
        "Craig: Just something. It'll just take a second.",
        "Meg: I'll just be a minute, mama, I promise. I'll be right there.",
        "Emma: Okay.",
        "Craig: I do love you. And I'm going to do everything in my power to make you happy. Do you believe me?",
        "Meg: Yes, I believe you.",
        "Craig: Then please tell me that it's possible, one day, that I can make you happy.",
        "Meg: You know what I think? I think I'm nervous about the ceremony. But tomorrow morning when I wake up, I think I'm going to be just as happy as you are now.",
        "Craig: She finally said something nice.",
        "Jack: This whole thing with faith and the gun -- I know I blew it. He came in and I was all over him.",
        "Katie: What were you supposed to do? Everybody was freaked out. Faith could have ended up in the hospital.",
        "Jack: Yeah, but there were all those adults there just staring at him, so, of course, he kept to his story. But he never backed down, even with carly. Katie, do you know how much he does not want to go to this camp? So, why? Why wouldn't he just tell carly what happened? I mean, if it meant that he didn't have to be deported.",
        "Katie: What? So you think he was telling the truth?",
        "Jack: No, I think he left the gun out there to defy me, of course.",
        "Katie: I'm not following.",
        "Jack: Maybe I pushed him too hard. Maybe he'd rather go to this camp than be a part of the family. Who knows. All right, come on. You gotta get going. I don't want you to be late for this wedding.",
        "Katie: I don't think craig's going to miss me.",
        "Jack: I just don't want to drag you into my drama.",
        "Katie: You're not dragging me into anything. I want to come by and say bye to parker before he leaves anyway. Unless, you think that would make carly upset.",
        "Jack: All right, listen to me. You're a part of my life now. Carly's just got to get used to that.",
        "Carly: We can talk about something else. But I think you want to talk about this.",
        "J.J.: Okay. I don't want parker to go.",
        "Carly: No?",
        "J.J.: Well, I don't want anyone to go, okay? I want -- I want him to stay and I want you to get back with dad.",
        "Carly: I know.",
        "J.J.: So, why does he have to screw up everything? He made it so everyone's mad all the time.",
        "Carly: And you don't like that. J.J., I understand. I really do. But I have to ask you something. Something very important. Is parker lying about what happened with that gun?",
        "J.J.: No. I am.",
        "Jack: Hey. I couldn't remember if we needed more sunscreen, so I just -- what's wrong?",
        "Carly: I think J.J. Would like to talk to you for a minute.",
        "Jack: Sure.",
        "Carly: Just the three of us.",
        "Katie: Oh, I'll go outside.",
        "Jack: No, wait. Wait just a minute.",
        "J.J.: No, dad. Just me, you and mom.",
        "Katie: It's fine. I'll wait out on the porch.",
        "Jack: Okay. What's going on? What is it? What is it?",
        "J.J.: I did it.",
        "Jack: You did what?",
        "J.J.: I moved the gun out there. I -- parker put it back and I moved it.",
        "Jack: Okay, are you covering for your brother 'cause you don't want him to go away?",
        "J.J.: No. I tried getting him in trouble. And it worked. But I didn't mean for faith to get shot.",
        "Jack: Right.",
        "J.J.: I'm sorry. I'm sorry.",
        "Jack: Uh -- it's all right. It's okay.",
        "J.J.: No, it's not okay. Okay, you were going to send parker away, but now you're going to send me?",
        "Jack: No, no. I'm not going to send you anywhere. You made a lot of bad choices and you lied to me, and someone did get hurt. I'm disappointed.",
        "J.J.: But you're not going to send him away? I mean --",
        "Jack: No, no. I'm not going to send him away. Does he know?",
        "J.J.: No.",
        "Jack: Great, then you can be the one to tell him. You can also tell him you're sorry. He's going to be mad, but you can also be the guy to tell him that he doesn't have to go.",
        "J.J.: All right. Thanks, dad.",
        "Carly: Parker's out in the barn. Why don't you go talk to him?",
        "J.J.: Yeah.",
        "Jack: Well, you were right -- all along.",
        "Katie: Is everything okay? What happened?",
        "Jack: Carly said that parker was telling the truth. She was right. Parker didn't leave the gun out there. J.J. Did. I owe you an apology.",

        "Jeweler: Sorry, but I sold them again.",
        "Paul: To who?",
        "Jeweler: That's confidential.",
        "Paul: You don't understand, somebody could get hurt.",
        "Jeweler: Sir, I'm closed for the day. You need to calm down.",
        "Paul: I'm not going to calm down. Please, you have to tell me who you sold those rings to!",

        "Craig: I'm not nervous, I just don't trust paul ryan.",
        "Margo: What do you think he's going to do?",
        "Craig: I don't know, maybe some last-minute histrionics, you know, bursting in here. But I think he would have done that by now, so let's hope it's all smooth sailing from here on in.",

        "Carly: You don't have to apologize to me, jack.",
        "Jack: Why not? You kept telling me that parker didn't do it and I didn't believe you or him. I can't imagine how hard it was for him to think that I didn't trust him.",
