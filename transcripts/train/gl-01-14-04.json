        "Eden makes a copy of Bill's key to the Lewis office so she and Tony can check out the claims of the mysterious person who insists Bill is dirty. Tony, questions Danny about Bill's qualities and Danny misinterprets, thinking Tony wants to take Bill's place on the campaign and he is disappointed when Tony sets him straight. Later, Tony expresses confidence that Danny is clean as a whistle, Danny receives a visitor to his office: Vinnie Salerno. Reva's at the museum when Shayne is pushed by Marina to work harder now that he can actually walk, and Shayne surprisingly hesitates, not wanting to push too hard, too soon. Sandy arrives and asks Marah about her relationship with Jeffrey, and she denies that there is one. Jeffrey arrives on the heels of that and Sandy observes their closeness figuring out Marah was lying. Sandy follows Jeffrey when he leaves and confronts him outside Company, putting Jeffrey on notice not to hurt Marah. Jeffrey surprises Sandy by telling him he cares for her but can never have her much like Sandy. Back at the museum, Reva's seen enough of Shayne's odd behavior during the day to call him on it by day's end: is he a quitter? Rick tells Michelle he's going to try to convince Ed to step back from his hospital duties, at least until whatever it is that's obviously eating at him passes. Michelle can't reveal what she knows but reluctantly endorses Rick's plan. It backfires when Ed reacts in anger, and demands to know if Rick intends to go over his head. Rick says he just might. It ends contentiously between the two men, neither comfortable with how fast things are spinning out of control."

        "Rick: Oh, that's all right. I got it, I got it.",
        "Michelle: Okay. Since when don't you accept help from your little sister? You got today's duty roster there. Who are you looking for? Are you... You're looking for Dad.",
        "Rick: Yeah, but... Michelle, I was hoping that you wouldn't be here today.",
        "Michelle: Rick, I can handle myself with Dad, okay?",
        "Rick: I'm... I'm going to talk to Dad today, Michelle, and this is the last place that we need to be.",
        "Michelle: What are you going to do?",
        "Rick: I'm asking Dad to leave the hospital.",
        "Ed: Now you shut your mouth!",
        "Michelle: No, I won't, because I want to know the truth, and I want to hear you say it!",
        "Ed: I didn't do anything.",
        "Michelle: Oh, Dad, say it...",
        "Ed: I did nothing!",
        "Michelle: Tell me...",
        "Ed: You are not talking about me. This is not me!",
        "_Michelle: Please, tell me, Dad! _",
        "Ed: I did nothing!",
        "Rick: She told me that you slapped her in the face and that she's worried about you.",
        "Ed: So just leave it be.",
        "Rick: Are you drinking?",
        "Frank: You know, I came by to get a cup of coffee, but it looks like you could really use one.",
        "Marina: You should have seen him. I mean, he was practically sprinting.",
        "Marah: He walked across the room, Mom. It was amazing. I mean, you should let Shayne tell you himself.",
        "Marina: Or better yet he can show you.",
        "Shayne: It was just a few steps. Really, it was no big deal.",
        "Marina: Yes, it was. Come on, you got to show your mom, Shayne.",
        "Reva: Your cheerleading team here has been telling me all about your morning.",
        "Shayne: All lies.",
        "Reva: Oh, I don't think so. And you know what? Seeing as I missed it the first time you walked, I intend to be in a front-row seat for it this time.",
        "Marina: Yeah, you heard the woman. Come on, you got to show her.",
        "Shayne: No, I'm tired. I... really, this is... I don't want to overdo it this time.",
        "Marina: Get your cute butt out of that chair and take a few steps for your mom.",
        "Shayne: I said I'm tired, okay? I don't have to perform on cue!",
        "Marina: Shayne...",
        "Shayne: I just... I just mean there's only so much I can do in one day, you know? (Sighs) And seriously, anyway, it's like watching paint dry, you know? I'm a million times faster on my wheels.",
        "Marina: Yeah, right now. I mean, pretty soon, though, you're going to be running circles around that wheelchair, you know? And you're going to run around the bases before long.",
        "Shayne: Right. You know what? I forgot something in my room.",
        "Marina: He's okay. I just... I pushed him a little bit hard this morning.",
        "Reva: All in good time. Just baby steps.",
        "Marina: Yeah.",
        "Reva: Baby steps.",
        "(Knock on door)",
        "Marah: I'll get it. Oh, hi. Shayne will be happy to see you. He's a little overwhelmed by female energy right now. He's in his room.",
        "Sandy: Well, Shayne isn't the only family member I came to check up on.",
        "Marah: As you can tell, I am perfectly fine.",
        "Sandy: We haven't spoken since New Year's Eve.",
        "Marah: Sorry.",
        "Sandy: I'm starting to think you're avoiding me.",
        "Marah: No, I've just... I've been busy, really.",
        "Sandy: Yeah, real busy. I saw you, Marah, coming out of Jeffrey O'Neill's room. You, uh, spent the night with him, didn't you?",
        "Eden: What?",
        "Tony: What do you mean, what? Did you do it? You didn't.",
        "Eden: No. I haven't had a chance to make the keys yet. Just give me a break, Tony, all right?",
        "Tony: Okay, Eden, you know what? Get on it, please. Make the copies; you get them to me and your job is done. You want me to help Bill, right?",
        "Eden: I don't think Bill needs your help.",
        "Tony: All right, well, you know what? There's only one way for us to find out for sure.",
        "Eden: I am going to prove to you that Bill's clean.",
        "Tony: Eden, Bill is not the only one on the line here now. If you don't do this, I'm telling you right now, I will. You understand?",
        "Eden: You know, maybe it is time for us to cut our losses and fill Bill and Danny in.",
        "Tony: Well, you know what? For all we know that's exactly what our mystery guy wants. We handle this ourselves.",
        "Eden: And you don't know that. We might be playing right into his hands.",
        "Tony: Oh, you know what? Just... you call me when you have it.",
        "Eden: Yeah, but I still don't...",
        "(Phone clicks)",
        "Tony: Hey.",
        "Danny: Hey, you. I didn't know you were stopping by.",
        "Tony: I have to make an appointment now?",
        "Danny: (Laughs) Yeah, right.",
        "Tony: So how's the campaign going? You know, after all those years of perfecting your scowl, having to give it all up for smiling, handshaking...",
        "Danny: No, I'm keeping the scowl in reserve just for you. It's... campaign's going great. I mean, I'm booked solid. I'm getting tired of the sound of my own voice.",
        "Tony: That's good. Campaign manager -- how's he working out?",
        "Danny: Bill? He's... great. He's doing a great job. We're working really well together. Why?",
        "Tony: You trust him, Danny?",
        "Eden: (Gasps) How long have you been standing there?",
        "Bill: Long enough. Long enough to know that I need you right here, right now.",
        "Frank: You okay? You look beat.",
        "Ed: No, it's just, you know, between the clinic and the hospital, it's...",
        "Frank: I can imagine. Marina's told me that you've been really great with Shayne. It's really tough, seeing a young kid go through something like that.",
        "Ed: Yeah.",
        "Frank: How's Michelle doing? I haven't seen her in ages. I mean, I really miss her.",
        "Ed: She's busy, like just about everybody else.",
        "Frank: Yeah, I can imagine, with Danny's campaign. That's... that's pretty exciting. It's got to be kind of weird for you, though. I mean, Danny versus Ross? I mean, that's... a race like that could split a whole town up. Look, Ed, I know Danny's come a long way, but I really wish he wasn't doing this, because in the long run, I don't think it'd be good for Springfield. And anyway, I guess I shouldn't be saying that to his father-in- law. I'm sorry.",
        "Ed: Oh, it's... I thought the same thing myself a couple of times. You know, I will take another cup of coffee, but if you don't mind, could I have it to go?",
        "Frank: Yeah, you got it, buddy.",
        "Michelle: Rick, you're really going to ask Dad to take a leave from the hospital?",
        "Rick: I mean, hopefully, I can help him come to the right decision, Michelle. I mean, I'm not suggesting anything permanent. Just for now, this is the best thing for everybody.",
        "Michelle: Because of what happened between Dad and me?",
        "Rick: Michelle, he's completely out of control. I mean, not only did he mess up Shayne's meds, but there was a drowning victim that got... wheeled into the ER and... and he completely and totally froze.",
        "Michelle: A drowning victim?",
        "Rick: This woman was in terrible shape. LOC, hypertensive. But you know Dad. I mean, Michelle, he's handled a million cases like this in the past without blinking. But this time, he just... it was... he just stood there and he was like...",
        "Michelle: It was like he saw a ghost.",
        "Rick: ...Staring right through this person. I have seen him go through so many things in the past, Michelle, but I have never seen him like this, ever.",
        "Michelle: I know, I know. He needs help.",
        "Rick: Yeah, he needs help. And we're going to do everything we can help him, Michelle. But if he wants to screw up his life, there's not a damn thing we can do to stop him. But I'll be damned if I'm going to stand here and watch him hurt somebody. It's not going to happen. I'm asking him to leave the hospital.",
        "Michelle: Okay, okay. Do what you have to do.",
        "Rick: You're not going to fight me on this? Boy, you're usually the first person to come to his defense. I'm just surprised, that's all.",
        "Michelle: Yeah, me, too, about a lot of things.",
        "Marah: Are you stalking me now, Sandy?",
        "Sandy: Get over yourself, Marah. I was picking up my equipment the morning after the New Year's Eve party. The storage room's on Jeffrey's floor, and lucky me, I caught your exit. Don't tell me you're working on another contract. It was a little too early for that.",
        "Marah: This is so ridiculous. How can you even ask me about this?",
        "Sandy: Family looks out for one another. >From where I'm sitting, you're in trouble.",
        "Marah: Sandy...",
        "Sandy: This guy's a creep. I'm not going to stand by and watch him...",
        "Marah: ...You are my brother, okay, not my keeper. I can take care of myself.",
        "Sandy: That's not what it looked like.",
        "Marah: Well, what it looked like and what it was are two completely different things, neither of which are your business.",
        "Sandy: I'm making it my business. Look, whatever happened, Marah, you can tell me. I mean, did he... get you drunk? Force himself on you?",
        "Marah: Okay, you know, you want details? I'll give you details. I'll tell you every last thing that happened.",
        "Sandy: I don't need you to draw me a picture. I think I can get it.",
        "Marah: Oh, I don't think so. Sandy, you see, I went over there with one thing on my mind. I wanted him. And he was unbelievable.",
        "Sandy: That's enough for me...",
        "Marah: No, you asked; now you have to listen. He was sweet and caring and gentle.",
        "Sandy: I'm out of here.",
        "Marah: He was a perfect gentleman. He let me down easy and he let me fall asleep in his arms.",
        "Sandy: So, you and he, you guys didn't...",
        "Marah: No, no, we didn't. But it was still one of the best nights of my life.",
        "Sandy: How's that?",
        "Marah: Because he was honest and respectful, which is more than I can say for some people.",
        "Sandy: Okay, maybe I deserved that one, but that doesn't mean that Jeffrey O'Neill's the guy for you.",
        "Marah: You know what?",
        "Sandy: He's a...",
        "Marah: Sandy? Don't ruin my memories of that night, okay?",
        "Sandy: Marah...",
        "Marah: Leave it alone. It's all I've got. Now, if you want to see Shayne, he's in his room along with Mom.",
        "Danny: Why wouldn't I trust Bill?",
        "Tony: Well, I mean for starters, he's not blood.",
        "Danny: Yeah. True. Okay, I trust him about as much I trust anyone who isn't family. But last time I checked, family wasn't available. Why? Has it changed? Are you looking to replace him?",
        "Tony: No, Danny, the only thing I know about politics is that I don't belong.",
        "Danny: You could learn. I did.",
        "Tony: I don't... no offense. Listen, I'm not no good at making posters, man.",
        "Danny: Well, a campaign manager does a lot more than make posters.",
        "Tony: That's exactly why I had to ask the question.",
        "Danny: Okay. Bill's great. He's doing a terrific job. In fact, when I win this election... when I win this election, I'm going to owe a large part of that to him. But if truth be told, if it really were up to me, I'd much rather you were watching my back, yeah.",
        "Tony: Oh, come on, that's one thing you do know. You know I've always got your back, all right?",
        "Danny: Right. A lot of things are different now. I do miss having you around. I do. There are things that I could only tell you, that only you could understand. Don't you have a ranch be taking care of, cowboy?",
        "Tony: Wait a second. Hold on. You're kicking me out?",
        "Danny: Or whatever it is you do?",
        "Tony: You're kicking me out? Something I said? Is that it?",
        "Danny: No. I got a meeting. That's all.",
        "Tony: All right. Suit yourself. That's fine. But you know what? Listen, Danny, maybe this is best, you know? Maybe I can do more for you on the outside than I can on the inside. Now, listen, just because I'm not by your side doesn't mean I don't watch your back. Night and day. Okay?",
        "Bill: You know the one thing sexier than seeing you in one of my shirts is seeing you out of it.",
        "Eden: Oh, and think about all the money I've wasted on lingerie. Didn't you say something about going to work?",
        "Bill: Yeah, well, you know what they say: All work and no play...",
        "Eden: Oh.",
        "(Laughter)",
        "Eden: Really?",
        "Cassie: So what is it, a Cooper family requirement that each one of you hold down at least two jobs? (Laughs)",
        "Harley: Ha, ha, ha. Good morning to you, too.",
        "Cassie: Good morning.",
        "Harley: What?",
        "Cassie: What do you mean, what? It's morning. A cup of coffee.",
        "Harley: Oh, I'm sorry. Did they run out in that fancy hotel that you own?",
        "Cassie: Wow, you're cranky. I like your dad's coffee better than mine. Is that a crime?",
        "Harley: No. And it's totally fine. You're going to have to help yourself, because Lynn's in the back and I got to go.",
        "Cassie: No, you can't go.",
        "Harley: No, I have to, remember? Cooper family -- I have to get to that second job.",
        "Cassie: You are going nowhere, my friend.",
        "Shayne: Whatever it is you're looking for, you're not going to find anything. What... I can't even find anything in this room myself. Help me...",
        "Marina: Score. Do not doubt the organizational skills of Marina Cooper.",
        "Marah: What is it?",
        "Marina: Inspiration. I know my pep talks are maybe getting a little tired, so I thought you could do some good from hearing it from someone objective, and the sports page does not lie. Okay. \"There's no doubt that we will be hearing great things from this young man Shayne Lewis, very great things indeed. He is going to surprise us all.\" You see? There it is, right there in black and white, after your first game last summer.",
        "Shayne: Yeah, and it was a long time ago. It was before my accident.",
        "Marah: Not that long ago.",
        "Marina: Yeah, I mean you have been through a lot, but you're still the same person now that you were then, you know? And it's only a matter of time.",
        "Jeffrey: Hello? Anybody here? Shayne?",
        "Marah: Oh, yeah... I'll go see who that is. Hi.",
        "Jeffrey: Hi. I was looking... looking for Shayne.",
        "Marah: Yeah, I got that. He's... he's in his room with Marina and my mother and Sandy.",
        "Jeffrey: Oh. Well, good news travels fast. I heard he's made some amazing progress.",
        "Marah: What's that?",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, well, it's something for him... something for Shayne.",
        "Marah: Wow, that's really sweet of you.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, it's just, you know, a couple of out-of-print baseball books, kind of a congratulations-for-getting-better type of gift, type of thing. But maybe it's... maybe it's too soon.",
        "Marah: For what?",
        "Jeffrey: For baseball.",
        "Marah: No. You know, I don't think so. We've been talking about it and you know, it's not good to give up on something you care about. You want to bring it to him? You're not coming?",
        "Jeffrey: No. Why don't... why don't you give it to him, okay? I've got to get going.",
        "Marah: You just got here. You don't want to give the present to Shayne?",
        "Jeffrey: Marah, Marah, Marah. I didn't know you were going to be here, okay? Your car's not out front, so...",
        "Marah: Well, it's in the shop. So you're just... you're going to leave? It's really that difficult for you to be around me?",
        "Jeffrey: Sometimes, yeah. I really didn't come over here to try to make things even more awkward between us. I just came by to give Shayne these books, so...",
        "Marah: Ah, and you've done that.",
        "Jeffrey: Yes, I have. So... I got to get going. Tell Shayne I'm happy for him.",
        "Marah: I miss you.",
        "Jeffrey: I miss you, too. But that's the way it's got to be.",
        "Marah: And why is that, again? I can't seem to remember.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, I have to remember for both of us, then. We'll always have that night. But that's all we can have.",
        "Marah: And I still don't get a say in that? So that's it? We just go our separate ways, no looking back? And you can do that? No looking back? All right. Well, I guess things aren't going to change, so... thank you for Shayne's present.",
        "Jeffrey: Marah...",
        "Marah: Shh.",
        "Cassie: Okay, see, now isn't this better than going to the stupid office?",
        "Harley: Well, you can tell that my client that's waiting.",
        "Cassie: Oh, is it a big case?",
        "Harley: No, not that big.",
        "Cassie: Good. Then you can take a little break. I never get to talk to you, you know. You and Blake, you guys are always so busy.",
        "Harley: Well, what about you and your best friend Olivia?",
        "Cassie: Wow, you're jealous. I like it.",
        "Harley: Shut up.",
        "Cassie: (Laughs)",
        "Harley: Talk. What?",
        "Cassie: Oh. I don't know.",
        "Harley: Okay, I'm listening.",
        "Cassie: All right. Gosh, I feel so loved by you.",
        "Harley: That's a good thing to talk about. How is Edmund?",
        "Cassie: He's great. He's wonderful.",
        "Harley: Well, okay.",
        "Cassie: Okay?",
        "Harley: I'm happy for you. You seem happy. And if you're happy, I'm happy for you.",
        "Cassie: Why does everyone keep saying that?",
        "Harley: What?",
        "Cassie: Why wouldn't I be happy? I mean, Edmund is incredibly wonderful. I mean, I know that's hard to believe, but...",
        "Harley: Well, maybe you're just the perfect woman to bring out his wonderfulness.",
        "Cassie: Maybe I am. I told him I loved him.",
        "Harley: Hopefully that's because you do.",
        "Cassie: How could I not? Edmund's incredible.",
        "Harley: And wonderful.",
        "Cassie: You know, he's gone through a lot for us to be together. He's worked really hard. I've made him work very hard, you know? I need to love him. I do. I'm not one of those people who can go into a relationship and be half. You know, it's all or nothing. I just... that's what I have to be. So...",
        "Harley: I know, I know. And I'm glad that you've moved on really, because I didn't think that you would after Richard.",
        "Cassie: Richard's gone, and he's not coming back.",
        "Harley: No, but...",
        "Cassie: I will never love anyone...",
        "Harley: Of course not -- the way that you would love him. But there are different kinds of love. There are.",
        "Cassie: And Edmund and I have found a different kind of love. And I don't care what anyone thinks; we belong together, so...",
        "Bill: Come on, come on. It's shower time.",
        "Eden: You know what will happen if I go in there.",
        "Bill: I don't. But I'm hoping that maybe...",
        "Eden: You will never leave this apartment.",
        "Bill: Well, I don't see the problem with that.",
        "Eden: Oh, you will not get your work done for Danny, and Danny will lose the election, and it will be because you took a shower with me. So, if you think about it, I'm saving the election.",
        "Bill: Well, look at you. Putting the election before everything else. Maybe you're the one who should be in politics, huh?",
        "Eden: I'm in too deep. It's you, not the election, that comes first. You know that, right?",
        "Bill: You okay?",
        "Eden: Yeah, I'm great. Now you go take that shower, okay?",
        "Bill: Yeah. You don't want to come in?",
        "Eden: Go.",
        "Rick: Dad?",
        "Ed: Oh, geez. Do not sneak up on people.",
        "Rick: Well, you're a hard person to find, Dad.",
        "Ed: Hey.",
        "Rick: What?",
        "Ed: I got something for you.",
        "Rick: Dad, I told you I didn't need this.",
        "Ed: I needed you to have that. That's my blood alcohol test, and it came back clean, so you can call off the intervention. I got to go.",
        "Rick: Whoa, whoa. Wait a minute.",
        "Ed: You have your proof.",
        "Rick: Michelle and...",
        "Ed: You have your proof. What else do you need from me?",
        "Rick: Michelle and I believed you when you said you weren't drinking, Dad. We knew that you weren't drinking. We don't need a piece of paper.",
        "Ed: Well, you have it anyway.",
        "Rick: I'm glad you're not drinking, Dad. But clearly something's wrong. Look, Dad, Dad, Dad. I'm not here to attack you. I'm just... I'm very concerned about you. I'm very, very worried about you, and so is Michelle.",
        "Ed: I know you're just trying to help. And what I need you to do is to stop trying.",
        "Rick: I can't stop caring. Look, look, you said to us that you were overtired. I mean, Michelle and I, we heard that, even if we heard it a little bit late, okay?",
        "Ed: I'm trying to get a lot more rest these days.",
        "Rick: That's not enough, Dad. It's not enough.",
        "Ed: What?",
        "Rick: Pick a vacation, Dad. You need a vacation. We got Hawaii, Great Britain, Ireland. You're long overdue.",
        "Ed: Rick...",
        "Rick: Dad, please. Take Holly. Take Holly. You know how long it's been since you've had yourself a good time?",
        "Ed: I know what you're trying to do. And, you know, you don't have to send me halfway around the world to do it. You're trying to get me out of the hospital, the sooner the better.",
        "Rick: You can't keep on going on like this. You can't.",
        "Ed: Like what?",
        "Rick: Like what? You're screwing up, Dad. You're screwing up big time.",
        "Ed: All right, look, what... what I did to Michelle, I will find a way...",
        "Rick: What you did to Michelle is not going to happen again. We both know that, right? What happens to Michelle, what happens to any member of this family, stays within this family. But what happens here in this hospital is a different story. If I hadn't stepped in when you were working on that woman, she would have died.",
        "Ed: And I thank you for that.",
        "Rick: You have a choice here, Dad, okay? You take a break, or you throw away everything that you've worked so hard for, permanently.",
        "Ed: Having me back home isn't all it's cracked up to be is it, Son?",
        "Rick: You have to resolve this thing, Dad, and get your confidence back. However you do that is up to you. But you're not going to do it here.",
        "Ed: Do you think that I would stay here if I thought that I were actually a risk to my patients?",
        "Rick: Well, sometimes when you're as close as you are to these things, you can't see it.",
        "Ed: But I do see this. I mean, I made a couple mistakes. No one got hurt. And it's not going to happen again.",
        "Rick: You can't guarantee that, can you, Dad?",
        "Ed: If I had to, I could walk out of here in two seconds, yes. I have a few things on my mind. Who the hell doesn't? But not enough to justify some kind of leave that would, I mean, let all these people around here, give them an excuse to doubt me.",
        "Rick: One fatality. One fatality in your condition and you're through as a doctor. You're through.",
        "Ed: Well, the answer is no.",
        "Rick: Don't make me do this the hard way, Dad. Don't.",
        "Ed: You'd go to the board?",
        "Rick: If I have to. Hey, Dad, you're the one who taught me everything about medicine. Patients come first, right? It doesn't have to be this way. It doesn't.",
        "Ed: No, it doesn't. See, I...",
        "Rick: What? What were you going to say?",
        "Ed: Just be careful, Rick. I don't forgive easily.",
        "Rick: You know what's funny, Dad? You don't sound anything like the man who taught me everything.",
        "Ed: You don't sound much like my son, either.",
        "Harley: Well, this has been great, really. But I do got to get...",
        "Cassie: I know. I'm sorry I've gone on and on and on.",
        "Harley: No, no, no, you didn't, really. No, really. You're my friend. I love you. And, of course, you know, I will listen if you need to talk. You would listen if I needed to talk.",
        "Cassie: I would. And do you? I mean, is everything okay?",
        "Harley: Everything is just fine. It really is. Work's good. The kids are good. Gus is good. Life could not be better.",
        "Cassie: I guess we both have everything we could ever want.",
        "Bill: Okay, well, don't wait up. I got to take care of some campaign business. Then I've got to do a little something with... over at Lewis. So, unfortunately, nighttime is the only time I have to catch up.",
        "Eden: Oh, and I thought that time was just for me.",
        "Bill: Oh. I'll make it up to you. I will.",
        "Eden: You don't have to make up for anything. But if you insist, you wake me.",
        "Bill: All right. Okay.",
        "Eden: And the award for Girlfriend of the Year... Did you forget...",
        "Tony: Well? Well? Eden, come on. Come on.",
        "Eden: You know, Bill could have seen you.",
        "Tony: I just did. Listen, did you get it? Come on.",
        "Eden: Yeah. And I haven't felt this low in a long time. So thanks, Tony.",
        "Tony: You think I want this? Do you?",
        "Eden: Yeah, I think that if Bill doesn't turn out clean, you'll be just fine.",
        "Tony: Well, you know what? That's where you're wrong, Eden. Bill is tied to Danny. If he goes down, so does Danny. If Bill comes out clean, maybe this whole thing amounts to absolutely nothing, all right? Or maybe it's our mystery man's idea of some damn prank, but we need to find out. You did exactly... exactly what had to be done, Eden. Look at me. That's what I like about you. In my book, that's the difference between you and Marah. You don't go around drawing imaginary lines between right and wrong. You did what you had to do.",
        "Eden: Yeah, and Marah knows the difference between right and wrong and I don't. And thanks for the compliment.",
        "Jeffrey: Hi, Sandy. How are you doing? I hear Shayne's doing a lot better.",
        "Sandy: Yeah, he's great. Your interest in my family is really, really touching.",
        "Jeffrey: You don't seem too happy about that.",
        "Sandy: Yeah, I think you care a little too much.",
        "Jeffrey: How's that?",
        "Sandy: Well, you're going all out to get to know my family. Showing up at the family dinners, the hospital, playing the Good Samaritan. While all the while, you're really just waiting to make your move.",
        "Jeffrey: My move?",
        "Sandy: Yeah, your move. Taking advantage of a girl half your age, sleeping with her when she's already having a bad time.",
        "Jeffrey: And how would you know about that?",
        "Sandy: Because I do. Not from Marah, though. She's covering for you. Mr. O'Neill, don't mess with my family.",
        "Jeffrey: Your family?",
        "Sandy: Yeah.",
        "Jeffrey: You're a big family man now, is that right?",
        "Sandy: Yeah! They need me to protect them from creeps like you.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay.",
        "Sandy: I'll simplify it for you...",
        "Jeffrey: Please.",
        "Sandy: ...Jeffrey.",
        "Jeffrey: Please do.",
        "Sandy: You hurt Marah, you answer to me.",
        "Jeffrey: So is that it? What, is that all you got, kid?",
        "Sandy: Yeah. I can back it up.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah. I understand this is a confusing time for, what with your new family and all the rest that's going on, and you probably need to lash out at something or someone. But I can assure you, you've chosen the wrong guy.",
        "Sandy: No, no, no. I've got the right guy.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, you want to play with the big boys?",
        "Sandy: Yes.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, maybe I should give you some advice first, okay?",
        "Sandy: You know what you can do with your advice?",
        "Jeffrey: Now, the advice is this. Listen up. Come here. The advice is you should go easy on the threats, okay? Because they don't really accomplish much of anything, okay, except for showing your opponent how vulnerable you are. You're going to do something? You should just do it, kid; you know that?",
        "Sandy: Okay.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay?",
        "Sandy: Mm-hmm.",
        "Jeffrey: Now, what did you accomplish just now, hmm? Besides giving me a little bit of information? You love Marah. It's killing you because you can't have her. And neither can I.",
        "Shayne: These are great. Why didn't he stick around so I could say thanks to him?",
        "Marah: You know, Jeffrey was probably busy. What... what happened to Sandy?",
        "Reva: He had something to do. He didn't say what.",
        "Marina: Actually, I've got to get out of here, too. I have a class.",
        "Marah: Yeah, I am going to get going, too. And maybe tomorrow or later we can go for a little stroll in the park.",
        "Shayne: Can I have a little breathing room, please? I'm not Superman.",
        "Marina: Oh, you are to me.",
        "Marah: Bye, Squirt.",
        "Marina: Bye.",
        "Shayne: Bye.",
        "Reva: Well, it looks like it's just you and me, kid. So what do you want to do? Let me kick your butt in one of those video games? Board game? Your choice. Maybe you want to try a little exercise?",
        "Shayne: It's nice, really nice of you, but I'm a little tired, so I'd rather just go to bed.",
        "Reva: Have I told you recently how incredibly proud I've been of you since the accident? Every day, watching you since you woke up, facing the world uphill; every day making your father and me so incredibly proud of you. I've never seen anyone face adversity with such determination and maturity. It made me feel in awe.",
        "Shayne: Mom, what's this about?",
        "Reva: I've been watching you today, and something's changed. And there's just one word that comes to mind: Quitter.",
        "Tony: It's not what I... Eden, you're twisting my words, okay?",
        "Eden: I don't think so. Your meaning was pretty clear. When there's a dirty job to do that requires no scruples and even less loyalty, I'm you're go-to girl, as opposed to Marah.",
        "Tony: I thought it was a compliment, Eden. You're a realist and I...",
        "Eden: Oh!",
        "Tony: Okay, okay.",
        "Eden: Just stay away.",
        "Tony: Okay, all right.",
        "Eden: I just slept with Bill here. He is who I'm with, okay? Got it?",
        "Tony: Fine. I got it. I'm making an observation. That's all, all right? I don't want to cause you any trouble. Eden, I don't.",
        "Eden: Yeah, like the trouble I caused you with Marah? You would have been riding off into the sunset with Marah if it wasn't for me sleeping with you.",
        "Tony: You're wrong. That's where you're wrong, Eden. Okay, Marah and I broke up for many other reasons. None of them had to do with... We... we broke up because I had to. Now can we please get back to work? Because with any luck, we'll prove that Bill is clean and that our mystery man is just playing games. So can we go back to work, please?",
        "Eden: Fine. But there is another possibility.",
        "Tony: Okay, yeah, what's that?",
        "Eden: Just because Bill is clean doesn't mean Danny is.",
        "Tony: No, Danny's clean. I'd stake my life on it.",
        "Salerno: Danny.",
        "Danny: Vinnie Salerno.",
        "Cassie: Next on Guiding Light...",
        "Billy: I figure I've failed you just about the worst way a brother can fail a brother.",
        "Reva: You can reboot your whole life. How many people would love to have the chance to do that?"
