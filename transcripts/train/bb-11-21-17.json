        "Bill thinks back over what he agreed to with Steffy that neither one would say what happened between them. Justin finds out from Bill that his plans have changed and he is not going on the Stella Maris after all. So just cancel the trip. Liam tells Steffy that she is such a wonderful woman and he feels so blessed since he was such a thoughtless fool. All he saw was his father's selfishness and she saw more. He wants her to know that he gets it now about family loyalty. He knows his dad would never betray him like he did him. He was confused and frustrated and he knows he and his father are going to butt heads again but he disrespected him and even Steffy so he wants to set things right with his dad. He needs to rebuild a relationship but he cannot do it alone. He needs her to come to Spencers with him; all the good that has happened is because of her. Justin tells Bill that this is not him, the bad guy, he has to make that stop. Bill tells him no, he does not want to be himself right now, not another word about it \u0096 the trip is off. Charlie and Pam arrive and Eric tells them he is sorry that Zende isn't here but it will be more than a full house. Eric tells Charlie that he is going to be very busy in the kitchen so he doesn't think he will need any extra security. Eric tells Rick and Maya that this year's holiday is going to be bigger and better than ever. And despite all their differences, this is the one day that they will all set aside those differences and make it a great holiday.",
        "Liam and Steffy join Bill and Liam admits that he has been wrong a lot. He spent all his time trying to right Bill's wrong and not on his own wrongs but this wise woman has shown him the error of his ways. He is not always right and he has to be big enough to admit he was wrong. He betrayed Bill and he is sorry for that and he hopes Bill can forgive him and allow him to come back to work with him. Quinn tells Eric that she texted Steffy earlier this morning but she has not responded yet. They both hope she doesn't have problems. Quinn says she is so proud to be his wife and be part of this tradition, an honor and to think she almost lost him this year. Bill stares at Liam and repeats \u0096 he wants Bill to forgive him. Liam says there are a lot of things in this world they are fighting for but nothing is more important than the bond between father and son and he believes that now. Bill gets up and walks toward Liam and says they have said this before. Liam says yes but Bill meant it and he needs to say this. He knows he almost demolished the Spectra building with him and Sally inside but he did not know that and he did not do that intentionally. They hug and vow their love for each other. Bill looks over his shoulder at Steffy."

        "Justin: Well, is it liam? The holidays?",
        "Bill: The holidays?",
        "Justin: Being apart from your son, I know it's taken a toll on you, bill. Being at odds with liam, the way he betrayed you.",
        "Bill: I wonder where he learned that from.",
        "Liam: It's like all I saw was my father's selfishness and greed, and you saw this whole other side to him that I didn't see, and you were right. I mean, I should have listened to you. So I promise you, every time you open your mouth from now on, I'm -- I'm all ears.",
        "Steffy: I -- I thought you wanted to move on and put this all behind us.",
        "Liam: I do, I do. I just -- I just want you to know that i get it now, the importance of family loyalty and just being able to trust each other. Obviously I don't approve of what my dad did, but the fact is... he would never betray me the way I betrayed him.",
        "Pam: So, we got to get the turkey in the oven first thing in the morning.",
        "Charlie: I know. We got to peel the potatoes, we got to chop the bread.",

        "Maya: Let's just hope all the surprises are on our plates, hmm?",
        "Rick: [ Scoffs ] I've seen the guest list. If you're looking for a laid-back, stress-free thanksgiving, you better make plans to eat someplace else.",
        "Eric: No. No, no, no, no. Thanksgiving is always a very magical time in this family. No matter what's going on in our lives, we always manage to rise above.",
        "Pam: I know, but... I hate to say this, eric. This year, I think it might take a miracle worker to bring everyone together.",
        "Bill: I condemned liam for not putting this family first.",
        "Justin: He was blackmailing you.",
        "Bill: And we got past it! Steffy asked me to make things right with liam, and I did that. I couldn't leave it alone. My gut says \"go,\" and it's full steam ahead. I built an empire with those instincts. I mean, they're not wrong, justin. I can't get other people to listen to them. I expect everybody to follow my rules, be loyal to me, loyal to the family. I confront liam about his betraying me, and what do I do? I hit him. I nearly killed him in that explosion.",
        "Bill: The things I've done... terrible things. For a father to do that to his own son... I don't deserve liam's respect. Or his love.",
        "Liam: It's true. Family should have been my priority.",
        "Steffy: So much conflict and emotion... anyone can lose their bearings.",
        "Liam: I was confused. And hurt and angry and frustrated.",
        "Steffy: Those are powerful feelings.",
        "Liam: Powerful enough i almost lost you.",
        "Steffy: No, you didn'T. We renewed our vows. You want a fresh start.",
        "Liam: I know. But I think I want that with my father, too. I do! [ Laughs ] I mean, I know we're gonna disagree and we're gonna butt heads, but... god, he's my dad, and he loves me, and I have to... I have to trust that. You know? And I have to take responsibility for my part in all of this.",
        "Steffy: No. No. No, you don'T. No, you don'T.",
        "Liam: No, I do -- I really do, steffy. I mea, I blackmailed him. I blackmailed my own dad, and i disrespected you, and I broke my marriage vows...",
        "Steffy: But then we made new vows. I thought we were gonna put that all behind us and focus on moving forward.",
        "Liam: I know, but that's -- that's what I'm trying to do. I'm trying to set things right with my dad. Look, he asked for my forgiveness. It's time that I asked for his. I need -- I need to rebuild his faith in me. But, steffy, I can't -- I can't do that alone. And I'd really like for you to come with me to spencer.",
        "Steffy: No, no, I don't think that's a good idea.",
        "Liam: Why not? Why not? Nobody was as invested in us reconciling as you, right?",
        "Steffy: I -- I know, and i still want that. I just think having me there might complicate things.",
        "Liam: Steffy, this is not just about my father and me. I mean, everything that happened, everything good that happened was because of you.",
        "Justin: I know what you need. A night out. I can't remember --",
        "Bill: That's not what I need.",
        "Justin: Listen, I know everybody's coming down on you, telling you what a bad guy you are, making you question yourself. But you got to stop that. That's not you! That's now what you do!",
        "Bill: No. No, it's not.",
        "Justin: That's right.",
        "Bill: I act.",
        "Justin: That's right.",
        "Bill: I see what I want, and I just -- I just take it.",
        "Justin: That's right! Look at sky, all right? She'll get you out of that mood. All that steel. Concrete. Mirrored glass. When that beauty is built, you will be able to see yourself every way you turn.",
        "Bill: No. No, I don't want to look at myself right now. Just do what I asked. Cancel the stella maris and the jet.",
        "Justin: No trip?",
        "Bill: No trip! And I don't want to hear another word about it!",
        "Pam: Where are we on the seating chart?",
        "Quinn: I left a few messages for steffy. She has not gotten back to me yet.",
        "Maya: Do we really need a seating chart?",
        "Rick: Yeah, we're all family.",
        "Pam: Are -- are you kidding? Other than the food, the seating chart is the most important part of thanksgiving.",
        "Quinn: Yeah, but I think she has a lot going on right now.",
        "Charlie: You know, eric, as head of forrester security, my powers of observation are legendary. So if you need me, I got your back. And your front, you know.",
        "Eric: Thank you, charlie. I think I'll be fine, really. And you're gonna be very, very busy in the kitchen.",
        "Quinn: Yeah, look, I'm sure I'll hear from steffy today. It probably just slipped her mind.",
        "[ Knocks on door ]",
        "Bill: What do I have to do to get some peace around -- liam. Steffy.",
        "Steffy: I, uh, told liam to talk to you himself, but he wants me here.",
        "Liam: I, um...I know I said I'd never come back here, that i was cutting all ties with spencer publications, that we were -- that we were done.",
        "Bill: And I believed you.",
        "Liam: I know you did. You both did. And, uh... I was wrong. I've been wrong a lot lately, and, uh...I'd like to come back. I'd like to work with you again. If you'll have me. I handled this poorly from the beginning. I blackmailed you. My own father. I forced you out of your company, I... I spent all my time focusing on righting your wrongs and never examining my own, and most of all, I didn't listen to this amazing, wise woman who did nothing but try to broker peace, who wouldn't let anything come between us.",
        "Steffy: That's the big thing. That's what we need to be focusing on.",
        "Liam: My values haven't changed. Obviously I have a different vision for this company. Obviously I won't agree with all of your tactics, but... I also know that I'm not always right, and I have to be big enough to admit when I'm wrong. Well... I'm wrong. I betrayed you, and I'm sorry. Would you forgive me?",
        "Quinn: We agreed.",
        "Eric: You won't even notice them.",
        "Quinn: Except for every 10 minutes, they come out of the kitchen wanting us to taste something.",
        "Eric: Well, maybe we should hide out. We'll hide out in the bedroom.",
        "Quinn: [ Gasps ] Oh, mr. Forrester, I love how you think.",
        "Eric: You were gonna try to call steffy again, though.",
        "Quinn: No, I texted her this morning. I'm sure she'll get back to me. You're really worried, aren't you?",
        "Eric: Well, I'm -- I'm wondering if maybe I should be. We find her bracelet in the guesthouse, and then it's not like her to be out of touch. It's like you said. Maybe something's going on in her life.",
        "Quinn: I don't want to think that she and liam are having problems.",
        "Eric: Yeah, neither do I. At any rate, we'll see them tomorrow. They'll be here, and we'll have a wonderful thanksgiving no matter what.",
        "Quinn: Aww, and just the way you like it -- a house full of family.",
        "Eric: I do love that",
        "Quinn: Mm-hmm.",
        "Eric: But I love my time alone with you.",
        "Quinn: Aww. I know. I feel exactly the same way. [ Sighs ] Especially after this year. I almost lost you. The love of my life. I am so proud to be your wife. To be a part of this...this family tradition and this house with my portrait hanging above the fireplace. I know what it means. You know, it's a honor to be mrs. Eric forrester. And I'm so thankful to you and everything you have brought into my life.",
        "Bill: You want me to forgive you?",
        "Liam: And I -- I understand if you want to think about it, given the way I've behaved.",
        "Steffy: No one's been blameless in this. We've all made mistakes.",
        "Liam: Well, it's time for me to admit mine. Look, there are a lot of causes in this world worth fighting for, but there's nothing more sacred, nothing more... foundational than loyalty. And I'm not -- I'm not just talking about the commitment between a husband and wife. I'm talking about the bond between father and son, and i want you to know I'm ready to make that a priority.",
        "Bill: Why now? We've both said this before.",
        "Liam: Yeah, but the difference is, you meant it. And despite the impressive shiner you left on my face, you've been nothing but loyal and faithful to me, and I think it's time I returned that faith and loyalty.",
        "Bill: Liam...",
        "Liam: No, listen. I got to get this out, okay? I know that you didn't mean to demolish the spectra building with me and sally inside. I know that. And, yeah, it happened, and, yeah, I almost died, but i also know that you saved my life. And I'm sorry. I'm sorry for the way that i treated you afterwards. And I -- I guess what I'm trying to say is... I love you, dad.",
        "Bill: I love you, too, son."
