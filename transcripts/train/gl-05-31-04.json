        "Danny: Michelle? Michelle? Can you hear me? Hi, honey. Hi. Hey, hi, can you see me? Michelle? Michelle?",
        "Tony: Hey. Hey.",
        "Michelle: You were there? You... ...saved....",
        "Danny: Michelle, baby. Honey? Michelle? Michelle? Hey, Michelle, can you hear me? Stay with her. Nurse!",
        "Tony: Michelle?",
        "Danny: Nurse!",
        "Bill: You....",
        "Eden: Bill.",
        "Bill: You... you're alive? You... you're alive! What? Tell me....",
        "Gus: Bill, bill.",
        "Bill: What?",
        "Gus: This should never have happened. Forget you saw her. She's walking out of the door right now. She's leaving town tonight and she's never coming back.",
        "Bill: What is going on? Is this a sick joke?",
        "Jeffrey: Bill, listen to me. Vinnie Salerno put out a hit on Eden. Eden had to appear to be dead so she could enter a witness protection.",
        "Harley: Salerno thinks she's dead and it has to stay that way, bill.",
        "Gus: Or she will be dead.",
        "Bill: She is dead. I just came from her funeral, the one you helped me plan.",
        "Gus: I had to do that. I'm sorry. It had to be that way.",
        "Bill: It was the almighty Jeffrey O'Neil who took her away from me.",
        "Harley: Nobody did this to hurt you. This was the only way to keep her alive. Can you understand that?",
        "Gus: There is a car waiting outside to take her to a private plane. Once she gets on the plane and travels through the first time zone, she has to start a new life.",
        "Harley: And it has to be this way, bill.",
        "Bill: No. No. It does not have to be this way. She's not the one that needs to be punished, it's Salerno. She did nothing wrong.",
        "Jeffrey: Actually, she did do something wrong, bill. She was helping Vinnie Salerno smuggle drugs into the country. She compromised a federal investigation by flushing everything down the toilet.",
        "Harley: Salerno has got to think she's dead or he will come after her.",
        "Gus: Listen to me, listen to me. Listen, listen. You have to do this, okay? I know it's not easy.",
        "Bill: No, I don't....",
        "Gus: I'm her brother. You have to do this to protect her.",
        "Bill: No, I don't, Gus. Eden, I thought I'd lost you. I thought I'd lost you, and you're alive. Call it divine intervention, call it what you will, but we have a second chance here. And there is no way I am not taking it.",
        "Danny: Rick, I'm telling you, she woke up, she spoke.",
        "Rick: So you said, Danny.",
        "Danny: I'm not making this up. I mean, she can't possibly have gone back into a coma again. She's just unconscious or something, right?",
        "Rick: No, she's comatose.",
        "Danny: That's impossible, Rick. How can she come out of it and then...? It doesn't make sense.",
        "Rick: It's not uncommon. Her going into a coma is her body's way of healing itself.",
        "Danny: So the chances are good if she came out of it, she's going to come out of it again, right?",
        "Rick: It depends.",
        "Danny: Give me something I can go on.",
        "Rick: I'm frustrated too, all right? All we can do is keep doing what we're doing, sitting with her and talking with her, and just praying she comes out of it.",
        "Danny: I know. I know you're frustrated. I'm sorry.",
        "Rick: I've got to get back to work. Bye, sweetie. I love you.",
        "Tony: Thanks, Rick.",
        "Danny: She's got to come out of this. Soon. Soon, honey, you hear me? Because I am not a patient guy. This is killing me.",
        "Salerno: Daniel, how's the wife?",
        "Danny: Hey, Vinnie. Thanks for coming. It means a lot.",
        "Salerno: Of course. Of course I came. You're part of my family now, both of you. And Michelle, of course, too. How's she doing?",
        "Danny: The same.",
        "Salerno: No change at all?",
        "Danny: No.",
        "Salerno: Talk about being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Did you ever figure out what she was doing at the warehouse that night?",
        "Danny: She was looking for Eden. She was helping Eden with her wedding, and she wanted to go over some stuff with her.",
        "Salerno: Really? Are you sure that was the reason?",
        "Danny: Yeah, why?",
        "Salerno: I'm just saying that maybe she... she went there because she was looking for you.",
        "Danny: Michelle didn't have any idea that I was there.",
        "Salerno: You don't know that. Maybe she followed you there.",
        "Danny: Why would she do that?",
        "Salerno: Well, to see what you're up to, right? She's the curious type, doesn't take no for an answer, got a mind of her own.",
        "Danny: I don't know. Yeah, I guess, sometimes, but....",
        "Salerno: Look, I'm just saying if that's the reason that she was at the warehouse that night, she might have seen what you did to our friend.",
        "Danny: Vinnie, that's a lot of speculation, don't you think?",
        "Salerno: Yeah, well, you know, thinking ahead, covering all the bases, that's what got me where I am today. If she did follow you....",
        "Danny: But she didn't, that's what I'm telling you. She didn't.",
        "Salerno: Listen to me. If she did and she saw what went down, then she's a witness to a murder. A witness to a murder you committed on my behalf. That's a problem, Danny. That's a big problem. Coming up on \"guiding Light\"...",
        "Cassie: You won't mind.",
        "Edmund: Cassie...",
        "Gus: I don't have a sister. My sister died.",
        "Bill: Look at me. You don't think that I know what you're trying to do here? You're trying to make up all this stuff so I'll think the worst of you. Let me tell you something, it's not going to happen, Eden. We haven't known each other all that long, but we've been through so much together, okay? We have grown together. We were going to get married and start a life together. Now, why do you want to walk away? Why do you want to walk away and leave that behind, huh? Tell me. Am I supposed to be forever grateful that you care about me so much that you would make this kind of sacrifice for me? Well, I got news for you, darling, I got news for you: I don't want a sacrifice; I want what we had, okay? And I cannot believe for one second that you don't want that either. I mean, what... you think I'm afraid of someone like Vinnie Salerno? Let me tell you, I would fight the devil himself if I thought that's what I had to do to keep you because that's how much you mean to me, okay? That's how much I care about you. Obviously I don't mean that much to you, because if I did, if I did, Eden, you wouldn't just walk out that door and never see me again. You would stay here and we would fight this thing together. Do you hear me? We would fight this thing together. But now it's too late, isn't it? It's too late. You're already walking away. And you're right, you're right, Eden, you're not the girl that I knew. No, you're not. Because she was brave. And you, you are scared. You are scared to see yourself like the way I once you saw. Saw you. Maybe you... maybe you, sweetheart, are a little too selfish. But either way, no. No. It's not worth it. You're not worth it. I'm not going to believe in someone who can't even believe in herself.",
        "Eden: Bill!",
        "Tony: You want to tell me what that was, Danny? Do you realize what he's going to do when he finds out you lied to him, huh?",
        "Danny: Tony, you don't know the half of it.",
        "Tony: What does that mean?",
        "Danny: You want to talk about lies? That was nothing. I've been lying to everybody, Tony. To you, to... well, everybody ever since...",
        "Tony: Hold on. Lying since when? About what?",
        "Danny: Tony, I'm working undercover for the federal government, for Jeffrey O'Neill. And my assignment is to bring Vinnie down.",
        "Tony: Danny, tell me you didn't say what I just heard you say. Vinnie put the hit on Eden; you followed through with it.",
        "Danny: The explosion was staged. The body in the morgue was Jane Doe. The EMT's were Feds. Eden's alive. O'Neill put her in witness protection.",
        "Tony: Oh, jeez....",
        "Danny: Listen to me. The night of the election O'Neill came to me. He knew that the seed money I was using was dirty. He was either going to take me down or I had to work for him.",
        "Tony: So he blackmailed you?",
        "Danny: Yeah. Tony, if it was just me I would have taken the heat. But O'Neill threatened to prosecute Cassie Winslow...",
        "Tony: Cassie?",
        "Danny: Right.",
        "Tony: How, why?",
        "Danny: She co-signed the federal loan with me. And he threatened to prosecute you. He threatened to prosecute bill lewis.",
        "Tony: But they didn't know, Danny.",
        "Danny: It didn't matter.",
        "Tony: O'Neill was the first one to tell us about...",
        "Danny: He wanted me to stay in the mayor's race to get elected. That way he could make it look like I rigged the election and destroy me.",
        "Tony: So you didn't rig it, is that what you're telling me?",
        "Danny: Right. Tony, he got me. He got me good, and I screwed up. When I got out, I didn't stay entirely clean. I got greedy, and this is how I'm paying for it.",
        "Tony: Do you realize I'm going to have to pay for this too?",
        "Danny: No. Because you're working with Salerno? No. I had O'Neill give you part immunity. That was part of the deal. You're safe.",
        "Tony: So you just decide to go solo. What about Michelle? She stayed with you?",
        "Danny: Michelle knows.",
        "Tony: She knows?",
        "Danny: She knows.",
        "Tony: Oh, boy.",
        "Danny: O'Neill didn't want me to tell her. He thought the more she knew the more danger she'd be in, but I didn't think that was the case. Plus, we agreed that we would never keep secrets from each other anymore. I wasn't going to keep her out of this.",
        "Tony: What'd she say?",
        "Danny: I was hoping that she would take Robbie and leave me so they'd be safe, but she didn't. She didn't. She stuck by me. Now look at her.",
        "Tony: Danny, this is...",
        "Danny: Vinnie was right. Michelle did follow me to the warehouse because I lied to her.",
        "Tony: Okay. About what?",
        "Danny: I didn't tell her about the fake hit on Eden. She knew something was up, and so she followed me to the warehouse.",
        "Tony: This is nuts.",
        "Danny: Now that Vinnie is sniffing around, I have got to keep Michelle safe. Will you?",
        "Jeffrey: Eden's gone, Bill. And now I need to know your intentions.",
        "Bill: Did you follow me here? Ladies and gentlemen, the grim reaper, Mr. Jeffrey O'Neill! Please don't stand up! My intentions? You've got some nerve. Am I going to run around and tell everyone that Eden's alive, ruin your little sting operation, get her killed in the process? Is that what you...? Ridiculous.",
        "Jeffrey: Well?",
        "Bill: She's dead, Mr. O'Neill.",
        "Jeffrey: You didn't answer the question.",
        "Bill: You're not listening. I said she's dead. She's dead to me.",
        "Jeffrey: Good. I hope it stays that way, because many years of hard work and a lot of lives now depend on that. And you've got too much of that whiskey in you to start saying the wrong thing to the wrong person. I just want to make sure we're clear on this.",
        "Bill: We're clear. She's dead and gone. May Eden rest in peace. At least one of us will.",
        "Cassie: Jeremy, have you seen Mr. Winslow?",
        "Jeremy: I think he's still outside on the phone.",
        "Cassie: Thanks.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Danny: My future is in your hands, like it or not. I need to know what to expect.",
        "Gus: What are you wondering?",
        "Harley: I'm wondering how you're going to handle it if you find out that Salerno's people on the Spaulding side are the Spaulding's"
