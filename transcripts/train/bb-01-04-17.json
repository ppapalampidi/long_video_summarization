        "Liam tells Ridge that he keeps saying he is working on it but just what does that mean? He better not get sucked in by Quinn. Quinn is surprised to find Ivy in her bedroom. Ivy says she knows .she saw her and Ridge in the steam room. Surely she is not cheating on Eric. Steffy tells Eric that not only is she hurting Wyatt but she is hurting Liam too. Eric tells her to go home and work on her marriage. He is married to Quinn and is happy and she is not going anywhere. She tells Eric that she wants to make it clear .she is just moving out on Liam temporarily but she is still with him. Eric asks what will happen if Hope comes back. Steffy won't hear that, he is committed to her. Eric opines again that he no longer can trust Ridge and that will never change. Liam tells Ridge that Quinn has black magic. Ridge says if none of this works and he goes down he is taking Quinn with him. Quinn tries to explain what was happening with Ridge and about the steam room and the outdoor shower. And she declares she is not cheating on Eric. Eric calls upstairs and tells Quinn to put on a special gown he has left and come downstairs, he has a surprise. Quinn tells Ivy something is going on and she cannot explain it but please give it a rest. She and Ridge are just messing with each other's heads. Ivy tells her to be careful as it sounds dangerous. Quinn says these silly little games are over with Ridge pretending to be interested in her. She is not going to let him destroy her marriage.",
        "Eric tells Steffy that this house is going to be festive again and now he is going to toast this woman that he trusts. She will never let him down. Then he asks her a favor. He wants her to move in here with him and Quinn and Wyatt. He wants her to have the same thing he has with Quinn and that will be with Wyatt. He is the one with a committed heart even if her tattoo is fading ..it is still there. Quinn tells Ivy that she is not going to let Ridge destroy her relationship with Eric. She is not stupid. She would never let Ridge get to her that way. Liam laments to Ridge that what he is saying makes no sense. Ridge says he is not going to cross the line but Quinn will. He can tell by the way she looks at him and lets him touch her. Quinn comes down the stairs and Eric comments how beautiful she looks and he has never been this in love in his life. Liam tells Ridge he never wants to see Quinn's face again so nothing will make him happier than her gone but Ridge is assuming she will get caught just for getting caught with her husband's son. That is playing a dangerous game. Everything good in Quinn's life is because of Eric so she is not going to risk that. Quinn and Eric sip their champagne and eat their gourmet catered dinner ..and a little flirtation every now and then is fun. He says he admires her so much and trusts her. She does not take that for granted. She tells him that he has changed her life and Wyatt's, he has been so good to them. They have had to stand up to a lot of people to be together. She does not ever want to do anything to let him down. They dance and she coos that he is the best thing that has ever happened to her in her whole life and she does not want to lose him. Ridge tells Liam that sometimes love hurts ..and Quinn's days with Eric are all but over."

        "Liam: Quinn is the reason Steffy moved out. Obviously I want her gone as much as you do.",
        "Ridge: I'm working on it.",
        "Liam: Okay, see, you keep saying that, but what specifically are you planning on doing?",
        "Ridge: Let me as you something. Have you ever really looked in Quinn's eyes? No, I know that, but -- there's an intensity there, huh? It's piercing. And I could see why my dad would be intoxicated by...",
        "Liam: Hey. Hey. Hey. Careful. Don't get sucked in.",
        "Quinn: I don't even know what kind of game you're playing here.",
        "Ridge: Games? You want to talk about games -- the girl that was standing there naked, taking a shower outside, teasing me? You could have grabbed a towel, and you didn't.",
        "Quinn: Oh! Hey! Ivy, what are you doing in my bedroom?",
        "Ivy: Quinn, I know.",
        "Quinn: You know what?",
        "Ivy: I saw you outside the steam room with Ridge. I heard what you were saying.",
        "Quinn: Oh, Ivy, you -- you're mistaken.",
        "Ivy: What exactly are you doing, Quinn? Are you cheating on Eric?",
        "Eric: I'm glad you moved out.",
        "Steffy: I didn't want to. I keep thinking it's a big mistake.",
        "Eric: I think it's the right thing to do.",
        "Steffy: Well, I don't. I let Liam down. You know, I keep going back on my promises. It's not fair to him.",
        "Eric: What about the promises you made to Wyatt, your husband?",
        "Steffy: I know Wyatt's hurt, but Liam's upset, too. He doesn't want me working with Wyatt or having such a strong presence on social media, and he definitely doesn't want me near Quinn.",
        "Eric: Well, he just wants what he wants, doesn't he?",
        "Steffy: Can you just see where he's coming from for one second?",
        "Eric: Steffy... I'm married to Quinn. Quinn's helping you run the company. She's not going anywhere. Wyatt's not going anywhere, either. And he's made you one of the top influencers in the world. Stick it out with him. Work on your marriage.",
        "Eric: Steffy, Liam wants you to stay at home, he wants you to sit by the fire and play it safe. You're better than that.",
        "Steffy: No, Liam -- Liam supports my career. He's just concerned about the people who I'm surrounding myself with. And I just -- I want to be clear. I moved out, but that's just temporary. I'm still with Liam. We're not broken up.",
        "Eric: What if hope comes back? What then?",
        "Steffy: Uh, he's committed to me.",
        "Eric: Yeah, well, for now, but it's no sure thing, is it? Steffy, I think he's holding you back.",
        "Steffy: Well, I disagree.",
        "Eric: You're a Forrester. I -- I have -- I have in mind that I'm gonna hand this whole company over to you one day.",
        "Steffy: What about my father?",
        "Eric: No. No, not Ridge. He's let me down time after time, and not just recently, either. When I was married to Brooke, we were happily married. We have two -- two beautiful children, and he reached in there and he took that away from me. A man doesn't forget that. No. My trust in Ridge is gone, and it's never coming back.",
        "Liam: I swear to God, Ridge, if you end up falling for Quinn, too...",
        "Ridge: What? No, I'm trying to figure out why my dad fell for her and why he gave her the keys to the kingdom three months in.",
        "Liam: Not even God could explain that.",
        "Ridge: [Sighs] There's something about her, man. Black magic, maybe.",
        "Liam: Yeah, black magic that she's using on your father and your daughter.",
        "Ridge: That's why I want to get her away from the family, keep them safe.",
        "Liam: Even if Eric never forgives you?",
        "Ridge: I'm doing it for him, as well. If I go down, I'm not going down by myself. I'm taking Quinn with me.",
        "Quinn: It's not what you think.",
        "Ivy: Quinn, are you having an affair?",
        "Quinn: Of course not!",
        "Ivy: [Stammers] So then why did I hear Ridge say that?",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] First of all, Ridge is engaged to Brooke.",
        "Ivy: I know that, so why did I hear him say that he saw you naked? Quinn, tell me I didn't hear that. Oh, my God, is it true?",
        "Quinn: Look, I was taking a shower in the outdoor shower I built for Eric, and there he was.",
        "Ivy: Right, so, when you saw him, you told him to leave, right? You got covered up? You got dressed?",
        "Quinn: Not exactly. Look, he's -- he's a control freak, I'm a control freak. I-I didn't shy away.",
        "Ivy: Quinn!",
        "Quinn: Look, that's all it was. I swear to you, I have never been unfaithful to my husband. And you can't tell anyone this. Especially not Eric. dad to change his mind..",
        "Liam: [Sighs] I mean, how far have you thought this through, really?",
        "Ridge: I'm out of options.",
        "Liam: Well, maybe not. Maybe there's a better way. I don't know.",
        "Ridge: Yeah? There's a better way? What is it, huh? What's your idea?",
        "Liam: I --",
        "Ridge: What's your idea, because I'm -- I'm tired of sitting around, waiting for my dad to change his mind. It's not gonna happen anytime soon. He thinks this woman is an angel, so we got to stop her!",
        "Liam: I agree with that, I know, but if Eric doesn't trust you now, what do you think's gonna happen?",
        "Ridge: He's been resenting me for years. I took Brooke away from him, so maybe this is payback.",
        "Liam: Ridge, you -- you devoted your life to this place. I mean, if this plan backfires, it's not just Eric. You lose Forrester.",
        "Ridge: Well, then I'll -- I'll go and get another job. I'll start my own company. You know what the worst thing is? The way my father looks at me.",
        "Liam: Yeah, he's not my biggest fan, either. I mean, Steffy and I -- we've been deprived so many times, and here I am, again, fighting for my relationship.",
        "Ridge: She'll make up her own mind.",
        "Liam: She did -- she did make up her mind. We were living together. We were starting a life together. Now she's living at Thomas'? It's ridiculous. And Quinn is the puppet master. But Eric... him, I didn't expect him to stoop so low. I mean, I don't think of Eric as a manipulative man, and yet, here he is, using his power to push Steffy back towards Wyatt.",
        "Eric: Wow, these are beautiful, thank you. You can start setting up, all right? We're gonna eat very soon. Thank you.",
        "Steffy: Flowers? Caterers? What's the occasion?",
        "Eric: An intimate evening with my wife. It's a surprise.",
        "Steffy: Oh!",
        "Eric: Darling?",
        "Quinn: Yes, sweetheart?",
        "Eric: There's a Forrester original in the closet for you. Would you put that on and come downstairs? I have a surprise for you.",
        "Quinn: [Laughs] Oh, lucky me. I can't wait.",
        "Eric: I'll see you soon.",
        "Steffy: Such a romantic.",
        "Eric: Got to keep things interesting, you know?",
        "Steffy: I imagine it never gets boring with Quinn.",
        "Eric: She's an incredible woman. I'm lucky to have her.",
        "Steffy: You're really committed to her.",
        "Eric: Yeah. I am. And she's committed to me.",
        "Quinn: Oh! It's breathtaking.",
        "Ivy: Uncle Eric designed it just for you.",
        "Quinn: Apparently so. He says he has a surprise, and he wants me to put it on and meet him downstairs.",
        "Ivy: [Scoffs] Quinn, he loves you. He's completely devoted to you.",
        "Quinn: And I'm devoted to him.",
        "Ivy: Okay, well, stop flirting with Ridge.",
        "Quinn: [Stammers] I know. I -- I shouldn't even be teasing. With him, it's just -- something is going on I can't explain.",
        "Ivy: Okay, well, you need to try to explain.",
        "Quinn: Nothing is happening.",
        "Ivy: Quinn, I don't believe you.",
        "Quinn: Ivy, please, will you just give it a rest? You're being paranoid.",
        "Ivy: Because I know you and I know that something happened, and if you don't tell me what, I'll go and ask Ridge myself.",
        "Quinn: Okay. Fine. I was in the design office the other day, and I twisted my ankle, and...Ridge put some ice on it for me. He was -- he was nice and attentive.",
        "Ivy: Right, so then what happened in the steam room?",
        "Quinn: I was in there taking a steam already. He -- he's the one who walked in.",
        "Ivy: Did he touch you?",
        "Quinn: A little.",
        "Ivy: What?!",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] Look, he's acting like he's attracted to me.",
        "Ivy: Are you -- are you attracted to him?",
        "Quinn: No, of course not. We're just -- we're messing with each other's heads.",
        "Ivy: Quinn, this is Ridge Forrester we're talking about. You need to be very careful.",
        "Quinn: I know, I know. I can't even stand the guy. Look, I'm married to Eric. I've never been happier. I'm not gonna screw that up!",
        "Ivy: It sounds like Ridge is trying to get in between you and Eric.",
        "Quinn: That thought has definitely crossed my mind. He would do anything to get rid of me. That's why I-I'm not gonna indulge him anymore. These silly little games, they're over. I'm not gonna let Ridge ruin my marriage.",
        "Eric: Look at this. It's the best of times in this house again.",
        "Steffy: It's not a bad setup.",
        "Eric: No, it's not. My wife and I are going to eat caviar, we're gonna sip champagne, and we're gonna toast to the success of our family and of our business, which is running very well, I might add. Due to you. Thank you.",
        "Steffy: Thank you.",
        "Eric: And I'm gonna toast to this wonderful woman, this woman I trust with my very life. And not just her, but her son, too -- Wyatt. Your husband. Look, you moved out. That's great. And I made you C.E.O. Now I'm gonna ask you to do something for me.",
        "Steffy: What? Haven't I already?",
        "Eric: I want you to move in here with Wyatt and Quinn and me.",
        "Steffy: What? Granddad. No, I -- I can't do that. I'm not some gift you can just give your wife. I choose who I live with. I choose who I'm gonna spend the rest of my life with.",
        "Eric: Wyatt wants to work on your marriage. Look, this -- this tattoo hasn't completely faded yet, and this commitment right here, this is from Wyatt. This is not from Liam. The biggest gift you can get from anybody is a committed heart. I want you to have the same thing that I have with Quinn.",
        "Ivy: Quinn, this dress is just gorgeous.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] I wonder where Eric is taking me.",
        "Ivy: I'm worried about you.",
        "Quinn: Don't be.",
        "Ivy: Just -- you have the sweetest man in the world, you have an incredible marriage, an amazing life. I don't want to see you ruin it.",
        "Quinn: I won't. I promise.",
        "Ivy: You're playing with fire where Ridge Forrester is concerned.",
        "Quinn: Look, if his plan is to lure me into his trap and smear my name with his father, I'm not falling for it. No matter what he does, no matter what he tries, I'm not an idiot. And I'm not vulnerable to ridge's huge ego. I am not going to let him destroy my relationship with Eric.",
        "Liam: I'm just saying, you seem awfully confident, and I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing.",
        "Ridge: I see what I see. The way that Quinn looks at me, the way she allows me to touch her...",
        "Liam: Sure. Just awfully hard to imagine she would jeopardize her whole marriage.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, but we're not dealing with a sane person here, are we?",
        "Liam: No, but we're not dealing with a stupid one, either.",
        "Ridge: No. She's already onto me.",
        "Liam: Oh, great. That's -- that's great.",
        "Ridge: Calm down. She's attracted to me because I'm trouble. I can blow her whole world apart, and she likes that.",
        "Liam: That makes no sense.",
        "Ridge: It will.",
        "Liam: Okay. Okay, fine. What about -- what about Brooke?",
        "Ridge: I'm not gonna cross the line. Quinn will. We're all finished setting up, Mr. Forrester.",
        "Eric: Everything looks beautiful, jenny. Thank you. Thank you both.",
        "[Slow jazz music plays]",
        "Eric: [Sighs] Look at you. You're a vision in that dress.",
        "Quinn: It's beautiful.",
        "Eric: I designed it for you.",
        "Quinn: I love it.",
        "Eric: I love being your husband. I've never felt this loved in my life. break the spell that Quinn has I really do 'cause there's",
        "Liam: I mean, I want to believe you can pull this off. I really do 'cause there's nothing I want more than to never see that woman's face again.",
        "Ridge: There's a lot at stake for all of us.",
        "Liam: You -- you think? Yeah, Steffy and I would never have been apart in the first place if it weren't for Quinn. Her holding me hostage left the door open for Wyatt, and he was happy to walk right through. Well, not again. Steffy and I shouldn't have to deal with this anymore.",
        "Ridge: That's why we got to break the spell that Quinn has over my father.",
        "Liam: Okay, but you're assuming that she's gonna risk getting caught for, what, like a fling with her husband's son? You really think you can make that happen?",
        "Ridge: I know I can.",
        "Liam: Does Brooke know about this?",
        "Ridge: Know about what? That I want to get Quinn out of our lives? Sure, she does.",
        "Liam: By any means necessary?",
        "Ridge: Sure.",
        "Liam: And she's okay with that?",
        "Ridge: Yes. I think she would understand.",
        "Liam: You -- you are playing a dangerous game, man.",
        "Ridge: Dangerous enough that if my dad saw any of it, that picture over the fireplace would just disappear.",
        "Liam: Okay, but this is what I'm saying. Everything Quinn has, everything good in her life is because of your dad. You think she's gonna risk all of that?",
        "Ridge: I think she will. We're gonna get that toxic woman out of our lives for good.",
        "Quinn: To you. For being husband of the year, for setting up such a beautiful evening.",
        "Eric: My pleasure.",
        "Quinn: Mmm. Oh. This is such a surprise. And you put out my favorite candles.",
        "Eric: Uh, no, actually, these are my favorite candles.",
        "Quinn: Oh. [Laughs] I thought a little spontaneity was in order. Spice things up a bit. A little flirtation once in a while is a good idea, don't you think? Especially for a married couple. I don't want my bride getting bored.",
        "Quinn: As if that could ever happen.",
        "Eric: It's so easy for me to be with you. I admire you so much. You're so beautiful, and my trust in you is boundless.",
        "Quinn: You are one of a kind. And I don't take that for granted. I don't ever want you to doubt what's in my heart or my commitment to you. You changed my life, Eric. You changed Wyatt's life. You've been... you've been so good to us. It's nights like this that remind me how hard we fought to be together, how many people we had to stand up to. Our love and our marriage is something that I cherish. I don't ever want to do anything to disappoint you. I don't ever want to do anything that will let you down.",
        "Eric: That could never happen.",
        "[Slow piano music plays]",
        "Quinn: [Laughs]",
        "Eric: [Clears throat] May I, uh -- may I have this dance?",
        "Quinn: I thought you would never ask.",
        "Eric: Let me see you.",
        "Quinn: [Giggles]",
        "Eric: Come here.",
        "Quinn: You are the best thing that ever happened to me in my entire life. I never want to lose you.",
        "Quinn: I will get Quinn out of my father's arms. Out of our home. Out of the family. Sometimes love hurts. Dad hurt us by bringing her into our lives. But Quinn's days with him are all but over."
