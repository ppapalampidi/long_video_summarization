        "Liam rants that he doesn't know how Wyatt thinks sometimes. Giving Hope the diamond was so uncool. She says he wanted her to have it for the connection to her line. Liam says this gesture is more than about her line and if she keeps it she will be sending Wyatt a message. Surely she has to get that. He hates that he let his guard down. She begs him to please not let this get in the way of their just now becoming like brothers. He says he knows. It's because he was the one to reach out. Wyatt saved his life and proved he is not like his mother. They were supposed to have an understanding and already Wyatt is being inappropriate by giving her the diamond. And that doesn't even make any sense why Ricardo left Wyatt the diamond in the first place. They barely knew each other. She says they bonded over the diamond. Liam says okay then that is a reason enough that Wyatt should keep the diamond. He wants Hope to text or send an e-mail to Wyatt and give the diamond back. Aly tells Ivy she is sure Hope will do the right thing and give the diamond back to Wyatt. Ivy says it won't be easy. What woman could resist a piece like that. Aly says believe her Wyatt is no prize. He is sneaky and underhanded with manipulations when it comes to Hope. Wyatt walks in and tells Aly it always warms his heart to know he has her support. He tells Ivy she can't believe everything Aly says as she can't stand him and is not exactly objective. Most people think he is a pretty nice guy. Ivy asks if that includes Hope. He says he thinks she will give him a good recommendation. Aly follows and for good measure they can follow that up with Liam's thoughts. Wyatt says in case she has missed it he and his brother are getting along well these days. Rick comes in. Wyatt says he's glad they are all here as he wants them to be a part of it. Wyatt says it is a press conference and the press is on their way. Rick is not sure he likes that without some assurance of what it is about. Wyatt says it is a surprise but if Rick will go with him on this he assures him he will not be sorry. Wyatt says it is the next evolution for HFTF and for Hope. Rick says again in front of his group. He does not like going into this PC blind. Aly makes a smart report like this isn't the first time Wyatt has done something questionable. Wyatt reminds her that was in the past. Maya wants a clue. Wyatt says he has found a way to put HFTF back on the map but bigger than ever this time. Oliver says it is risky. Wyatt says he is that confident that it will be the next big step. But he tells Rick that if he is not onboard he will plug the plug right now; just tell him. Rick tells him to go ahead but do not make him sorry that he agreed to it. Wyatt says great today is going to be a big day for their team.",
        "Brooke answers the door and it's Deacon. She tells him Hope is not here. He says he is there to see her. He wanted to make sure she was okay. She lets him in. He says it feels pretty nice to be able to talk to her without Bill being around. She says she was completely blindsided by this. Bill only wanted to teach Ridge a lesson and that'd take about twenty minutes. Deacon says little boys have bigger toys only they are not make believe any more. Deacon knows what Bill has done and says he bets he did not go away quietly. She says she does not want to be rude but she really doesn't want to discuss this with him. He says he knows they have a complicated history and he doesn't expect them to be best buds right out of the box but he can dream. Hope holds the diamond for Liam to look at more carefully and explains this is not just any diamond but the HFTF diamond. It has special powers. He must feel it. She knows for a fact that it has MAGIC! The second they paired it with the line everything took off. People were completely under it's spell and now it's come back to them. He argues that Wyatt is using it for power to get her to look in his direction again. She says that is not the way she wants him to see this. He says but that is how it is. And shame on him for believing Wyatt could be any other way while he makes his big move. Hope reminds him there was no way that Wyatt knew Ricardo was going to die or leave him the diamond. Liam says but the minute it did fall out of the sky he brought it directly to Hope. He tells her that she has to give it back ..today. The only person who should be giving her a diamond is him. She tells him again this is not a commitment. It is not a promise made, otherwise she would not be accepting it. This is business. This diamond represents the most success that the line has ever seen. Liam asks if she'd like to hear what he sees when he sees the diamond. He sees her and Wyatt splashed over everything .and he knows Wyatt sees it that way too. And that is what Wyatt is counting on. If she accepts this she is sending him mixed signals. He does not think she wants to do that. Her phone rings and it is Wyatt. He says he is in the showroom and needs her there right away. She tells Liam and he thinks that is great. It will be the perfect opportunity for her to give the diamond back. If she doesn't Wyatt will see it as a sign of encouragement and they will be right back where they started .back to a place they do not want to go again. He says his brother is an operator and he's proving it once again. He knows this diamond has meaning to Hope but if it weren't so important he would not be asking her this. She shakes her head yes, okay she will give it back. Deacon tells Brooke that a lot has happened between them, some not so good, things he is not proud of but he wants her to know that he's not that man anymore. She says it seems like he is trying. He says he wants his daughter to be proud of him and say to people that is her dad. He looks at her and is humbled and can not believe he had anything to do with creating that amazing woman. But whatever they went through it was worth it. He asks if she has heard about Wyatt's latest. She is afraid to ask. He fills her in on the diamond and now Wyatt is the proud owner and he has given it to Hope. Brooke is speechless but says Hope will not keep it. Deacon doesn't know why not. And he knows the stone has magical powers. It has a mind of its own and where it wants to be. And that is Hope. It keeps going to her and that is where it wants to be. Hope and Liam are surprised when they go to the showroom and see all the hubbub. Wyatt greets her and won't give her details but says to stay right there. Wyatt slips his jacket on and takes the stage. He welcomes them all here and says they will skip the pleasantries as he knows they are dying to know why they are here. He says he is extremely happy to announce the return of Hope and the HFTF diamond. The audience gasps and flashbulb go off. He explains that Ricardo passed away and willed him the diamond. He calls Hope up on stage. She looks at Liam and he sort of makes a gesture to go ahead. Hope hands Wyatt the diamond and Wyatt holds it up; more flashbulbs go off. He tells Hope that he promised her that he would give this to her one day so now it is hers. All she has to do is take it. The emotions are mixed ..Wyatt is grinning ear to ear, Liam is glowering, Hope looks confused and most in the audience are oohing and aahing."

        "Aly: There is no doubt in my mind. Hope will do the right thing -- give that diamond back to Wyatt.",
        "Ivy: [Sighs] Yeah, well, it can't be easy.",
        "Aly: Why not?",
        "Ivy: Oh, come on. What woman could resist a piece like that?",
        "Aly: Hope is committed to Liam. She can't be accepting outrageous gifts like that from Wyatt.",
        "Ivy: Exactly. Which brings me back to this. Must be nice having two guys stumble over each other just to be with you.",
        "Aly: Trust me. Wyatt is no prize. He is sneaky and underhanded and a master when it comes to manipulating hope.",
        "Wyatt: Thanks, Aly. Always warms my heart to know that I've got your support.",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Deacon: Surprise.",
        "Brooke: Deacon.",
        "Deacon: I'm sorry. It's a bad habit dropping by without calling ahead. I'll -- I'll work on that. But since I'm here, can I come in?",
        "Brooke: Uh, I suppose.",
        "Deacon: You know, I got to tell you, it never gets old coming to this house. It really is beautiful.",
        "Brooke: Hope isn't here.",
        "Deacon: Oh, I didn't come to see hope. I came to see you. I wanted to make sure you're okay.",
        "Wyatt: Am I interrupting?",
        "Aly: Oh, just giving Ivy my opinion.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, well, don't believe everything you hear. Aly can't stand me. She's not exactly objective. I'm actually a really nice guy. Most people back me up on that.",
        "Ivy: Hope being one?",
        "Wyatt: She'd probably give me a high recommendation.",
        "Aly: And then, just for balance, you could check in with Liam.",
        "Wyatt: Haven't you noticed? My brother and I are finally getting along these days.",
        "Aly: Yeah. So it appears.",
        "Wyatt: Anyway... I'm glad you're both here. 'Cause you should be a part of this.",
        "Rick: Sorry about that. I got hung up. What's on your mind?",
        "Wyatt: A press conference. Reporters are already on their way.",
        "Rick: That's fast. Uh, what's your agenda?",
        "Wyatt: It's a surprise.",
        "Rick: Hmm. I don't know if I like that. Not being prepared for a press conference has been known to backfire in the past.",
        "Wyatt: Well, I'm -- I'm prepared, and I just -- I kind of need my team around me.",
        "Rick: Okay, the team is one thing, but I'm gonna need a little more reassurance about this.",
        "Wyatt: Just go with me on this, Rick. I promise you, you won't be sorry.",
        "Rick: All right, fine. But I'm gonna need to know a better idea of what's going on.",
        "Wyatt: Well, let's just say that it's the next evolution for Hope for the Future and for hope.",
        "Hope: This is not like an engagement diamond. This is for the line.",
        "Liam: Oh, that's convenient. God, I never should have let my guard down with him.",
        "Hope: Please don't do this.",
        "Liam: Damn it.",
        "Hope: Please, please don't let this mess things up between the two of you. You just started to act like brothers.",
        "Liam: I know! I know we did, because I reached out! I gave him the benefit of the doubt! I mean, he saved my life, I finally acknowledged that he's not like his mother, and... we're supposed to have this whole, new understanding, you know. And already he's being inappropriate with you, giving you the Hope for the Future diamond! I mean, what is he doing with it, anyway?",
        "Hope: I told you what happened. Ricardo left it to him.",
        "Liam: But why? I mean, they -- they barely even knew each other! That doesn't make any sense!",
        "Hope: [Sighs] They bonded over this diamond!",
        "Liam: Bonded. Okay.",
        "Hope: Yes!",
        "Liam: Okay, fine. Fine. Then that right there -- that is a reason for Wyatt to keep the diamond. Can you just -- can you send him a text or an e-mail? Tell him to meet you and... and give it back.",
        "Carter: You called a surprise press conference?",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] Spontaneous with a surprise reveal.",
        "Oliver: A secret, even to the people in this room?",
        "Rick: I'll say it again. I don't like going in blind.",
        "Aly: Caution's appropriate. Not like you haven't been questionable in the past.",
        "Wyatt: [Sighs] Key word -- past, Aly.",
        "Aly: Oh, right, 'cause this is new and improved Wyatt.",
        "Maya: At least give us a clue.",
        "Wyatt: Well, I figured out another way to put hope for a future back on the map again, but bigger than ever.",
        "Ivy: Sounds intriguing.",
        "Wyatt: Everything is set up. I already made the calls. The reporters will be here shortly.",
        "Oliver: It's risky going forward without consensus.",
        "Wyatt: Look, I am that confident that this is the right next step for the line. But look, if -- if you're not fully confident in me running with this, just tell me. I-I will pull the plug right now.",
        "Rick: No. No, go ahead. Just don't make me sorry that I agreed to it.",
        "Wyatt: You won't be sorry. And get ready, because today is gonna be a big day for our team.",
        "Deacon: I got to tell you, Brooke, it's actually kind of nice talking to you without Bill around. Is this how it's gonna be from now on?",
        "Brooke: I-I don't know what to think. I got completely blindsided again.",
        "Deacon: You trusted him. I mean, he said he didn't have Ridge dumped from that chopper. You believed him.",
        "Brooke: Anything else was unthinkable that he could even do something like that. Ridge almost died.",
        "Deacon: Yeah, somehow I don't think Bill was too concerned with that.",
        "Brooke: He said he wanted to teach him a lesson, that it would only take 20 minutes.",
        "Deacon: Little boys and their toys, right? Only the toys get bigger and the hurt isn't make-believe anymore. Now, if I know Spencer, he didn't go away quietly, did he?",
        "Brooke: Look, I don't feel really comfortable talking to you about Bill.",
        "Deacon: Sorry. No problem.",
        "Brooke: I don't mean to be rude. It's just...",
        "Deacon: No, no, there's no need for an explanation. Hey, look, we have a complicated history, you and me, you know, and I don't think we're gonna be best buds right out of the box.",
        "Brooke: Best buds? [Chuckles] No, I don't think so.",
        "Deacon: Don't step on my dreams.",
        "Liam: Are you seriously hesitating right now?",
        "Hope: This is not just any diamond! This -- this is the Hope for the Future diamond. I mean, it's special. Look at it! Can you not feel the power that this thing holds?",
        "Liam: I guess. I don't know. Why are you asking me this?",
        "Hope: I -- okay. Uh, this is gonna sound so crazy. I know it's weird. But trust me -- I know for a fact that this diamond carries... magic.",
        "Liam: Magic?",
        "Hope: Yes! I-I-I know. But don't you remember what it did for the line? The second we paired it, everything took off. People were completely under its spell, and now it's come back to us in almost the same way from Ricardo through Wyatt to me, and I think maybe -- maybe there's a reason or something, and I don't know. I should -- I should hold on to it. I don't know.",
        "Liam: Okay, all right. Wait. You think -- [Sighs] You think that this thing has magic powers...",
        "Hope: Yeah.",
        "Liam: ...Because of what it did for your line?",
        "Hope: Yes.",
        "Liam: Okay. Okay. Think about at that same time in our lives what it was doing to our relationship, because we were falling apart, hope. And now -- and now Wyatt is gonna use this thing as a ploy to get you looking in his direction again.",
        "Hope: That's -- that's not how I want you to see this.",
        "Liam: Yeah, but that's how it is, and -- and, you know, shame on me. Shame on me for thinking Wyatt could behave in any other way, bro'ing me to death while he calculated his next big move.",
        "Hope: No! Liam, Wyatt had no idea that Ricardo was going to die and leave him the diamond!",
        "Liam: And yet the minute that thing comes falling out of the sky and into his hands, what does he do? He brings it to you.",
        "Hope: Well --",
        "Liam: Hope, you have to give it back to him...today.",
        "Deacon: There was a lot that went down between us, not all of it good, a lot of it that I'm not proud of. But for what it's worth, I'm better than that guy now.",
        "Brooke: It seems like you're trying.",
        "Deacon: You know, I want -- I want our daughter to be proud of me. I want her to be able to say, \"that's my dad.\" I look at her, and I swear, I am so -- I'm humbled. I mean, I can't believe that I actually had anything to do with the creation of that amazing woman.",
        "Brooke: Same here.",
        "Deacon: And, you know, whatever we had to go through, scorched earth and all, it was worth it. Oh, so, uh, have you heard about Wyatt's latest?",
        "Brooke: Uh, no. I'm afraid to ask.",
        "Deacon: Wait a second. You don't know about the gift?",
        "Brooke: No.",
        "Deacon: You know that guy who owned the Hope for the Future diamond?",
        "Brooke: Ricardo Montemayor.",
        "Deacon: Yeah, yeah, that's him. Okay. Was he a friend?",
        "Brooke: No, I didn't really know him. \"Was\"?",
        "Deacon: Um, yeah, he died. He left the diamond to Wyatt. Wyatt gave the diamond to hope.",
        "Rick: You okay?",
        "Carter: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. I was just, uh... I was gonna marry a woman it turns out I don't even know. I mean, is she that good or am I that dumb?",
        "Rick: Maya is complicated. She got a lot going on at the surface. She's had a tough life, as you know, and she was in prison because of some loser. She lost her baby. And now she has a chance at getting a little control and power, something that she's never had before.",
        "Carter: It doesn't make it all right to betray people who trust you.",
        "Rick: No, it doesn't.",
        "Oliver: I hope this doesn't take too long. I need my Aly time.",
        "Aly: What do you want to do? Movie?",
        "Oliver: I've had enough of Pele for the day. I just want to hang out with my lady.",
        "Aly: \"My lady.\" I like that.",
        "Oliver: I love saying it. When I think about how close I came to losing you...",
        "Aly: Don't. You didn't. I'm right here. He seems awfully full of himself.",
        "Oliver: Must be some announcement he's about to make. Excuse me.",
        "Aly: Wonder if it has something to do with the diamond.",
        "Liam: Hope, you and I are getting married. I mean, the only person you should be accepting diamonds from is me.",
        "Hope: I know that. But this is not a commitment. This is not a promise made. If it were, I would not be accepting it. This is business. This is for the line.",
        "Liam: No. No.",
        "Hope: Liam, this diamond is associated with the most success that Hope for the Future has ever seen.",
        "Liam: Do you want to know what I see when I look at that diamond? You want to know what I associate it with? U and Wyatt splashed all over everything. That's how he sees it, too. That's -- that's what he's counting on, hope. And if you accept this gift from him, you are sending him mixed signals, and I don't think you want to do that.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Hope: It's Wyatt.",
        "Liam: Take it. Take it.",
        "Hope: Hi.",
        "Wyatt: Hey, I'm in the showroom. Uh, I need you here right away.",
        "Hope: Uh, why? What's up?",
        "Wyatt: Just hurry, okay?",
        "Hope: Okay. Wyatt wants to see me in the showroom.",
        "Liam: Great. Oh, great. Great. No, this is good. This is a perfect opportunity for you to give him his diamond back.",
        "Liam: Come on, hope. You have to understand what it means if you keep this diamond. I mean, Wyatt will see it as a sign of encouragement, and then we'll be right back where we started.",
        "Hope: Not if I make myself very clear.",
        "Liam: [Sighs] We're finally moving forward, hope. We're finally getting on track to that life we've always wanted, and -- and keeping this diamond sets us back to a place that we don't want to go again. My brother is an operator, and he just proved it. He will take advantage like he always takes advantage. I know what I'm asking of you, okay? I know that I'm asking you to give up something that has meaning to you. But if I didn't think it was so important for us, I promise you I wouldn't be.",
        "Hope: Okay. Okay. I'll give the diamond back. I will.",
        "Liam: Thank you.",
        "Hope: I'll give it back.",
        "Liam: Thank you. Thank you.",
        "Hope: Yeah.",
        "Liam: Thank you.",
        "Brooke: I don't know what to react to first. Ricardo Montemayor gave the diamond to Wyatt?",
        "Deacon: Yeah, well, I guess he didn't have any family.",
        "Brooke: What about friends? I mean, he hardly even knew Wyatt.",
        "Deacon: Look, whatever happened, they bonded over the love for the diamond. At least that's what I'm hearing, right? But you got to love a guy that gives your daughter priceless, famous stones.",
        "Brooke: That jewel has a lot of symbolism for hope and Wyatt.",
        "Deacon: Because of Hope for the Future?",
        "Brooke: Well, that and basically that's how their relationship started.",
        "Deacon: Oh. Well, Wyatt's hoping that's gonna happen again.",
        "Brooke: No, she won't keep it.",
        "Deacon: Why not?",
        "Brooke: She can't.",
        "Deacon: It's a gift.",
        "Brooke: It's a gift, a diamond, from Wyatt!",
        "Deacon: No, no, no. It's the mother lode of all diamonds.",
        "Brooke: Yes, exactly, and that makes it worse.",
        "Deacon: Brooke, this thing is supposed to have magical properties, right? I mean, that's what I hear, okay? So it's got a mind of its own. It's got a place that it wants to be, and it keeps going to hope. It wants to be with her, you know? She ought to wear the thing, keep it. Hell, she ought to flaunt it!",
        "Brooke: [Chuckles] God, you would say that. That's why I'm going to advise her in the situation.",
        "Deacon: Well, who would have more experience with being the most beautiful, most desirable woman in the world? Men falling at your feet, offering you diamonds the size of Rhode island.",
        "Brooke: You're flattering me.",
        "Deacon: Is it working?",
        "Brooke: [Chuckles]",
        "Jarrett: Ooh, Wyatt, not too late for an exclusive.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] Nice try, Jarrett. You're gonna hear about it with everybody else. [Chuckles] Feel this is gonna be big. Something splashy that says \"Wyatt's back.\" Hmm.",
        "Hope: What is this?",
        "Liam: Whoa. Hey, listen, thank you for doing this. I really, really do think it's gonna be better for our relationship if you just give it back.",
        "Hope: Yeah, yeah. No, I understand.",
        "Liam: [Sighs]",
        "Wyatt: Oh, good! You're here. Now we can start.",
        "Hope: What's going on?",
        "Wyatt: Press conference. Big announcement. Uh, stay right here, okay? All right, everyone. [Clears throat] Let's get started. Uh, thank you all for coming. I will skip the pleasantries, as I'm sure you're all dying to know why you're here.",
        "Jarrett: Sure are.",
        "[Laughter]",
        "Wyatt: Well, all right. Straight to the point. I am extremely excited to announce the return of hope and the Hope for the Future diamond.",
        "[Everyone gasps]",
        "[Chatter]",
        "Wyatt: As you all know, the Hope for the Future diamond has been hugely significant for Forrester Creations and for hope and me. Um, sadly, Ricardo Montemayor, the owner of the diamond, recently passed away. Um, amazingly enough, he willed it to me.",
        "[Everyone gasps]",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] Yeah. Yeah. Uh, hope?",
        "[Chatter]",
