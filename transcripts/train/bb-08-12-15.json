        "Thomas assures Steffy that Aly was in attack mode and this is not Steffy's fault. Steffy is still worried. Ivy was there that night and has been acting weird ever since. Thomas says she really knows nothing and Steffy is not to worry. Just leave it to him. He will do whatever to protect her. Maya tells Vivienne that she loves her too. She tells Nick they do not need any more time. She stopped the wedding because she thought her dad might ruin the day. She tells Rick they are going to do this. Nick starts that Maya has proclaimed her independence just as America did in the beginning and he is proud to officiate. Eric is also proud that so many great moments have happened here in this room with family showing their support. He hugs Rick and says with Maya he has become the man he always knew he would be. Ivy tells Wyatt that she has been waiting for Steffy to go to the police but she is working like nothing has ever happened. She needs to take responsibility for this.",
        "Vivienne gives the first reading from Shakespeare. Nicole gives another by a poet. Ivy is working on a piece of jewelry when Thomas comes in and startles her. He says he did not know Aly well but he knows she had issues and he is sorry Ivy was there when all of this went down. She agrees Aly was troubled but she did not deserve this .and Steffy is no saint. Thomas tells her it was an unfortunate accident. And she needs to be careful as what she says might be misunderstood. She jumps at him and says his sister came back and got Liam with no respect that he was in a relationship with Ivy. She was there that night and saw exactly what happened. Wyatt wants to talk to Steffy about some jewelry but she is distracted. She says Ivy has been saying things about her and she wants it to stop. She knows how close they are so maybe she will listen to him. Steffy tells Wyatt that she does not want this to get ugly. He scoffs that this must be bothering her. Steffy just thinks Aly should be quiet and mourn Aly like the rest are doing. Thomas and Ivy discuss the night more. She says Aly did not just fall. Steffy hit her with a tire iron. She is just telling everyone that Aly fell. She has proof. She goes and gets her phone and shows Thomas the video. He arches his eyebrow in surprise, but says it is her word against Steffy's. She thinks the entire world has a right to see this. Nick asks Maya and Rick to say their vows and exchange rings. He then is happy to pronounce them husband and wife and they may kiss."

        "Maya: [Sighs] I love you, too, Mom.",
        "Vivienne: [Chuckles] [Sighs]",
        "Nicole: That goes for me, too.",
        "[All chuckling]",
        "Nick: Do we need a minute?",
        "Maya: No. No. We stopped the wedding because I was afraid my dad would ruin it. But he's gone. So, we're doing this.",
        "Thomas: Steff, you were protecting yourself.",
        "Steffy: Aly was just standing over me. That look in her eyes -- pure hate.",
        "Thomas: She attacked you.",
        "Steffy: But I don't -- I don't know. That's the thing. I don't know what set her off.",
        "Thomas: Aly tried to kill you. Of course things are gonna be a little bit fuzzy. You were in survival mode.",
        "Steffy: That's not the only thing I'm worried about. Ivy was there that night. She's been acting really weird ever since.",
        "Ivy: I've just -- I've been waiting for Steffy to just go to the police and -- and admit the truth about what happened.",
        "Wyatt: Well, you rattled her cage pretty hard.",
        "Ivy: Mm, not hard enough.",
        "Liam: [Scoffs] I figured after the memorial, her conscience would have gotten to her.",
        "Ivy: Yeah. That's because you're assuming she has one.",
        "Wyatt: Well, come on.",
        "Ivy: Look, Wyatt, seriously. She -- she comes into work, she gets on with her business like the accident with Aly never happened. But it did happen. We know that. Aly would still be here if it wasn't for Steffy, and she needs to take responsibility for that.",
        "Thomas: Okay, Ivy didn't come right out and accuse you.",
        "Steffy: She got close.",
        "Thomas: But she would have if she could?",
        "Steffy: [Scoffs] The way she feels about me? Yeah.",
        "Thomas: So, obviously she can't.",
        "Steffy: She said Aly's death wasn't an accident, that she knows what really happened.",
        "Thomas: You were defending yourself. That's what really happened.",
        "Steffy: But she asked me if I lied to the police. Why would she ask that?",
        "Thomas: To get back at you for Liam. To make you feel the way you are feeling right now.",
        "Steffy: No. She's not trying to make me feel insecure about Liam. Ivy implied that I am responsible for Aly's death.",
        "Nick: Family can be complicated. That's why it's especially important on days like today to remember that beneath all the complication and all of the pain, there can be love. The love that Maya and Rick feel from you today will strengthen their commitment to one another. They will be stronger because you stand with them today at the altar, in their everyday lives, and in your hearts.",
        "Steffy: Ivy's the one that called 911.",
        "Thomas: So, it just happened.",
        "Steffy: She didn't see anything. If she did, she would have said something, but she didn't.",
        "Thomas: Okay. See? There's nothing to worry about.",
        "Steffy: She suspects something.",
        "Thomas: Who cares? We are the only ones who know what actually happened, and we're not going to say anything to anyone. Promise me.",
        "Steffy: Okay. Yes. What are we, kids? I-I promise. Yes.",
        "Thomas: You are still my little sister. And we are gonna be there for each other, no matter what. That's our promise. If you need to come talk to somebody, you come to me, nobody else. And don't get into it with Ivy. You've been through enough, Steff. You don't have to deal with her, too. Hey. You can count on me. I'm your big brother. And I am gonna do whatever it takes to protect you.",
        "Nick: So, when they swear you in as deputy marriage commissioner, you have to take an oath of office. [Chuckling] It's really official. So, I'm standing there in the courthouse, thinking about what I want to say today. And...these words came to me. \"We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\" That's how America began. That's how our country declared its independence. That's also how Maya and I began our separate but shared journeys to becoming our true selves. First, we had to believe we had the right, that we deserved to be as free and happy in our own skins as everybody else, not abused or made to feel ashamed for who we are. Maya found that belief. And then she found a man who shared it. And I am so pleased to take part in joining the two of you together.",
        "Eric: I am very proud, too. There's been a lot of weddings in this room. Zende, your mom and dad got married right here. Not too long ago, I said goodbye to my granddaughter Aly in this room. This is where our family comes together to celebrate and support each other. That's what these two are doing here today. With Maya, my son has become the man I knew he always would be. Come here, buddy.",
        "Nick: Maya asked her mother to do the first reading.",
        "Vivienne: Shakespeare wrote, \"love is not love which alters when it alteration finds, or bends with the remover to remove. Oh, no. It is an ever-fixed mark that looks on tempests and is never shaken. It is the star to every wandering bark.\" Maya, Rick, your love is true. Let it be your compass. Let it guide you into your future, pointing you in the right direction through every kind of weather. The love that brought you together will never steer you wrong. Mnh- mnh. No. It's a blessing to you... an inspiration to all of us.",
        "Nicole: This is a reading from the poet Dante Alighieri. \"La vita Nuova,\" the new life. \"In that book which is my memory, on the first page, that is the chapter when I first met you, appear the words, 'here begins a new life.'\" We all have those moments -- days that make a difference, change things so much that anything afterwards feels brand-new. The day that Rick and Maya met was a day like that.",
        "Maya: [Chuckles]",
        "Nicole: And this one is, too.",
        "Maya: [Laughs]",
        "Thomas: Got a minute?",
        "Ivy: Uh...",
        "Thomas: Just talking to Steffy. I-I guess you said something to her.",
        "Ivy: I said quite a few things to her, actually. Why? Did I strike a nerve?",
        "Thomas: Were you trying to upset her?",
        "Ivy: Is she upset?",
        "Thomas: We're all upset, Ivy. We just lost our cousin.",
        "Ivy: [Sighs]",
        "Thomas: Look, I-I know you were friends with her and that you were there when she died. I'm sorry you had to experience that. But this has been difficult for all of us, no one more than my sister. I wasn't here. I-I didn't know what was going on with Aly. It's clear that she had serious issues.",
        "Ivy: She was an extremely troubled person, Thomas, but she didn't deserve what happened to her. Aly might have been sick, but your sister is no saint.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Wyatt: Hi.",
        "Steffy: Hi. What's that?",
        "Wyatt: Ivy's latest. You sent that e-mail. I know we got a little behind with everything, but, uh --",
        "Steffy: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Wyatt: How are you doing?",
        "Steffy: All right. Just, uh, focused on work.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, Ivy's doing that, too. She's not really having much luck, though.",
        "Steffy: You know what? Let's just -- let's not talk about Ivy. Things are a little tense between us. I'm sure you already know that, considering how close you two are.",
        "Wyatt: There's no keeping secrets around here... you know, with Pam and all.",
        "Steffy: She should watch the way she talks to people.",
        "Wyatt: Who? Pam?",
        "Steffy: Ivy. She's been saying dangerous things about me, Wyatt. I want it to stop.",
        "Thomas: What happened to Aly that night was an accident. What she did to Steffy, though --",
        "Ivy: No, what happened to Aly that night, Thomas, cost her her life.",
        "Thomas: You should be careful, Ivy. What you're saying could be misunderstood.",
        "Ivy: Look, I know that you think your sister is the victim in all of this. But like I said, she is no saint. You don't know what it's been like since she's been back, the way she worked at getting Liam back with zero respect for our relationship, with zero respect for Aly.",
        "Thomas: What happened that night was a traumatic experience for Steffy, okay? Aly tried to kill her, and now you're making veiled threats?",
        "Ivy: I asked her a very simple question.",
        "Thomas: I want you to stay away from her.",
        "Ivy: [Scoffs]",
        "Thomas: Don't even hint that she is responsible for what happened.",
        "Ivy: Well, it's the truth, Thomas. I wish it wasn't. I really mean that. But I was there that night. I saw exactly what happened.",
        "Nick: Rick and Maya, please join hands and state your intentions to one another. \"I, Maya, take you, Rick, to be my lawfully wedded husband.\"",
        "Maya: I, Maya, take you, Rick, to be my lawfully wedded husband, to have and to hold, in good times and in bad, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health. I will be faithful to you for all the days of my life.",
        "Nick: Rick.",
        "Rick: [Sighs] I, Rick, take you, Maya, to be my lawfully wedded wife, to have and to hold from this day forward, in good times and bad, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health. And I will be faithful to you all the days of my life.",
        "Nick: Exchange these rings and wear them as a symbol of the commitment you make today and a reminder that you are surrounded and encircled with love. Maya, place this ring on Rick's finger and repeat after me. \"Take this ring as a reminder of my love for you and faith in our marriage.\"",
        "Maya: Take this ring as a reminder of my love for you and faith in our marriage.",
        "Rick: Take this ring as a reminder of my love for you, my pride, gratitude, and faith in our marriage.",
        "Steffy: I don't want this to get ugly.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] So, what Ivy's saying bothers you.",
        "Steffy: I am president of this company. And I think it would be in Ivy's best interest to mourn Aly's death like the rest of us and focus on her work.",
        "Thomas: Steff told me that you called 911.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, because I thought Aly could still be saved. But I think she was already gone. She hadn't moved and she wasn't breathing.",
        "Thomas: I'm sorry about that. Steffy told me what happened, how Aly fell.",
        "Ivy: No, Thomas. That's not how she died. She didn't just fall and -- and hit her head. Aly and Steffy were fighting.",
        "Thomas: Aly attacked her. There was a struggle and Aly fell.",
        "Ivy: No, but that's just it. Steffy is lying. Steffy hit Aly with a tire iron.",
        "Thomas: No. No, a-Aly hit her head when she fell.",
        "Ivy: No! That's just what Steffy's telling everybody.",
        "Thomas: And now you're saying something different.",
        "Ivy: I'm saying the truth.",
        "Thomas: It's just your word against hers.",
        "Ivy: No, because I have proof. Here. Look. And now you see exactly what your sister's done. And I don't know why the whole world shouldn't see it, too.",
        "Nick: Rick and Maya, you may now say your vows. The promises you make today will connect and guide you for the rest of your lives.",
        "Rick: Maya, I-I grew up in a privileged family. I thought I had everything.. until I met you. The confidence that you've given me is greater than any success. Your love is more satisfying than any achievement. And again today, you taught me what true courage is and that there's nothing more powerful than love and acceptance. My promise to you is to be the husband that you inspire me to be, to be open and honest and understanding and accepting. And I promise not to let a day go by that I don't tell you just how much I appreciate that and the gratitude for everything that you taught me. My vow is to love you in every stage of our lives, no matter how much we change or grow together.",
        "Maya: Rick, I vow to love you in every stage of our lives, no matter how much we change or grow together. And I promise to live up to the faith that you have put in me and to cherish the connection that we have and the life that we've built together, because it is so precious to me. I didn't grow up with the love and support that I have now in you, in your family, in my family. And before I met you, I never dreamed that I could feel this kind of love and -- and support and acceptance and peace. You have given me such an incredible gift, and I want to share it with the world in the work that I do, in the way that I live my life, in being the woman that I truly am, and most of all, in being a devoted wife to you. I love you so much.",
        "Rick: I love you, too.",
        "Nick: Rick and Maya, you have pledged yourselves to one another with solemn vows and the exchanging of rings. And so it is with sincere happiness that I pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss your bride.",
        "[Cheers and applause]",
        "Nick: I present to you Rick and Maya Forrester."
