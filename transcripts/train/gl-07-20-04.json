        "Bellhop: Mrs. Spaulding? A gift from an admirer.",
        "Olivia: Oh, that's no admirer. That's my husband. Hey, honey, why don't grab on to those thorns and squeeze them good and tight? Come on.",
        "Phillip: What news do you have from bill Lewis?",
        "Olivia: Bill. I called bill. I left some messages, but it appears you've threw them, far away, better than you thought.",
        "Phillip: Don't give me excuses. Just get it done.",
        "Jeffrey: I am so... so jet lagged. Do you got any water around here? It's right here.",
        "Bellhop: Was your trip to Europe about business or pleasure, Mr. O'Neill?",
        "Jeffrey: I plead the fifth. Thank you. (Phone rings)",
        "Dinah: Hello, Jeffrey.",
        "Jeffrey: How did you know it was me?",
        "Dinah: Who else knows that I'm imprisoned in this hotel room?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, yeah, that's some prison. They charge you ten bucks just to refill the ice bucket.",
        "Dinah: Actually 11. But you know, you don't need worry, because I am certainly using my own money. You know, I... I really enjoyed the tangoing that we did last night. It's amazing isn't it, how our bodies still fit so well together.",
        "Jeffrey: This isn't a personal call, Dinah.",
        "Dinah: It's always personal between us. Admit it. You missed hearing my voice.",
        "Cassie: Yes, I would like to check the most recent activity on my account. Sure, I'll hold. \"Princess Cass\u00ede, woman of mystery.\" \"Princess Cass\u00ede, keeps the paparazzi guessing.\" Well, I'm going to find you, princess Cass\u00ede.",
        "Gus: No, because I have been trying to reach Alex since last night. Yeah, so why don't you just... Oh, really? So now it's a spa. When did she... Never mind. What's the name of the spa? I said what is the... Listen, you know what it is? You know what? I can't stand liars.",
        "Harley: Wow, who was that?",
        "Gus: I just called down to the station to see about the madness before I go down there. I'm going to go down.",
        "Harley: I hoped it was frank saying that IA had called saying they'd made a terrible mistake and they were dropping the charges and reinstating him.",
        "Gus: The charges are bogus, okay, so IA will never be able to make them stick. Don't worry.",
        "Harley: Well, we both know the charges are bogus, but IA's made cases out of a lot less than this.",
        "Gus: I'm the acting chief of police, now. They're going to have to go through me. I'm not going to make it easy for them. I love you. I got to go.",
        "Harley: I love you.",
        "Gus: Whoa!",
        "Harley: Oh, hi, Eliza. Sweetie, this Eliza. Our caterer.",
        "Gus: Oh, yeah, nice to meet you. I mean, nice to meet you again.",
        "Caterer: I thought you'd both like to look at the new menu.",
        "Harley: New menu? I didn't realize there was something wrong with the old one.",
        "Caterer: Mrs. Spaulding thought we should offer more variety.",
        "Gus: When did Mrs. Spaulding make these changes?",
        "Caterer: Just this morning about an hour ago.",
        "Gus: Excuse me. You spoke to my aunt this morning? Do you know where she is?",
        "Jeremy: Mrs. Spaulding, that call just now was Mr. Gus again.",
        "Alexandra: Well, you did tell him I left for the spa, didn't you? Good. And tell Bruno to bring the car around. I'll be ready to leave in a few moments.",
        "Jeremy: Yes, ma'am.",
        "Alexandra: Fritz? Alexandra Spaulding. Yes, I'm ready to go ahead to go ahead with that bank transfer we discussed. A million even. Yes, to be deposited in private account in your Zurich branch. To be deposited under the names of brad green and frank cooper. No, I want it traceable.",
        "Gus: You spoke to my aunt Alex this morning? So do you know where she is?",
        "Caterer: She was at the mansion. Harley, I'm sorry. I have another appointment.",
        "Harley: No, that's fine. You know what? You go. Really. I'll hash this out with Mrs. Spaulding myself. Thank you, Eliza.",
        "Gus: Honey, I'm leaving too. So...",
        "Harley: No, really, you could go. Go ahead. Leave me alone in my misery to hash out an issue with your aunt that I thought we settled already. You know what? I can't do this today. Okay. This is not what I want to do today. Today is my day to pick out something new and blue, and to do the final fitting on my wedding dress. And with the time that I had left, I was going to try to figure out who it is framing my brother and ruining his life. But you know what I'll do instead? I'll decide between bisque and consume.",
        "Gus: Yo. Honey.",
        "Harley: What?",
        "Gus: If you want to postpone the wedding, I would understand, you know.",
        "Harley: I don't want to postpone the wedding. Why? Do you want to postpone the wedding?",
        "Gus: I just want, you know, happy wife, happy life. I just want you to be happy.",
        "Harley: I am happy. There's just, you know, there's wedding decisions to be made. It's stressful, weddings are stressful.",
        "Gus: I'm not talking about the wedding plans or anything like that. I'm talking about frank.",
        "Harley: Honey, we've waited so long to do this. And more importantly all the plans are made. I love you. I want to be your wife. I just... I'm worried about my brother, okay. I want to help him, and I don't know how to do that. So please go to work.",
        "Gus: You don't know how to help him, but I do.",
        "Ross: Thanks for coming in this morning. I just have a couple of things to go over with you.",
        "Frank: Really? Well, you know what? Am I going to need my union rep present here?",
        "Ross: Don't make this any more difficult than it has to be.",
        "Frank: Me? You're the one that's made it difficult. You're the one that got the ball rolling, and I'm just along for the ride.",
        "Ross: Listen, frank, I didn't have a choice. I got a tip about corruption and the delirium case. I call in internal affairs, and they find a file of incriminating evidence in your briefcase.",
        "Frank: Circumstantial evidence that was planted.",
        "Ross: Frank, that's theory. Can you give me something, anything to corroborate that?",
        "Frank: Yeah, I'll give you something. Hey Patrick, whatever happened to until innocent until proven guilty?",
        "Ross: Frank, you've already got two strikes against you, all right. There's the physical evidence",
        "frank: Motive? What to protect Darci? She told me herself her involvement with Salerno and green.",
        "Ross: Frank, how many times in your career have you been in as situation where you've had to arrest somebody that you know and respect? Maybe you even loved?",
        "Frank: Many times. What exactly are you saying, Ross?",
        "Ross: All I'm saying is that's a tough spot to be in. And if you found yourself in that situation vis-\u00e0-vis the woman you love and in a moment of weakness you happen to make a mistake would you tell me? Just talk to me about it, frank, and together we could get you out of this.",
        "Frank: What exactly are you asking me to do? You're asking me to confess or to lie?",
        "Phillip: Isn't that what you want for her?",
        "Phillip: Any time in the afternoon is fine. Yep, I'll wait to hear from you.",
        "Olivia: You know if bill is giving me the cold shoulder, it's your fault. You're the one who told him to keep his distance from me for the sake of our blissful marriage. I'm amazed you got the words out with straight face.",
        "Phillip: Olivia, I have great respect for marriage. Without it, we'd just be two parents hating each other. With it, we hate each other with a purpose.",
        "Olivia: So our daughter will inherit the earth and everything in it.",
        "Phillip: Isn't that what you want for her?",
        "Olivia: I thought the meek shall inherit the earth?",
        "Phillip: We both know that only the meek believe that. Lewis is a threat. So I want you to get close to bill and find out everything that's he's up to. I don't care how.",
        "Jeffrey: The only reason I'm calling you is to make sure you haven't flown your gilded cage, and to remind you of our deal. If you don't stop impersonating Cass\u00ede Winslow, your relative freedom will be short lived.",
        "Dinah: And did you tell me that while you here? Because really I can only remember you kissing me.",
        "Jeffrey: No more games, Dinah. I gave you a new lease on life. I suggest you take advantage of it.",
        "Dinah: Look I will do what you want me to do if you do one little bitty thing for me.",
        "Jeffrey: What?",
        "Dinah: Tell me something, honestly.",
        "Jeffrey: What?",
        "Dinah: When you're lying all alone on your bed at night, do you think of me, Jeffrey? About how incredible we were?",
        "Jeffrey: Good-bye, Dinah.",
        "Cassie: This is insane. Not a single picture of her.",
        "RJ: What's that?",
        "Cassie: Well, these are a bunch of magazines that mommy bought with a lot of crazy stories in them.",
        "RJ: Read me a story.",
        "Cassie: I don't think you want to hear any of these stories. But I can tell you a story. You want me to tell you a story? Come on, here. Okay. I'm going to tell you a story about a little boy who lived on a farm. A little boy who lived on a farm and a beautiful princess appeared. Do you remember when mommy used to be a princess when she lived in san Cristobal?",
        "RJ: Mm-hmm.",
        "Cassie: Remember when we lived in the palace? Yeah. Okay, so the princess appeared and she had wonderful stories to tell about all the fancy places she had been and all the famous she'd met. And she got to ride around in a big, beautiful silver car with a chauffeur, of course. And she got to wear beautiful evening gowns just like the ones that mommy got to wear when she was a princess. And she had shiny magical shoes, a beautiful cape, a beautiful red cape.",
        "RJ: Like that one?",
        "Cassie: What do you mean like this one? Let me see that. Oh, my gosh, RJ. You're right. There she is. There's the princess.",
        "Cassie: Well, you're right, RJ. There's the princess. And the beautiful red cape courtesy of mommy. The way that picture's taken I can't see her face. Can you see her face?",
        "RJ: Mm-mm.",
        "Cassie: Me neither. Hmm.",
        "Edmund: Ice cream at this hour? Now who told you could have that young man? Oh, well, she told you that, did she? Well, I guess she's right, because mommy's knows best.",
        "Cassie: Yes.",
        "Edmund: Hello.",
        "Cassie: Hello, there. So how are you?",
        "Edmund: Well... Thank you.",
        "Cassie: What are you doing here?",
        "Edmund: I've come to collect you for our date.",
        "Cassie: Oh, is it that time?",
        "Edmund: Yes, it is.",
        "Cassie: I'm sorry. We've been all about monkey bars and ice cream. (Laughs)",
        "RJ: And stories.",
        "Edmund: Ooh, stories. Well, I love a good story. What stories has your mother been telling you?",
        "RJ: A princess with a cape.",
        "Edmund: A princess with a cape. And here I thought your mother had finished with the princess stories.",
        "Cassie: RJ likes fairytales.",
        "Edmund: I see.",
        "Cassie: Come on, sweetie. Aren't you coming?",
        "Edmund: Oh, yes, I think I am.",
        "Dinah: (Screaming)",
        "Jeffrey: Now is that anyway to treat someone who's here to help you, Dinah?",
        "Dinah: You're American. Who are you?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, let's just say I work for the united states government and I have a proposal for you.",
        "Dinah: What sort of proposal?",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, the normal kind. You see, I need a wife.",
        "Dinah: You want to marry me?",
        "Jeffrey: That's right. As soon as possible.",
        "Dinah: Why don't you tell me what stole your heart finally? My glamorous looks or my incredible environment here?",
        "Jeffrey: You could have both. With the right hair, with the right make-up. A manicure.",
        "Dinah: Okay. Change of scenery might be nice.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, that goes without saying.",
        "Dinah: And the right husband, of course.",
        "Jeffrey: You know with the right coaching, miss Marler, I think we could pass you off as royalty.",
        "Dinah: Royalty. Okay. Well, I think... Well, that might be the wildest line I'd ever heard. And I've heard plenty.",
        "Jeffrey: It's not a line, Dinah. I could be your savior if you let me.",
        "Dinah: I'm listening.",
        "Edmund: Well, if it isn't our illustrious district attorney.",
        "Jeffrey: Edmund.",
        "Edmund: Let's have a status report, Mr. O'Neill.",
        "Jeffrey: On what?",
        "Edmund: On the woman who's been impersonating Cass\u00ede. Have you found her yet?",
        "Olivia: Wow. So you decided to trash the place a second time, did you?",
        "Bill: If you're looking for a power lunch, all I got is cold beer and cold cuts.",
        "Olivia: That's fine with me. I'm plenty hot already.",
        "Bill: Yeah, well, what are you doing here, Olivia? I thought I made it clear, I'm not looking for a partner, in or out of bed.",
        "Olivia: Why is that again?",
        "Bill: Too many complications. Like your husband.",
        "Olivia: Oh, my husband. Look, I thought I told you I'm married in name only.",
        "Bill: Yeah, well, somebody better clue in Phillip.",
        "Olivia: Are you kidding me? He's knows. He's just yanking your chain and you fell for it. No, really, I thought you'd be a little less impressionable.",
        "Bill: Yeah.",
        "Olivia: All right. Let's just... Forget about the sex. I mean, it's highly overrated. Not with me it isn't, but there are other ways we can work together, okay? We'll be a good fit.",
        "Bill: Well, if I'm looking for a good fit, I'll go see my tailor. (Laughs) now don't let the door hit you on the way out.",
        "Olivia: You know, I would leave right now if I didn't know how desperately you needed me. (Laughs)",
        "Ross: No, frank, I don't want you to lie. But if Salerno was threatening you or worse yet he was threatening or blackmailing Darci... Come here. Listen to me, if that's what happened any decent attorney could get you out of this with your pension intact.",
        "Frank: I'm not looking for a way out, Ross.",
        "Ross: Frank, you need to think about it.",
        "Frank: No, I don't need to think about it. Do I love Darci? Yes. Do I want to protect her? Yes. Did I turn my back so Salerno could smuggle his drugs into this town? No. Did I steal a non-existent file to hide Darcy's connection to Salerno and green? No.",
        "Harley: Ross, maybe you should just go.",
        "Ross: I have physical evidence and I have a motive. It's now out of my hands. I have to see this through.",
        "Harley: I got something I want to run by you. Do you think Darci has any idea who...",
        "Frank: I want to keep Darci out of this.",
        "Harley: Okay, but if she has an idea, that could be a lead for us to follow.",
        "Frank: I want her to stay out. What next?",
        "Harley: Let's talk about motive. Clearly you were targeted for obvious reasons. Because you wouldn't close the delirium case, because you wanted to tie up all the loose ends.",
        "Frank: You don't have to do this.",
        "Harley: Who stands to gain the most by getting you out of the picture so that you can't ask anymore questions? Not Vinnie Salerno. He's already in Vailsburg. Not brad green. He's dead. So it has to be somebody who's still here who has a vested interest in making this case go away. And that means it has to be somebody named Spaulding.",
        "Jeremy: I told you, Mrs. Spaulding left for the spa.",
        "Gus: Alex. How was the spa? Have a mud bath? Feel refreshed and glowy?",
        "Alexandra: Very funny, very funny. I am running late though, and I'm going to be there for one day. I'll be back tomorrow. We can chat.",
        "Gus: You didn't return my phone calls.",
        "Alexandra: I know and I'm sorry, but we can talk tomorrow.",
        "Gus: No, no, you can't leave like this right before my wedding. You've got things to do. You've got to pick out the right cake. You've got to pick out the right champagne. You've got to pick out the right phony evidence to plant in frank coopers briefcase so you could destroy his life instead of yours. Wait a second, you did that already, didn't you? Coming up on \"guiding light.\"",
        "Gus: It's not good enough for you to get away with something, but you've got to make sure that somebody else takes the fall for you, right?",
        "Alexandra: I had no choice. I didn't have a choice.",
        "Ross: Frank, something's come up.",
        "Harley: They woke up and realized they didn't have a case?",
        "Ross: No, they have a case and it looks like it's iron clad.",
        "Alexandra: All right, Gus, I know you're upset that frank cooper was suspended, but how, and why, do you think I possibly to do with it?",
        "Gus: No, I don't think it. I know it. You had motive, you had an opportunity, and you had means. And as acting chief of police, I think it's time I brought you in. Let's go.",
        "Harley: I've been thinking about it. And what if in the seconds right before he went to meet his makers, when he whispered the words \"god free,\" brad green was trying to name his accomplice.",
        "Frank: But you told me that you spoke to Marie green, and she said that brad green did not have an accomplice.",
        "Harley: Yeah, well, maybe Marie lied. Maybe brad lied to her.",
        "Frank: Harley, come on.",
        "Harley: But if brad green did have an accomplish other than Vinnie Salerno, it had to be somebody at Spaulding.",
        "Frank: Maybe.",
        "Harley: And not just at Spaulding, a Spaulding. Meaning either Alexandra or Alan. My bets on Alex.",
        "Frank: Okay, which is exactly why I want you to stay away from this.",
        "Harley: What? Why?",
        "Frank: Because I have plenty of time now on my suspension to pursue the situation, and I want you to continue to plan your wedding.",
        "Harley: No, no, frank.",
        "Frank: We are talking about Gus' family here, your future in-laws, and I do not want my situation to interfere with your wedding or to come between you and Gus. Do you understand me?",
        "Harley: Frank, it's okay.",
        "Frank: Harley, it is not okay. If Alan or Alexandra are involved here, I will make sure that they regret it. But until then, little sister, I want you to stay out of it.",
        "Alexandra: Gus, if you turn me in now, you will be making one huge mistake. So just stay quiet. Will you get married. Let this investigation take its course, and I assure you by the time you and Harley celebrate your first anniversary, it'll be long forgotten.",
        "Gus: You don't understand, do you? He's going to be my best man at my wedding. The guy's he's my commanding officer and he's my friend. But you don't care about any of that, do you, Mrs. Godfrey?",
        "Alexandra: Oh, keep your voice down. The servants.",
        "Gus: What if he can't pay his mortgage? Did you ever think about that? What if he can't pay marina's tuition? What if he ends up in prison? But you don't care about any of that stuff, because his life means nothing compared to yours, right? The great Alexandra Spaulding. Well, let me tell you something, okay. His life means something to me. Why? Because it means even that much more to the woman that I love. So I am done with you. I am done protecting you, and I'm not going to let you do it to frank cooper.",
        "Frank: I won't let you do this to Gus.",
        "Harley: Gus wants justice done as much as I do.",
        "Frank: Really? And what happens when he finds out that maybe his entire family is involved here? That they're the bad guys. I don't think so.",
        "Harley: When that time comes, if that time comes, Gus will just do what he has to do.",
        "Alexandra: So where do your loyalties lie?",
        "Gus: My loyalties? My loyalties lie with Harley, okay. Before you or Alan or anybody else.",
        "Alexandra: All right then you're absolutely right, Gus. You should tell her the truth. Definitely. You tell her the truth. You tell her how you lied to protect Alan and me. And you tell her how kind you were to warn me that was frank was on trial. He was getting far too close. And he was not going to rest until he brought me down. You tell her how you prodded and pushed and scared me to death until I had no choice except to discredit frank before he destroyed us. And, yes, I mean us, Gus. Because we're co-conspirators. Remember that? You tell her because I'm sure that will sit very well with Harley.",
        "Harley: I don't know if I can do that. I don't know if I can just stay out of it.",
        "Ross: Frank, something's come up.",
        "Harley: Let me guess. IA woke up and realized they didn't have a case?",
        "Ross: No, they have a case and it looks like it's iron clad.",
        "Bill: What are you doing?",
        "Olivia: I'm going to help you.",
        "Bill: Well, I asked you to leave.",
        "Olivia: Yeah, but you didn't mean that.",
        "Bill: No, I meant it.",
        "Olivia: No, you didn't. Look, I'm going to go... One more time. Here's the deal. It's...",
        "Bill: We'd be great together. Yeah, yeah. Blah, blah, blah, blah.",
        "Olivia: Well, we would, you know. And as much you could use a roll in the hay with me, and believe me you could. You've been very uptight these days. I think what you need more right now is a friend. And I need a friend, too, all right? If you haven't noticed, I don't have that many of them.",
        "Bill: Really? Well, you do got a husband?",
        "Olivia: Well, you know, I really prefer to forget that he exists.",
        "Bill: Yet, he does. (Phone rings) oh, I bet you 20 bucks that's him right now.",
        "Olivia: It's a good thing I didn't take that bet. What?",
        "Phillip: Just wanted to see how you're day was going? Whether or not you're keeping up your end of the bargain.",
        "Olivia: I'm having a lovely day. Thank you. I took several thousand breaths, and then I stopped for an ice coffee with two sugars. Any more details you need to know?",
        "Phillip: Just answer the question.",
        "Bill: Take it in the hall.",
        "Phillip: Never mind. I knew you'd come through for me. See you soon.",
        "Olivia: Not if I kill... No see you first. Goodness. Doesn't that sound like a happy marriage? The man is nothing but hideous to me.",
        "Bill: Well, you hurt him.",
        "Olivia: He hurt me first.",
        "Bill: Yeah, well, I feel for you, Olivia. I really, really do. But there's no way I'm getting in the middle of this marriage.",
        "Olivia: It's a failed marriage.",
        "Bill: Whatever it is, I don't care. Just not my scene. You're on your own.",
        "Olivia: Yeah, well, you're on your own. You're already screwing it up. Yeah, nice wall, bill.",
        "Bill: What's wrong with it?",
        "Olivia: What's wrong with it?",
        "Bill: Yeah.",
        "Olivia: Nothing, nothing if you like to hide squirrels behind your wallpaper.",
        "Bill: What are you talking about? That's fine.",
        "Olivia: Oh, it's fine. Yeah, of course it is. Bubbles. Bubbles Lewis. It's a dancer's name.",
        "Bill: Are you talking about this right here? Are you talking about this right here? That's texture.",
        "Olivia: That's not texture. That's Mr. Construction's in way over his head. It's a two man job. It's a two man... You're one man. You're a sloppy man.",
        "Bill: What are you talking about? I am not sloppy.",
        "Olivia: Well, you certainly have an interesting idea about accessorizing.",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, you know, the status on Cassie's identity theft problem is that I have people working on it, Edmund.",
        "Edmund: I thought you said you were handling this personally.",
        "Jeffrey: Edmund, I am the district attorney, okay. I have other cases on my plate besides this one.",
        "Cassie: Okay, well, I'm going to take RJ to Mrs. Chitwood. You guys, behave yourselves, okay.",
        "Edmund: Mr. O'Neill?",
        "Jeffrey: Mm-hmm.",
        "Edmund: The only reason Cass\u00ede has dropped her investigation of this woman is because you told her you would handle it.",
        "Jeffrey: I have handled it.",
        "Edmund: You have? You've found the woman who's been impersonating Cass\u00ede?",
        "Jeffrey: Interpol has informed that they've located her. They're about to make an arrest soon. That is if nobody spooks her first. Notice how I emphasize the word \"if.\"",
        "Edmund: Well, Cass\u00ede has promised me she'd stay out of it.",
        "Jeffrey: (Laughs) and you believe her?",
        "Edmund: Of course, I believe her. I know Cass\u00ede.",
        "Jeffrey: You know Cass\u00ede. Well, you know what? I think I know Cass\u00ede better than you do. Oh, look there's her purse. And I'll bet you anything that's in this purse, that I know her better than you do.",
        "Edmund: My god, man, you can't be serious. You fully expect me to go through Cassie's purse?",
        "Jeffrey: No, I guess not. No, no, I think you should stick your head in the sand. That's the key to a good relationship.",
        "Edmund: If Cass\u00ede says she has given up her investigation of this woman, then Cass\u00ede has given up her investigation of this woman. Besides we both saw her canceling and cut up her credit cards.",
        "Jeffrey: Yes, we did, we saw that. And Edmund you believe what you have to believe, okay.",
        "Edmund: I'm only doing this to wipe the smirk off your face.",
        "Jeffrey: I know. Oh, what's this? Look at this. A little light reading, huh? Hmm.",
        "Cassie: Well, there's no blood on the floor.",
        "Jeffrey: All right, blame me. I totally put him up to this. I'm sorry. Anyway, Edmund, I'm doing my job. You do yours, hmm.",
        "Bill: All right the truth. How long was wallpaper on my butt?",
        "Olivia: Since I walked in. It's really hard to take anything you say seriously. And I do mean anything.",
        "Bill: No, no, no. We're not going there. I told you I'm flying solo these days. In all aspects of my life.",
        "Olivia: Oh. So you've got some trust issues?",
        "Bill: Burn scars from past partnerships.",
        "Olivia: Yeah, me, too. Look third degree.",
        "Bill: Mm.",
        "Olivia: On the hand, we do have to get this room finished. And as much as I think that the paper was cute where it was stuck, that might ruin your credibility in this business. You've got some...",
        "Bill: What?",
        "Olivia: Something on your cheek.",
        "Bill: Oh, yeah?",
        "Olivia: Yeah, it's all over you. It's all down your neck. You know what? I'll paste if you hang.",
        "Bill: I'll tell you what. I'll paste and you hang. (Laughter)",
        "Olivia: Knock yourself out. (Screams)",
        "bill: I...",
        "Olivia: It's okay.",
        "Bill: You could paste.",
        "Gus: You are a piece of work, you know that lady? It's not good enough for you to get away with something, but you've got to make sure that somebody else takes the fall for you, right?",
        "Alexandra: I had no choice. I didn't have a choice. You told me yourself that frank was on the trail, and he was getting closer and closer... closer, and then he wouldn't stop and that trail was going to lead right to you and right to me. Listen, I did this thing as much for you as I did for me.",
        "Gus: You did this thing for yourself and you alone! You know that. And Harley's going to understand that because she's knows exactly what you're capable of.",
        "Alexandra: All right, Gus. All right. You tell her. You go right ahead and tell Harley the truth. Nobody's stopping you.",
        "Ross: This fax just came in. Internal affairs ran a trace on overseas banking transactions. They got a hit on your name.",
        "Frank: What? What are you talking about? Let me see this.",
        "Harley: A million dollars?",
        "Ross: And there's another name on the account. Upper right, page two.",
        "Frank: Brad green?",
        "Ross: Frank, do you see what this looks like?",
        "Harley: Listen to me, listen to me. Do not say a word. Don't say a word until you get yourself a lawyer.",
        "Ross: Your sister's right, yes. In light of what's happened, I now must make your suspension official. Chief copper, would you please put your gun on this table and surrender your badge to me?",
        "Alexandra: If you do tell Harley why you lied, why do you continue to lie, I'm... She's a trusting soul. She's tough. I'm sure she'll forgive you immediately. Really.",
        "Phillip: (Whistling) well, Gus, I didn't know that you were here. Is everything okay?",
        "Gus: I think it's time I go and have a little conversation with Harley.",
        "Phillip: Aunt Alex, what did you do now?",
        "Alexandra: Quite possibly not enough.",
        "Ross: I'm sorry, frank.",
        "Frank: I'm innocent, Ross. And I'm going to prove it.",
        "Dinah: No. No. I don't want those scones with my tea. I want crumpets. (Laughs) no, the tiara's too small for my head. I want some diamonds. I want more diamonds.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay. Are we ready now, Dinah?",
        "Dinah: Okay, like, who am I impersonating, okay? Is it the queen of England? You know what? She's too old. The queen of Sweden. Yeah, she's too cold. I'm the queen of Spain. I have always to have Latin men around me. Can I get my own toreador?",
        "Jeffrey: It's not a queen, Dina, but it is a princess.",
        "Dinah: Right. On a pea who kissed the frog.",
        "Jeffrey: The best part is, you don't even have to do that much research.",
        "Dinah: Okay. Okay, now who is it?",
        "Jeffrey: Her royal highness the princess of san Cristobal, Cassandra Winslow.",
        "Dinah: Never heard of her?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, you might know her better as Cass\u00ede Layne.",
        "Dinah: Cassie Layne? That slutty, cheap tramp married a prince?",
        "Jeffrey: A very handsome one, too.",
        "Dinah: Are you telling me that I am in here and she's out there? (Screams) When do I start? Springfield? \"Springfield's newest luxury hotel, the beacon co-owned by Cass\u00ede Winslow. An all-American success story starring an all- American heroine? The beacon's owner Cass\u00ede Winslow, the former princess, turned a tragedy into a triumph infusing the beacon with her style and grace.\" Yeah, more like a travesty starring a tramp. Success story. Success story. Yeah.",
        "Cassie: You went through my purse, Edmund?",
        "Edmund: Yes, I did. It was wrong, Cass\u00ede, I shouldn't have done it. I'm ashamed of myself. I'm sorry. And that being said, you lied to me. You told me you were going to hand this investigation of the woman over to Jeffrey O'Neill, and you didn't. I find all of that.",
        "Cassie: Okay, fine. You busted me. I kept one credit card so I could keep track of her. And I've been reading about her, too. See?",
        "Edmund: Oh, yes. I saw... I saw that.",
        "Cassie: Edmund, come on. Can you blame me? This woman stole my life.",
        "Edmund: No, Cass\u00ede, she didn't. This is your life. Right here, right now. It's just not enough for you is it?",
        "Cassie: What?",
        "Edmund: What's really upsetting you, Cass\u00ede, is not some woman trotting around Europe pretending to be you. What's upsetting you is there's something missing in your life here in Springfield.",
        "Cassie: That's ridiculous, Edmund.",
        "Edmund: Is it? Is there something missing in your life, Cass\u00ede? Yes or no?",
        "Cassie: Yes.",
        "Gus: Hi.",
        "Harley: Hi. You're home. This whole thing is a nightmare. This is such a nightmare.",
        "Gus: What is?",
        "Harley: Listen to this. Whoever setting up frank, they set up a Swiss bank account with $1 million in it in frank's name.",
        "Gus: Wow.",
        "Harley: In frank's name. And then Ross took away his badge and his gun in front of everybody, in front of the whole department. All the guys. Murphy and Caruso and Rodriguez.",
        "Gus: All right, listen to me.",
        "Harley: All right, why don't you just rip the guy's heart out? You're humiliating him in front of everyone. We have to figure this out. We have to figure who is doing this to him.",
        "Gus: Can you just listen to me? There's something I have to tell you.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Alan: Gus protected you. He will continue to protect you, Alexandra.",
        "Alexandra: He was just here, and he made it perfectly clear where his loyalties lie... With Harley.",
        "Gus: I can't marry you. I can't marry until I come clean with something."
