        "Alan Spaulding \u0096 In the Light \"Saving Grace\"",
        "Alan thinks about the lost baby. He tells Lillian at the hospital that he wants to take Beth home. At the mansion, he looks through the baby book, Roxie irritating him by nuzzling him. He takes Beth home and tells her that Dr. Sedgwick said they could try again for another baby very soon. She slaps him and leaves. A despondent Alan goes to Outskirts and starts drinking. He staggers into Company and frightens Zach; tries to talk to Lizzie and Coop asks him to leave. Buzz has to man handle him to get him to leave, telling Alan that he messed up his families' lives. Alan visits the church and talks to Father Ray, telling him that he is being punished. Ray tries to tell him that G-d doesn't punish and Alan realizes he needs to be more spiritual. Alan- Michael arrives and taunts Alan for being in church. Alan goes back to the mansion and talks to Alexandra who is looking for Phillip. She tells Alan he doesn't look well. A delivery arrives and it is a nursery box Alan ordered for the baby. He becomes irate and tells Roxie that he doesn't like little dogs for they remind him of children. He crashes the wooden box to pieces on the floor and suddenly collapses gasping and writhing on the floor. Alan tries to call Beth, Lizzie and Alan-Michael for help and they all ignore him save Roxie who is by his head the entire time. The ambulance takes him to Cedars and he is told he had a panic attack. Beth tells him that she will stay in their \"arrangement\". Alan has flashbacks of Phillip telling Alan to help him. He has another conversation with Buzz who tells Alan he must let his children be themselves and place the past in the past. Alan tells Ray that he has figured out what his redemption is; Lizzie's baby. He tells Ray, as he rubs Lizzie's stomach, that nothing will ever harm him (the baby)."

        "Lillian: You leave my daughter alone.",
        "Alan: Lillian, I understand how you might be feeling, especially since you found out what happened between phillip and me.",
        "Lillian: What happened between phillip and you-- you make it sound so casual.",
        "Alan: I can assure you it is anything but casual, but all that aside, the only thing I'm concerned about right now is beth and the loss of our child. Now I understand she is going to be released today.",
        "Lillian: Yes.",
        "Alan: Well I want to take her home.",
        "Lillian: No.",
        "Alan: I want to help her.",
        "Lillian: You are not taking her home. Now I understand how upset you are about this baby. I know it must be very painful for you, alan.",
        "Alan: Thank you. That baby was your grandchild, lillian, but these things happen in life. And I always pride myself in being prepared for any possibility that life may throw at you. Never get too invested in stocks, securities, futures, people, people's futures. Get out of here. I don't like small dogs. Shoo! Hush, little baby, don't say a word daddy's going to buy you a mockingbird and if that mockingbird don't sing daddy's going to buy you a diamond ring if that diamond ring don'tdo shine... it's not like the baby was born and then we lost it. We never had a chance to know it. That's a good thing. I've learned not to mourn over things I can't control. I want you to come with me, beth. I have a little special surprise for you. I called ahead and had room service prepare your favorite.",
        "Beth: You're not listening to me.",
        "Alan: I want tonight to be a very special evening for us.",
        "Beth: Special?",
        "Alan: Yes.",

        "Alan: After what you've lost, beth...",
        "Beth: Stop, stop, stop talking!",
        "Alan: Beth. Beth, look. I realize that there is nothing I can do to make you feel anything that you don't want to feel. But I don't think it's over for us.",
        "Beth: Us?",
        "Alan: Yes, our dreams, our baby, our future together--r-",
        "Beth: Our baby died, alan. Do you understand what that means?",
        "Alan: It was just a temporary setback, that is all.",
        "Beth: You're insane, you know that?",
        "Alan: I talked with dr. Sedwick, and she said in two or three months we can start having a family again. And by the summer, you and I-- hush, little baby, don't say a word daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird and if that mockingbird don't sing daddy's gonna buy you... captioning sponsored by procter & gamble productions, inc.

        "Jonathan: We're closed. Oh, easy. Don't want you to have a heart attack.",
        "Alan: What happened to your door?",
        "Jonathan: Well, it looks like somebody broke in.",
        "Alan: I decided to help myself.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. You're in luck, we're having a special today. Billionaires drink free, millionaires and thousandaires hit the road. Bill gates should be stopping by later-- oprah. You look like you could use her shoulder to cry on.",
        "Alan: Show some respect.",
        "Jonathan: You've got to earn respect with me, big al. You don't buy it with money.",
        "Alan: A punk with scrupples. That's the first and only I've ever liked about you.",
        "Jonathan: Ooh. Does mean we're dating?",
        "Alan: Tell me why there's no one here?",
        "Jonathan: It's closed by order of the D.A.",
        "Alan: Oh. How much do I owe you for the drink?",
        "Jonathan: $200. Well, I see you're drinking with a lot of your friends. Does this briefcase have...",
        "Alan: Elizabeth, I'm so glad that you're here, so I can--",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, okay. I can't talk to you right now, granddad.",
        "Alan: I can imagine you don't want to talk to me because the last time I saw you, I said some very hurtful things--",
        "Lizzie: Have you been drinking?",
        "Alan: I'm okay. Lizzie:( Gasps )",
        "Alan: Look, I know you don't want to see me, elizabeth, but i wonder if you knew I was just with your mother.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, I know. She called me.",
        "Alan: I would appreciate it if you could--",
        "Lizzie: Talk to her? You want me to talk to her? Is that what you want?",
        "Alan: Yes, I think it would help her understand--",
        "Lizzie: No one cares, granddad. Don't you get that? This time it was too much.",
        "Alan: I want to show you something. I want to show you something I've been putting together here, elizabeth. Something--",
        "Coop: I think that you should leave, alan.",
        "Alan: Henry, I want to show elizabeth something, so if you don't mind.",
        "Coop: How much did you have to drink?",
        "Alan: I'm fine. Look, we have a little business here. Just please excuse us for a few minutes.",
        "Coop: No, you don'T.",
        "Alan: Listen, don't-- don't you lecture her me, do you understand? I am her grandfather; you are a nobody--",
        "Coop: Excuse me, I'm the father of her child! And she said she doesn't want to see you. Come on, elizabeth.",
        "Alan: Hey, zach.",
        "Buzz: Not now. Not now, not now.",
        "Alan: What do you mean not now? He's my grandson! Come on.",
        "Buzz: Hey, you want fight? You want to fight, I'll pound you down to the ground.",
        "Alan: Look, I want you to--",
        "Buzz: Hey, listen to me. You sent my daughter to prison because your son was supposed to have been dead and he was alive. You slammed my family, including your grandson. You did that, and that's just the tip of the iceberg. Do you know that? You lost your baby. I understand. I wouldn't wish that on anyone, not even you. But you need to go. You need to go.",
        "Alan: I need to go. I have to go, buzz, but you get to stay. You get to stay with zach and elizabeth. I have to go.",
        "Father ray: Mr. Spaulding?",
        "Alan: Never mind, this is a mistake, I should not be here.",
        "Father ray: And yet here you are.",
        "Alan: Is that supposed to be some kind of divine message?",
        "Father ray: I'm just stating facts.",
        "Alan: I've got a fact for you: I'm not a religious man, I'm not anything.",
        "Father ray: These doors are open to all, sir.",
        "Alan: All right. I've got a question for you, father: How does one save ones self when god has decided to punish you?",
        "Father ray: Bad things happen to everybody, mr. Spaulding. That doesn't necessarily mean it is god's way of punishing people; that's just life.",
        "Alan: Are you telling me i just have to deal with it?",
        "Father ray: With god's help, if you like. Life is a human journey, and the journey can be more fulfilling if you open your heart to spiritual understanding.",
        "Alan: So I need to be more spiritual and less human, huh? Okay, I get it. I get it. Look, I know all of this sounds a little paranoid and delusional.",
        "Father ray: No. We're all worried about retribution in one form or another. We all have to deal with guilt. It's when that guilt becomes too overwhelming that we have to believe that the scales have to balance themselves somehow. At some point, well, we end up here.",
        "Alan: Well, father, here i am. You see, I... I was going to have a new child, a boy. He was going to be my new beginning, my new start, my hope.",
        "Father ray: He was your salvation. Alan, I know you've done some terrible things in your life, to your family, to your children.",
        "Alan: Especially my children.",
        "Father ray: It's those we love we hurt the most. And you have chosen to bully those you love.",
        "Beth: You've bullied me for the last time, alan.",
        "Lizzie: I am so happy that my baby is going to grow up with coop as its father. Maybe that will keep it from being as screwed up as the rest of the family.",
        "Alan: You will be as hated as I am.",
        "Alan-michael: That will never happen.",
        "Gus: Can't you be yourself, for once? Alan spaulding, do you even know who that is? Just for once in your life, be alan spaulding!",
        "Alan: I didn't mean to kill him. He was my son.",
        "Alexandra: He was a better man than you, alan. He didn't go under the guise of some grieving father like you!",
        "Father ray: Under the guise of a grieving father. There's a difference between retribution and atonement. God doesn't want to punish you. He wants you to atone. He wants you to fix your own mess. He'll help you along the way. But he's not going to punish you if you fall.",
        "Alan: A just and caring god, huh? Who knew? You see, my father tortured me and my sister our entire lives. He caused us so much pain and hurt. As a grown man, it's been hard for me to shake all of that off. It's made me want to hurt people. My father was a monster. When he died, he died all alone with no one. I drove them away. Every one I cared about, I drove them away.",
        "Father ray: Are you okay?",
        "Alan: Yes, father. I just need to catch my breath. That's all. You see, I'll never get them back. That's why I was so hoping that this new child could be my fresh start. He was my last chance.",
        "Alan-michael: Alan spaulding in a house of god. Don't stand too close, father. Lightning is going to strike him down any minute now.",
        "Alan: Alan-michael, I was here making arrangements for the boy I lost. Now, do you have any more jokes?",
        "Alan-michael: No, I'm sorry.",
        "Alan: Look, don't pretend that you care. You see what I mean, father?",
        "Father ray: There's always hope, alan. You just have to want it more than your pain.",
        "Alan: Well, forget about it, because all I know is pain.",
        "Alexandra: Well, you finally slowed down long enough to say hello.",
        "Alan: What?",
        "Alexandra: Look at you, you've been running every place, your tie's undone.",
        "Alan: Because I've been busy, alexandra!",
        "Alexandra: And I've been looking for you. As a matter of fact, I've sent out feelers all over the world for phillip. You know, what you did is absolutely unconscionable, alan.",
        "Alan: Really? As if I didn't know.",
        "Alexandra: I would like to give you a good tongue lashing, but you don't look well. And I think you really are suffering.",
        "Alan: Thank you for your concern.",
        "Alexandra: And we spauldings do know how we suffer in silence, don't we?",
        "Alan: Alexandra...",
        "Alexandra: Oh, never mind.",
        "Alan: Alexandra, do you remember our father's funeral?",
        "Alexandra: ( Laughs ) that is a very strange question to ask me.",
        "Alan: I've been thinking a lot about it?",
        "Alexandra: Yes, of course, i worry taffetta and velvet, and i had a white flower in my hair, and there wasn't a red eye and the crowd.",
        "Alan: Because no one wanted to be there.",
        "Alexandra: Especially not us, huh? Unless of course it would have been to dance on his grave.",
        "Alan: You told me that they gave me a memorial service when they thought I died...",
        "Alexandra: Alan, alan, alan, I don't think we ought to go there.",
        "Alan: What was it like when uh...",
        "Man: Excuse me, this was just delivered.",
        "Alexandra: Well, it looks like something for the nursery, I'll have them send it back.",
        "Alan: No, no. You can't send it back. I had it custom designed.",
        "Alexandra: Alan, please, come on. Don't do this to yourself.",
        "Alan: No, no.",
        "Alexandra: Leave whatever is in the box in the box.",
        "Alan: Alexandra, if you don't mind, excuse me, because I have some work to do.",
        "Alexandra: Oh. ( Laughing )",
        "Alan: There. Phillip, I should have done this for you and alan-michael, too. Why did it take me so long to realize or assume the important. What are you doing? Why are you looking at me like that? Listen, come here. Didn't I tell you... didn't i tell you that I didn't like little dogs, huh? You know why? Because little dogs are like children. They can't do anything without their parents. They can't feed themselves. That's why I'm better off without my child. I'm better off without him. ( Gasping ) oh. Oh, my god! Oh, oh.",
        "Alan: ( Gaspsing ) oh! Ah! Oh, god! 911. Oh, this it's spaulding. Help-- help me. Beth! Beth! ( Cell phone rings )",
        "Beth: It's alan. ( Cell phone rings )",
        "Lizzie: You want to finish the job.",
        "Coop: No thank you, I will leave you two alone.",
        "Alan: Please, please, someone, please! ( Cell phone rings )",
        "Alan: I tried. No one cares.",
        "Beth: This is beth, leave a message.",
        "Alan: Beth! Beth. I know I don't have much time to call everyone. So I want you to take a message for me to my family, to my children. Things aren't going so good right now. So, please, please tell them that I love them. Tell them that I love them.",
        "Emt: Someone called 9-1-1. Are you sure it's mr. Spaulding? He was fine the last I saw him.",
        "Alan: In here! I'm in here! Please, in here!",
        "Doctor: The bp is 160 over 90. Pulse at 64.",
        "Lillian: Alan, it's lillian. You're at cedars. Everything's going to be all right? Can you hear me?",
        "Alan: Lillian, no one cared. No one cared.",
        "Lillian: Maybe not, but it's your lucky day because we are paid to take care of everyone who comes in here.",
        "Alan: Father, pray.",
        "Lillian: Alan, you don't have to speak. If it's too painful, I have your chart.",
        "Doctor: You have a history of heart disease, mr. Spaulding?",
        "Father ray: Alan, did you call me in here to give you last rites?",
        "Lillian: We're not going to give you up without a fight, alan.",
        "Alan: Lillian, I don't think I have that much time left. I want you to understand one thing: That baby meant everything to me.",
        "Lillian: I know.",
        "Doctor: All right, we're just going to fire up the monitors, mr. Spaulding.",
        "Lillian: That means that the doctor is going to get a better handle of what's going on, alan.",
        "Doctor: So far your heart sounds fine.",
        "Alan: What's going on?",
        "Lillian: Well you had shortness of breath and tightness of the chest, didn't you?",
        "Doctor: You're not dying, mr. Spaulding.",
        "Lillian: No, I think you were having a panic attack. Panic attacks are brought on by stress.",
        "Alan: I was upset. I mean dr. Wills, I'm not dying?",
        "Doctor: Not today.",
        "Lillian: I think we're going to have you around for a lot longer. Lucky us. Here's today's today time dollars official winning code number. For your chance to win cash and prizes, register today at daytimedollars.Com, and keep watching for more chances to win. Good luck.",
        "Beth: My mother called when you were in route to the hospital. I'm glad you're not dead.",
        "Alan: Well, I suppose that's progress.",
        "Beth: I don't forgive you for anything. What you did with phillip goes beyond lying. And then we were supposed to what, go out, have dinner and drinks and discuss what we lost. Talk about replacing a child.",
        "Alan: Beth, it was only an idea just to maybe help us reconnect. That's all.",
        "Beth: Do you understand what you've lost? No, no, of course you don't because you don't appreciate what you've got. And you know why? Because you've got a big hole right here, and nothing will ever be beautiful enough or precious enough to fill it up.",
        "Alan: Our baby would have been big enough to fill it up.",
        "Beth: ( Laughs ) you don't think I'd be fool enough to believe that, do you? That baby was just another feather in your cap.",
        "Alan: That baby was my future, my lifeline.",
        "Beth: Oh, right. Well let's get down to business, huh? That's something you understand. You see, there are still things I want in this world, and as sad as I am, and as angry as I am, I'm not going to walk away from this arrangement.",
        "Alan: Arrangement? You mean our marriage?",
        "Beth: I mean our arrangement, before our feelings got in the way.",
        "Alan: I'm not sure I can go back.",
        "Beth: Well, you're going to have to. Because I'm going to get what i want, especially now. I'll see you at home.",
        "Alan: Before there were feelings, huh?",
        "Alan-michael: You all done praying?",
        "Alan: I bet you're wondering why I called you.",
        "Alan-michael: You got my attention. Our cards are on the table. I know that phillip is out there somewhere, and you know that i don't want him coming back. Competition for the top slot at spaulding is tough enough as it is.",
        "Alan: Well, then let's cut to it.",
        "Alan-michael: I know you lost a child, dad, an heir. I am sorry.",
        "Alan: Well, I accept your apology then.",
        "Alan-michael: Then let's be honest here. You would never even had lived to see the new kid take over spaulding.",
        "Alan: What's your point?",
        "Alan-michael: Let's go with the facts: Aunt alex, she's tired and scared. Your wife, she despises you, and you can bet she's going to make your life a living hell. She doesn't have phillip to protect her, and so she's got to stand up for herself. And she's tougher than any of us expected.",
        "Alan: Lk,ou't he to try to impress me with all ofthesfas-",
        "Alan-michael: Anybody else you had in mind hates you because of phillip. So once again, you're left with nothing and no one. Except me.",
        "Alan: I would never assume i had you, either.",
        "Alan-michael: That is why we're here, isn't it? You're hoping that I'll be your partner in crime, to force out harley from spaulding.",
        "Alan: No, son. I gave up on that pursuit a while ago. You see, alan-michael, when beth became pregnant, I wanted things to be different. I wanted another chance this time.",
        "Alan-michael: What you wanted was a new heir for spaulding. But let's face it, you would have just become obsessed with the company again, and you would have ignored the new kid, too.",
        "Alan: No, no, no, not this time.",
        "Alan-michael: Forgive me-- forgive me if I don't believe that. And even if you were able to turn over a new leaf, it's too little, too late.",
        "Alan: Maybe it is for you. But not for the baby.",
        "Alan-michael: And then what? He'd end up like phillip. You loved him, didn't you? You did everything you could to make him the best spaulding he could be, and we all know what happened there. Alan, your children are gone. We're all gone.",
        "Alan: You have become the man that I've always wanted you to be.",
        "Phillip: Everything that I'm doing is for my children's future.",
        "Alan: So you did all of this to protect elizabeth?",
        "Phillip: He could use it to destroy us all.",
        "Alan: What can I do to help?",
        "Phillip: Just be there for her, okay? No matter what happens.",
        "Alan: We all thought you were crazy, son. But you had one thing right: Never let them take your children. Never let them turn your children against you. Children and grandchildren are everything. Always keep them close and make them stay, even if you have to use force. I need your help!",
        "Alan: Look at you, buzz, just look at you.",
        "Buzz: I have the feeling i don't like where this is going. I really have enjoyed our visit up until... what is the point?",
        "Alan: You have been a screw-up, that's what the point is.",
        "Buzz: Is this where you're going to flatter me now?",
        "Alan: You're children, your grandchildren have all forgiven you. They think you walk on water. You weren't even here for a decade or two, you disappeared!",
        "Buzz: And yet here I am. After all these years, here i am. And you wonder why my kids would take the bullet for me.",
        "Alan: Yes, I do. Tell me.",
        "Buzz: Because I wouldn't put the bullet in them first. You can't put the bullet in them.",
        "Alan: You trying to be funny, buzz?",
        "Buzz: I am. No, I wasn't trying to be funny. I didn't mean it literally, trying to shoot your kids, you know. You wonder why I have a chance in my kids' lives?",
        "Alan: Yes, I do.",
        "Buzz: Because I earned it. I earned it. I put my ego in the drawer. Never letting go means letting go of the reins. Let go of the reins and enjoy the ride. Do you understand what I'm saying to you? You can't steer the ship all the time.",
        "Alan: If I don't steer the ship, it will sink.",
        "Buzz: Oh, 'ye of little faith. Redemption isn't about today. It's about tomorrow. And the next day and the next day. Being part of your family's lives means putting the past behind.",
        "Alan: Then what?",
        "Buzz: You grab on and cling to them. Than me healy.",
        "Alan: So I accept them the way they are, and move on from there?",
        "Buzz: You see them for who they truly are. You have to do that. Because when you don't, you know what happens.",
        "Lizzie: Hi.",
        "Alan: Oh, I thought we were alone.",
        "Lizzie: I can leave if you want.",
        "Alan: No, no, no, that's all right. That's all right, isn't it?",
        "Lizzie: I just came to pick up roxy.",
        "Alan: Here, here you go.Heou goy",
        "Lizzie: I, um... heard what happened. Are you okay?",
        "Alan: Oh, yeah. M ne. Itas rthin therilactuly >Izzit's no you never let on how upset you were about the baby. And then you just kind of lost it.",
        "Alan: Yeah, I guess you're right.",
        "Lizzie: Can I ask you something? What was it like, the panic attacks?",
