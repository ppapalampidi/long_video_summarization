        "Ridge tells Brooke that he hates seeing her this way. Bill is just playing with her emotions. She needs to tell him it is over for good. Bill tells Brooke they are far from over. He never meant to hurt Ridge, just teach him a lesson. Ridge tells Brooke again to cut him loose. He's not worth it; never was. Bill defends himself by saying he used all his resources to find Ridge. Katie speaks up and says he made Ridge doubt himself and made them doubt him too and that's the worst of it. Bill asks Brooke for five minutes alone and then he will leave if she still wants him to. Brooke tells Ridge and Katie to go on home, she will be okay. Bill thanks Brooke for giving him this time. She says don't; he has no idea what she is going to say. Liam joins Hope and Wyatt on the Rooftop and asks what is going on. Before Hope can say a word, she is tracked down and told she is needed back inside. Ivy shows Aly the video she made that accidentally caught Hope hugging Wyatt. She says she feels terrible. She is not this kind of person. Aly is shocked. She says Hope is back with Liam and she would never put him through that. Ivy has no other explanation then why Hope is hugging Wyatt unless he gave her the diamond. She saw the hug and the way Hope looked at him. Liam asks Wyatt how it is going with Ivy. Wyatt says he has noticed how cute she is but no office romance. That usually doesn't work out. Hope is taking longer than Liam thought so he says he is going to track her down. Wyatt tells him fine go be with his lady. Under his breath he says while he till can.",
        "As Hope finishes up, Deacon drops in and says he can't stay away from his beautiful daughter. He finds that she is distracted. He says he knows his track record really sucks at being a dad but he's trying to change that. He encourages her to tell him what's on her mind. Slowly she tells him something very unexpected happened. It involves the HFTF diamond. Deacon says he knows about the power of the diamond and Wyatt showed it to him. It's everything they all say it is and a lot more. She brings it out of her pocket and says Wyatt promised her that he would give it to her some day but now that he has .Deacon is shocked to hear that he actually gave it to her and encourages Hope to keep it. They banter back and forth how appropriate it is and Hope says not for an engaged woman to accept a diamond from another man. Suddenly they are interrupted by Katie and Ridge. Katie explains that Ridge took Bill on a little helicopter ride. Deacon hopes he sang like a bird. Ridge says eventually he did. Hope is surprised of course that Ridge can even fly a chopper. Deacon wants to know how Brooke is. Surely she has kicked Bill to the curb. Ridge says not yet and it worries him. Brooke won't let Bill touch her. She says she thought she knew the man she was about to marry today. He valued family above everything else even business. So he could not have done those things that Ridge said he did. She knows in the past that he has done some questionable things, hurtful things but she never knew he could be so intentionally cruel. Perhaps even a murderer Bill says he is no murderer. Brooke bellows then he's a damn liar. They all stood there in that suite scared to death for Ridge and Bill stood there and acted like he knew nothing. He says he was wrong. He does love her more than anything in this world. He says he let this consume him but he will never keep anything from her again. He begs her to please not let this derail their plans. Say she will understand and forgive. Finally she says she will search her heart for forgiveness but this reckless anger that he has she can not take it. She can not possibly marry him now or anytime soon. She says he lied tot her and betrayed her. He says they can not let this or anything tear them apart. Aly tells Ivy that Wyatt should not be upping the stakes. Hope has made her choice and it is Liam that she wants. Wyatt is just using the diamond to get Hope back. Hope looks at the diamond fondly and is still looking when Liam hobbles in. She doesn't hide it. She brings it out and shows him and says Wyatt gave it to her. Liam thinks it is a replica until she says no, that Ricardo passed away and willed the original to Wyatt and now he has given it to her. Liam says damnit, damnit, damnit, Wyatt lucked out and he's already using it to his advantage. He should have anticipated this. He says she knows she can't keep it. She has to give it back, like today."

        "Ridge: He's saying what he thinks you want to hear. He's playing with your emotions.",
        "Bill: That's not what I'm doing.",
        "Ridge: I hate seeing you like that. It's over. Tell him it's over for good.",
        "Liam: So what's going on?",
        "Wyatt: Oh, you know. The yuzh.",
        "Liam: \"The yuzh\"? You want to let me in -- Ms. Logan? Excuse me. I've been looking for you.",
        "Hope: Oh, what's wrong? We have a mutiny on our hands. Come quickly.",
        "Hope: Okay. I'm gonna go see what this is about.",
        "Liam: Yeah, probably.",
        "Hope: Okay.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles] Mutiny?",
        "Wyatt: Aha.",
        "Ivy: It was an accident. I didn't mean to capture any of this on video.",
        "Aly: You shot this?",
        "Ivy: Yeah, I was making a video tour of Forrester for my mum. Not in a million years did I expect to find hope and Wyatt. I feel terrible. I'm not this kind of person.",
        "Aly: The way she's looking at Wyatt -- but she's back with Liam now. Hope would never -- she would never put Liam through that. Shall I let the sewers know it's being addressed?",
        "Hope: Absolutely, and thank you so much for alerting me about this. I will rework the schedule. Okay.",
        "Hope: Okay. [Sighs]",
        "Deacon: [Chuckles] Am I being a pest?",
        "Hope: Deacon, hey.",
        "Deacon: Just can't seem to stay away from my beautiful daughter.",
        "Ivy: This has got to stay between us, okay?",
        "Aly: Okay.",
        "Ivy: Good.",
        "Aly: What do you know that I don't.",
        "Ivy: Do you remember the Hope for the Future diamond?",
        "Aly: Um, of course.",
        "Ivy: Guess who owns it now?",
        "Aly: Se\u00f1or Montemayor sold it?",
        "Ivy: No. No, he died.",
        "Aly: Oh, my gosh. Does hope know?",
        "Ivy: She does now. And apparently he willed the diamond to Wyatt.",
        "Aly: What?",
        "Ivy: Wyatt owns the diamond.",
        "Aly: I don't get it. Why would he give something that huge to Wyatt? It's not like Wyatt is family.",
        "Ivy: All I know is that Wyatt showed it to me right before he gave it to hope.",
        "Aly: You know what he's up to, right? He is using that diamond to try to get hope again. And right after Liam and hope allowed him to come back to Forrester. This is unbelievable.",
        "Ivy: Don't think it's fair to blame all of this on Wyatt. From what I saw, hope isn't entirely blameless in all of this, either.",
        "Wyatt: [Clears throat]",
        "Liam: So, how's it going with you and Ivy?",
        "Wyatt: You mean have I noticed how cute she is?",
        "Liam: Apparently you have.",
        "Wyatt: Well, a guy would have to be blind not to.",
        "Liam: Uh, yeah. Is there a, uh -- is there a \"but\" coming?",
        "Wyatt: Well, office romances seldom work, unless...",
        "Liam: Unless, you know... dude. What's going on with you?",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] Um...",
        "Deacon: Hope, you seem a little preoccupied. Is everything okay?",
        "Hope: With work, yeah. Good.",
        "Deacon: With work, with your personal life? Look, I know that my track record as a dad sucks, but I really am trying to change that. Or I could just leave.",
        "Hope: No. No. Good. Stay. I'm -- I'm glad you're here. [Sighs] So... something very unexpected happened, and, I mean, I guess I shouldn't have been surprised, because he told me he was gonna give it to me, but now that he has, I'm -- I'm just -- I -- I'm not making any sense to you right now, am I?",
        "Deacon: No.",
        "Hope: Yeah.",
        "Bill: It's not over, Brooke.",
        "Ridge: It was over the second you told Justin to dump me in the gulf.",
        "Bill: As payback for the cheap shot you laid on me for dragging my bride away. Not as a way to eliminate you from our lives.",
        "Katie: You keep saying that, but it's just words.",
        "Bill: Because it's the truth! I wanted to teach him a lesson, not have him killed.",
        "Ridge: Don't listen to him, Brooke. Cut him loose. Spencer is not worth it. Never was.",
        "Liam: Well, I know you're really happy to be back. I mean, could Ivy be part of the reason?",
        "Wyatt: [Laughing] Wow.",
        "Liam: What?",
        "Wyatt: Bro, come on.",
        "Liam: What?",
        "Wyatt: You are getting way ahead of yourself here.",
        "Liam: I'm just --",
        "Wyatt: I am not in the market for a -- a diamond, and if I were, it would have to be perfect in every single way.",
        "Liam: Like the Hope for the Future diamond?",
        "Wyatt: There's only one of those. And to say that she's that exquisite.",
        "Liam: [Laughs] Diamonds have genders now, apparently.",
        "Wyatt: Rare gems are like rare women. When you find one, you just can't -- I'm not telling you something you don't already know.",
        "Liam: Speaking of hope, you don't think there's really a --",
        "Wyatt: A mutiny happening and the inmates are taking over?",
        "Liam: Yeah.",
        "Wyatt: I don't know.",
        "[Both laugh]",
        "Hope: Well, keep me posted, okay? It's very important that the sewers' concerns are addressed. Okay. Thank you. Sorry about that.",
        "Deacon: No, not at all. My daughter is a very important businesswoman, who apparently has a lot going on in her personal life, too.",
        "Hope: Mm. [Sighs] Have you heard of the Hope for the Future diamond?",
        "Deacon: Yeah, of course I have. I mean, it was all over the press. You and Wyatt jetting down to Mexico -- sure.",
        "Hope: Yeah. Yeah, that was the start of a lot of really incredible adventures for us. It seemed like each one was more exciting than the next. In a sense.",
        "Deacon: I guess the diamond lived up to its rep, right? Worked its magic on you and Wyatt.",
        "Hope: Yeah. Yeah, you know about that?",
        "Deacon: Yeah, I mean, Wyatt told me about the power of the diamond when he showed it to me.",
        "Hope: You've seen it?",
        "Deacon: Yeah. Oh, yeah. And, baby, I got to tell you something. It is everything that you and he said it is and a whole lot more.",
        "Bill: I never wanted what happened to happen. And when Ridge when missing, I used all my resources to help find him. And I was worried, too.",
        "Ridge: You were worried about being tried for murder. That was your only concern.",
        "Bill: Look at me. I should have told you the truth.",
        "Ridge: But you didn't.",
        "Bill: I kept thinking that Forrester was gonna show up and everything was gonna be okay.",
        "Katie: But he wasn't okay, Bill. He wasn't okay. Yes, he made it to shore, but he's still been struggling. And all you've done is belittle him. You made him think that what he was remembering isn't what happened, but it is what happened. You made him doubt himself, and, worst of all, you made us doubt him. I think that's the most despicable part of this.",
        "Ridge: Brooke... I want what's best for you. And what's best for our son.",
        "Brooke: I was hoping that you and I could raise will and R.J. Together, that the four of us could live in peace together for the sake of the children. In peace, Bill.",
        "Bill: That can still happen.",
        "Ridge: Oh, Spencer, get out.",
        "Bill: Please, just give me -- just give me five minutes. The two of us alone, okay? And if you still want me out after that, fine.",
        "Brooke: I'll be fine. Really. You two should go home.",
        "Katie: Okay. Well, call us if you need anything.",
        "Brooke: I will.",
        "Bill: Thank you for giving us a moment.",
        "Brooke: Don't. Don't thank me, Bill. You have no idea what I'm going to say.",
        "Ivy: Look, don't get me wrong. I like hope. But why is she playing these guys, if she's playing them?",
        "Aly: Did hope accept the diamond?",
        "Ivy: I'm not even entirely sure that Wyatt gave it to her. But if he did, what do you think? Do you think it's appropriate to accept a gift from your ex- boyfriend, especially a gift like that.",
        "Aly: Of course not, and hope knows that. Plus she'd never upset Liam by accepting it.",
        "Ivy: Okay, well, it still doesn't explain the embrace and the way she was looking at him. Or does it?",
        "Liam: Well, brother. Fun as this is...",
        "Wyatt: I know. I am a terrible substitute for hope. Go.",
        "Liam: It's not your fault. I'm gonna go track her down. Anything -- any message you want me to give her?",
        "Wyatt: No, no. I'm cool. Go spend some time with your lady. While you still can.",
        "Deacon: I'm guessing Wyatt has shown it to you.",
        "Hope: Wyatt's always saying these crazy, romantic things, like he's going to give this to me one day, but now that he actually has --",
        "Deacon: Wait, wait. Wyatt gave this to you?",
        "Hope: Yeah, but I -- I can't really keep it, can I?",
        "Deacon: Are you kidding me? Are you my daughter? Hell, yeah, you can keep it. You take that thing and you go running through the streets screaming.",
        "Hope: [Laughs]",
        "Deacon: Do you have any idea what this thing is worth?",
        "Hope: Oh, I don't know. I don't think anybody really knows, but if I did keep it --",
        "Deacon: Think about this for a second, all right? Just think about the tie-ins to your line. I mean, it's got amazing promotional value.",
        "Hope: I know, so Wyatt has reminded me. Although, when that's over, I would have to give it back.",
        "Deacon: Why?",
        "Hope: Well, for starters, it's kind of inappropriate for an engaged woman to accept a diamond from another man. [Sighs]",
        "Ridge: I think we should have stayed.",
        "Katie: Ridge --",
        "Ridge: Hey.",
        "Hope: Hey. What's going on?",
        "Deacon: You did it, didn't you? You confronted Spencer and he sang like a bird.",
        "Ridge: Eventually, yeah.",
        "Hope: What are you talking about? What's happening?",
        "Katie: Ridge took Bill on a little helicopter ride.",
        "Ridge: Only he thought that Justin was flying.",
        "Hope: You are not a pilot.",
        "Ridge: Mm, I am. Took lessons in Paris.",
        "Deacon: Okay, so, what happened after you made your big reveal? What did he say?",
        "Katie: He denied everything, of course.",
        "Ridge: Until I bounced him around a little bit.",
        "Hope: Oh, my god.",
        "Katie: I mean, none of this would have happened if you didn't find out that Bill's helicopter was in Abu Dhabi.",
        "Hope: Wait, what? I don't -- what?",
        "Deacon: It's a long story.",
        "Ridge: It was Bill all along. Justin was flying that day, and Spencer made him dump me in the drink.",
        "Deacon: Look, how's Brooke doing, all right? Oh, please tell me that she has kicked Spencer to the curb.",
        "Ridge: Not yet. That's what worries me.",
        "Deacon: [Sighs]",
        "Bill: Brooke.",
        "Brooke: Don't. [Sighs] I thought I knew the man that I was about to marry today. A man who fought so hard to spend more time with his little son. A man who claims that he valued family over anything else, even business. I really didn't think it was possible that you could do those things that Ridge said you did. I know in the past you've done things that are questionable. Hurtful things. But I never knew that you could be intentionally cruel. God forbid, even a murderer.",
        "Bill: I'm not a murderer.",
        "Brooke: Okay, then you're a liar. You're a damn liar! We stood there, Bill, in that suite, all of us, wondering what happened to Ridge, scared to death. And you stood there and you acted like you knew nothing. Who was flying that helicopter, who was responsible, what happened to Ridge -- you said nothing! And to claim that you love me more than anything in this world.",
        "Bill: I do love you more than anything in this world. And I was wrong.",
        "Brooke: Wrong? Wrong? You were heartless. You were cruel!",
        "Bill: I let my anger at Ridge destroying our wedding, taking you from me -- I let it consume me. I will never keep anything from you again.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs]",
        "Bill: Please don't let this derail our plans. Say you'll try and understand... and forgive.",
        "Brooke: Uh... I... [Scoffs] I am going to search my heart for forgiveness. But this -- this reckless anger that you have, I can't take it.",
        "Deacon: That's a hell of a story. So what happens now? You send the cops over to Brooke's?",
        "Ridge: No, no cops.",
        "Deacon: Are you telling me after all this, you're not going to prosecute Spencer?",
        "Ridge: Right now, it's Brooke that I'm concerned about.",
        "Katie: She has to end this.",
        "Ridge: And she will. She will.",
        "Bill: If this is where you tell me you can't marry me --",
        "Brooke: You couldn't possibly believe that I would. Not now. Not any time soon. You lied to me, Bill. You betrayed me. You let your anger for Ridge get the best of you.",
        "Bill: I know what I did.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] Do you? Because I don't know. I don't know anymore about you, about me. About what we had together. And I doubted a man who loved me and who protected me... over a man who... [Sighs]",
        "Bill: I'll own what I did. No excuses. But on our wedding day on that beach in Abu Dhabi, pledging my life to you... I meant every word. And I always will. \"Here we stand, halfway around the world, where the desert meets the sea. Sand and water. Two timeless forces of nature. That's how I see us.\" And that's still how I see us. And we can't let this or anything tear us apart. We can never let that happen, Brooke.",
        "Ivy: Well, those Spencer brothers really are something, aren't they? Giving hope that diamond. Talk about upping the stakes.",
        "Aly: Wyatt shouldn't be upping anything. Hope's made her choice. It's Liam she wants. Wyatt's just using that diamond to get her in his trailer again.",
        "Hope: [Sighs]",
        "Liam: Hey. There you are. I've been looking all over for you.",
        "Hope: [Sighs]",
        "Liam: Everything okay?",
        "Hope: [Clears throat] [Chuckles] Wyatt gave it to me.",
        "Liam: A replica of the Hope for the Future diamond?",
        "Hope: Nope. [Chuckles] No, this is the real thing. Yeah. Ricardo Montemayor, he passed away, and he left it to Wyatt, who gave it to me.",
        "Liam: Just like he said he would.",
        "Hope: It was a real shock. It was a real shock to Wyatt, you know, and to me. Wyatt and Ricardo were acquaintances, but they weren't family, you know? But Ricardo, he didn't have any heirs at all.",
        "Liam: Yeah, so Wyatt lucked out. And now he's the proud owner of the Hope for the Future diamond, and he's already using it to his advantage. Damn it! Damn it, damn it! I sh-- I should have anticipated this would happen. I mean, you -- you know you can't keep that, right? Hope, you have to give it back. Like, today."
