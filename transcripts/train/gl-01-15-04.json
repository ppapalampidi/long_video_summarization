        "Salerno pays a visit to Danny and one thing is very clear: he supports Danny's political aspirations, because he thinks it will serve his interests. Danny disabuses him of that notion by ripping up Salerno's contribution check \u0096 one made to \"Cash\" \u0096 but as Danny's doing this he's unaware Ross is declaring his intention to win, whatever it takes: Ross tasted defeat once before and isn't anxious to repeat the process. Just what turning Salerno away may cost Danny becomes clear when Ross lets Danny and Bill know the playing field isn't exactly level: the law allows him to use his unused Senate campaign funds for the mayoral race, while Danny faces strict limits on what he can raise. Danny realizes: he can't win the money war with Ross. Reva is trying to ascertain what's troubling Shayne when Josh arrives, and tries to help by putting to rest any notion Shayne might have that Josh is expecting him to return to baseball. But Reva sees that Shayne's concerns go even deeper: if he gives up baseball, then what? Reva tells him to embrace the clean slate, and make something new of his life. As Reva's telling Shayne this, Josh has found Billy, who's so stressed about the secret coming out about Maryanne Caruthers that he's considered drinking. Josh talks him down but Billy's troubles go beyond that: he dragged Josh into this, nearly 30 years ago, and he'll never forgive himself for it. Harley has another encounter with Brad, who's turning up the heat romantically. She escapes but has gained a tidbit: Alex is not pleased about all the questions Harley's been asking. Jeffrey advises Harley to take Alex to lunch to probe and learn what she can. Harley would rather eat glass \u0096 which, by coincidence, is Alex's same sentiment. But she, too, has realized it may be in her best interest to get together with Harley and learn what she may know. So the date is set, and the only thing left to do is order the wine. Lots and lots of wine."

        "Harley: Jeffrey? It's me. Jeffrey? Wow, this place sure is dusty. Could use a little tidying up.",
        "Jeffrey: Find what you're looking for?",
        "Harley: Would you believe I was tidying up?",
        "Jeffrey: No.",
        "Harley: I'm sorry. I was snooping.",
        "Jeffrey: Mm-hmm.",
        "Harley: It's just there's still so much I don't know.",
        "Jeffrey: Ever try asking?",
        "Harley: You would lie.",
        "Jeffrey: Probably. You'll learn more when I want you to learn more. Besides, there's nothing in here you're going to find, anyway.",
        "Harley: How do you know I haven't been poking around here before? How do you know what I'm doing when you're not listening?",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, I know. Trust me. I know.",
        "Reva: Shayne, just listen to me, please.",
        "Shayne: Why? Why? So you could call me another name?",
        "Reva: I didn't call you a name.",
        "Shayne: Oh, no? That wasn't you a minute ago calling me a quitter?",
        "Josh: You called him a quitter?",
        "Reva: No. I didn't call him a quitter. I said I was confused because he's never been a quitter, but he's acting like one now.",
        "Shayne: Oh, and since I didn't go Stanford like you wanted me to, I'm too stupid to know the difference between the two.",
        "Reva: Oh, Shayne, please.",
        "Josh: Okay, okay. Time out. Time out. Can somebody just start from the beginning and fill me in?",
        "Reva: If I could go first.",
        "Shayne: Oh, yeah go ahead. You're just going to try to get out of what you said.",
        "Reva: I told him that I've been watching him all day.",
        "Shayne: Yeah, all day. All day? My first real day back from the hospital. And what? I can't sit in my chair? I can't be tired? Rest?",
        "Reva: Being tired is fine. As long as that's all that this is about. But I just get the feeling that you're feeling, I don't know, overwhelmed. That everything's happening a little too fast. You have all these people throwing out all these ideas about what you should be doing when you can walk again. I mean, you've had a lot of disappointments up to this last surgery. And maybe there's a part of that that you don't trust. That maybe now that you're on the verge to getting everything back, you're afraid something's going to happen.",
        "Josh: There's nothing wrong with that, Son. And it certainly doesn't make you a quitter.",
        "Shayne: If I hadn't flipped out by now, what did you think? That maybe I wouldn't Okay, maybe I'm a little scared.",
        "Blake: Oh, that better not be a belated pre-nup. Ship has sailed, hubby.",
        "Ross: A prenuptial, oh, no. Perish the thought. Now this is a report that I commissioned from an election consultant.",
        "Blake: Oh. Handy tips on how to win, hmm?",
        "Ross: Well, according to them, it's going to be a little more involved and lot more unpleasant than I thought. They say I should hit Danny hard and keep on doing it. Starting with who he is.",
        "Blake: The fact that he's a Santos?",
        "Ross: Mm-hmm. I say I should never refer to him as anything but Mr. Santos.",
        "Blake: Why not skip the formality and just call him a mobster? Come on, Ross, you can't spend the entire campaign dragging him through the mud.",
        "Ross: Blake, it's politics.",
        "Blake: It's a smear campaign. I know all about them. Wouldn't you rather win on the merit of your ideas?",
        "Ross: I gave up the chance to serve in public office once before when I was elected to the senate. Whatever it takes, I am not going to give up that opportunity again.",
        "Salerno: Nice office, Daniel. You're going to keep it after you move into City Hall?",
        "Danny: I have to win the election first.",
        "Salerno: Oh. That technicality.",
        "Danny: Ross Marler would disagree.",
        "Salerno: No, he doesn't know what we know, does he?",
        "Danny: You want to fill me in, Vinnie? What do we know that Ross Marler, doesn't?",
        "Salerno: That you're a better man for the job. Certainly the voters of this fine city realize that. And if they don't, I think they can be persuaded come Election Day.",
        "Danny: You're the one who wanted this meeting. What do you want?",
        "Salerno: I'm in town on some unfortunate business. I was looking for a little wind before I leave.",
        "Danny: Seeing me notches you a wind?",
        "Salerno: It's a little territory beef with Angelo Bruzi.",
        "Danny: Yeah, it's always about territory with him. What do you want me to do? You can handle him.",
        "Salerno: I explained my point of view, but the guy's got a head like a concrete block. I know a situation like this is the least of your worries right now. You're on your way to becoming mayor. You're going to find all sorts of things making their way across your desk. I made it out to cash.",
        "Danny: That's a lot of zeros.",
        "Salerno: Like I said, the voters of the city need to know how qualified you really are. That takes money.",
        "Danny: Yeah, it does. But not yours.",
        "Blake: Fine. You hammer home Danny's former connections in all your speeches. I'm sure it will do exactly what your consultants predict. But for every time you say \"Santos,\" you better have five concrete ideas about how you would make a better mayor. Otherwise you're going to lose a bunch of votes -- including mine.",
        "Ross: Hey, hey, hey. Easy, Mrs. Marler. I never said that I was going to get to City Hall by trashing Danny Santos. All I said was that I'm not anxious to lose.",
        "Blake: But I think you can win with your smarts and your platform and your crackerjack campaign staff.",
        "Ross: Oh, that's the more important topic of the day: You.",
        "Blake: What about me?",
        "Ross: There's not really a tactful way to say this, so I'm just going to throw it out there.",
        "Blake: You know what? I don't even want to hear it.",
        "Ross: You have become a Jack of All Trades and a mistress of none.",
        "Blake: Yeah? Careful.",
        "Ross: You have gone from being a novelist to an investigative reporter to an Internet minister to a radio host, and you've done all this in about three years.",
        "Blake: This coming from a man who redefined the popular notion of a mid-life crisis?",
        "Ross: Careful. This is not a complaint.",
        "Blake: It sounds like one.",
        "Ross: No, no, no, no. It is a job offer. I need you, Blake, to have one more career: Campaign manager. Honey, help me win this election. You know, all great leaders have always had great spouses at their side. James Madison had Dolly. FDR had Eleanor.",
        "Blake: Hillary had Bill. You know, in that laundry list of jobs you just rattled off, you forgot the most recent and the most important one: My work with Harley's Angels. Ross, honey, I want you to win and I will do anything I can to support you.",
        "Ross: But not at the expense of your work with Harley and Mel?",
        "Blake: Hire a pro.",
        "Ross: Yes...",
        "Blake: Somebody who has a track record, who can win an election.",
        "Ross: Oh, I want a campaign manager I can sleep with.",
        "Blake: (Laughs)",
        "Ross: You're not really turning me down, are you? I can beg. I'm not too proud to beg. I can do that.",
        "Blake: Baby, I will straighten your tie, I will hand you babies to kiss and I will stand beside you and I'm looking like the perfect potential First Lady of Springfield. But don't ask me to quit my job. Honey, I know you. I know you. You just want to rein me in, keep me under your wing, make sure that what we have sticks. But don't you worry. What we have, let no man -- or woman -- tear asunder.",
        "Ross: All right, I understand. That's good enough for me. I've got to get going; I have an appointment.",
        "Blake: Where are you going?",
        "Ross: I'm going to go see my opponent. I'm not going to trash him in the press, but I am going to challenge him to a debate.",
        "Harley: I still have a lot of questions that you are going to have to give me the answers to...",
        "Jeffrey: You're going to get your answers, okay? Why don't you concentrate on Brad Green first and worry about me next?",
        "Harley: I'm working Brad Green.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, maybe he's working you. Did you ever think about that? The guy's smart, he's intuitive.",
        "Harley: He's turned on by the possibility of getting caught because he doesn't think he ever will.",
        "Jeffrey: He's in love with the risk.",
        "Harley: That's why he's into me. I mean, other than my fabulous good looks. Yeah. He knows I'm an ex-cop. I'm in a high-profile engagement to a detective who also happens to be a Spaulding. You do the math.",
        "Jeffrey: How'd the breakfast go? Tell me about the breakfast with him.",
        "Harley: You're my all-seeing, all-knowing handler. Just listen to the tape.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, I'd like your take on it first, if you don't mind. It's called a debriefing. Now, would you get to it, please?",
        "Harley: I played him the way that I usually do, and he played the perfect gentleman. We're both playing each other.",
        "Jeffrey: All right. You shake it, you get him interested and then you know what you've got to do.",
        "Brad: (Chuckles) You're not the feminist type, are you?",
        "Harley: Excuse me?",
        "Brad: Someone uncomfortable with a gentleman?",
        "Harley: Is that what you are?",
        "Brad: We're a dying breed. Harley, we're going to have to keep meeting each other.",
        "Harley: How many times have you used that line?",
        "Brad: Just once. But the day is still young.",
        "Jeffrey: So, what's with the musical chairs?",
        "Harley: I'm afraid of what I might catch if I get too close to the guy.",
        "Jeffrey: It's your job to get close to him.",
        "Harley: Gaining his trust and confidence is my job.",
        "Brad: Beautiful skin.",
        "Harley: I don't like dangerous games, Brad.",
        "_Brad: I do. I'm quite good at them. _",
        "Harley: Well, prove it. Do you know the meaning of the word \"discretion\"?",
        "Jeffrey: You couldn't even let the guy hold your hand?",
        "Harley: Was I hired to be a slut? Let's get a few things straight... Look, you're the one who thinks Brad Green is so damn smart. You think he's looking for someone easy?",
        "_Harley: You're very attractive. _",
        "Brad: I know.",
        "Harley: And I know you know.",
        "Brad: But do you know how I feel about you?",
        "Harley: I think I know how you feel about women in general.",
        "Brad: But you... you are quite unique.",
        "Harley: Well, obviously you feel that way, or you wouldn't be bothered with me. But perhaps you could try to disguise the thrill that you feel being able to breathe down the neck of a Spaulding fianc\u00e9e.",
        "Brad: Or you'll lose respect for me?",
        "_Harley: I won't if you'll be real. _",
        "Brad: Real?",
        "Harley: Brad, I've done some things for you and you're grateful and we're becoming friends. But we're both adults. We know what happens as friends get closer. Do I know how you feel about me? I would say you find me challenging.",
        "_Brad: Is this heading for a colossal \"no\"? Are you about to tell me I stand no chance with you? _",
        "Harley: You have no idea how hard you would have to work for a chance with me. I'm going to have the Monte Cristo. You?",
        "_Brad: Would it be forward of me if I told you right now that the only thing I'm loving is your attitude toward me? _",
        "_Harley: Honesty. That's a start. _",
        "Jeffrey: That actually worked?",
        "Harley: Some men -- powerful men, especially -- sometimes like to be put on a leash. Brad Green is now on mine. And as a bonus, it's driving Alexandra Spaulding crazy.",
        "Alexandra: Oh... you are being very quiet again.",
        "Buzz: You're ranting.",
        "Alexandra: I'm only asking questions that happen to be pertinent to my life, and so it involves your daughter Harley. But look, look, it's me. I know when things are off-kilter with you.",
        "Buzz: I have issues on my mind which I am not prepared to share right now.",
        "Alexandra: You're sure?",
        "Buzz: Yeah.",
        "Alexandra: Well, then enough about you.",
        "Buzz: Okay.",
        "Alexandra: Back to me. Why is Harley asking questions of Brad Green?",
        "Buzz: You keep throwing me that! I don't know. Maybe there's a follow-up to a case that somehow Mr. Green was involved in, you know?",
        "Alexandra: Well, I doubt it, because the only thing she's been asking about is me.",
        "Shayne: I'm not a quitter. I just don't know what's going to happen. I mean, I know what I was wishing for and what I'm wishing for now: to get out of this chair. And now it seems like it might actually happen. And then what? What do I do? You know what I'm talking about.",
        "Josh: Is this about baseball?",
        "Shayne: Sort of.",
        "Josh: You're wondering what you're going to get back, or whether or not you'll ever be able to take the mound again? Is that it? Because I'll tell you what my first thought is: You're going to find out that your talent hasn't gone anywhere. Son, you were born with an amazing gift. Whether or not you'll be able to... your body will be able to relearn the things that it used to do so naturally, I don't know. Will you be a dominant player again? Will you ever play at the level you used to? Will you be major-league material again? I don't know.",
        "Reva: Joshua, I thought that we, um...",
        "Josh: Those are the questions that are going on in your mind, right?",
        "Shayne: Yeah, pretty much.",
        "Josh: I'll tell you this: If you want to get going on baseball again, I will help you. If somewhere in the back of your mind, you're thinking that you'll never be as good as you used to be, I think you should try anyway, but I don't think that's what this is about, Son. Let me ask you another question, okay? Are you afraid to try because you think that somehow I'll be disappointed if you don't do well? I've learned my lesson, Shayne. I've learned my lesson in the hardest way possible. Nobody's expecting you to go into a phone booth and come out wearing a red cape, least of all me. I will never be disappointed in anything you choose to do with your life, as long as you do it the best you can. No matter what it is, whether it's baseball or anything else. I will respect your choices. I will be behind you no matter what you decide.",
        "Reva: Me, too.",
        "Josh: Your life. It's your choices.",
        "Shayne: I just wish I knew what I wanted.",
        "Reva: Shayne, sweetie, you don't have to know right now what you want to do with your life.",
        "Josh: It's not a bad thing. One more piece of advice, though. Listen to your heart. Cultivate who you are, figure out what right and wrong means to you and stick with that. You see, there was a time when I was just about your age, maybe a little older, that I had a very important choice that I had to make. And I let somebody else make it for me. And I have regretted that decision ever since then.",
        "Shayne: This isn't about baseball anymore, right?",
        "Josh: No, it's not. And if I thought that telling you about it would somehow... that somehow I could go back and fix it by doing that, I would do that. But I made the mistake and I've learned to live with it. I'm just trying to say to you that you're going to make mistakes in your life, but they'll be a lot easier to deal with if you know that you're the one that made the choices in the first place.",
        "(Cell phone ringing)",
        "Josh: I'm sorry. It's your Uncle Billy. I'll be right back. Where are you?",
        "Billy: I'm at Towers and I'm just about to have myself two fingers of bourbon, Josh.",
        "Josh: What?",
        "Billy: How soon can you get over here?",
        "Josh: I'm on my way.",
        "Billy: I'm waiting for somebody. I'll order when they get here.",
        "Josh: Um, I have to go and I'm sorry about that. But I want you to know that no matter what you do, whatever you decide, I'll be there for you. Okay?",
        "Shayne: Yeah.",
        "Reva: Josh? Wait a minute. What is going on? Does this have something to do with whatever it is that's eating you?",
        "Josh: Reva.",
        "Reva: No, because something is. I mean, we both know it.",
        "Josh: I... I have to go find Billy.",
        "Danny: You might think that our previous association entitles you to certain considerations.",
        "Salerno: I was hoping.",
        "Danny: You thought wrong, and you're wasting your time. This meeting's over.",
        "Salerno: You know something? I think you need a refresher course in how the real world works before you take office -- at least our world.",
        "Danny: Vinnie, what I'm gaining in credibility, you will never be able to buy, so get this straight --",
        "Salerno: No, you get this...",
        "Danny: No, get this: Danny Santos is not for sale! I think we've said all we need to say, don't you?",
        "Salerno: It's your call, Danny. Make sure you're making the right choices.",
        "(Knock at door)",
        "Danny: Ross.",
        "Ross: Um...",
        "Danny: Hey. Hi.",
        "Ross: Bad time?",
        "Danny: No, not at all.",
        "Salerno: Ross Marler.",
        "Ross: Yes.",
        "Salerno: How you doing, Counselor?",
        "Ross: Good. Vincent Salerno, isn't it?",
        "Salerno: My reputation precedes me.",
        "Ross: On a national basis.",
        "Danny: Now, I saw you try to hide that little double-take you just made when I opened the door. I'm sure with Vinnie being here and with me being who I've been, it looks like it could be a good parlay for you.",
        "Ross: If I were running that type of campaign, which I am not. So, if you and Mr. Salerno have business to discuss...",
        "Danny: No, no, no. We don't. We don't. We never will.",
        "Salerno: Not yet.",
        "Danny: Not ever. So long, Vinnie. Come on in, Ross.",
        "Ross: Thank you.",
        "Danny: So, what are you going to do?",
        "Ross: You know, Danny, you can't run from your past, but judging how you got rid of Vinnie the Fox, it doesn't look like he's part of your present.",
        "Danny: He's not. So, are you going to go to the press with this?",
        "Ross: No.",
        "Danny: What can I do for you?",
        "Ross: I'm here to propose a debate.",
        "Danny: Debate? Wow. Why am I not surprised? Debate is what you do, as a lawyer in the courtroom, at least. I'm sure you'll have no trouble coming across as a seasoned professional.",
        "Ross: (Laughs) \"Seasoned professional.\" That's a euphemism for insider, I take it? Is that what I have to look forward to in this campaign? Mr. Insider versus Man of the People?",
        "Danny: No. I think a debate is a terrific idea. I do. Let's hammer out the details now. We can do that or I can have Bill call your office. There he is.",
        "Bill: Hello.",
        "Ross: Bill.",
        "Bill: Ross. Here to concede?",
        "Ross: Concede? You're a funny guy.",
        "Bill: No, I'm serious. Somebody made a huge media buy this morning.",
        "Ross: Really?",
        "Bill: Yeah, and my contacts have told me how much money you spent.",
        "Ross: Okay.",
        "Bill: I don't know, Ross. Your campaign is less than a week old and with contribution limits what they are, there's no way you can have that much money on hand. So, Ross, I know you want to win this thing, but I didn't think you would actually break the law to do it.",
        "Buzz: So Harley's asking about you. I don't see how that matters much!",
        "Alexandra: Asking questions of Brad Green, yeah.",
        "Buzz: A well-known rat-fink. Big deal! Come on.",
        "Alexandra: Why is she asking these questions, anyway? What the devil does she hope to gain?",
        "Buzz: I don't know what she's working on. I don't know. Maybe it's about me.",
        "Alexandra: Why would she be asking questions about her very own father? I...",
        "Buzz: Well, she's known you for a while. She knows we're an item. Maybe she's being overprotective. Maybe she doesn't have a clue what you were up to in Europe and obviously this Mr. Green does, so maybe she wants to get a line on the woman that her old man is dating.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, if my life were ever that easy, it wouldn't be my life.",
        "Harley: Alexandra got all bent out of shape when she found out that I was pumping Brad for information about her.",
        "Jeffrey: How did she find out that you were checking her out?",
        "Harley: Brad told her.",
        "Jeffrey: He told her?",
        "Harley: You and I know that we're investigating Brad, but he doesn't. He probably didn't think twice about telling Alexandra anything. Now Alexandra thinks that I'm asking about her, which puts Brad off knowing that I'm trying to get stuff on him.",
        "Jeffrey: The old bait and switch.",
        "Harley: Yes.",
        "Jeffrey: Works every time.",
        "Harley: And the best is Brad's theory about why Alexandra's upset. He thinks she's jealous.",
        "Jeffrey: Of you?",
        "Harley: Those two used to have a thing.",
        "Jeffrey: So Brad slept his way to the top. Imagine that.",
        "Harley: That is so male. See, trust a man to always think it's about him.",
        "Alexandra: Just because your daughter is asking questions about Brad Green, that doesn't mean it has anything to do with you.",
        "Buzz: I don't see how it matters much one way or the other.",
        "Alexandra: No, no. I think it does...",
        "Buzz: Listen, I told you my theory and that's all I got. If you're so damn interested in what Harley thinks, why don't you just stop speculating and go to the source? You know, cut to the chase, follow the money. Whatever clich\u00e9 works for you.",
        "Alexandra: (Sputtering) What in the world is bothering you?",
        "Buzz: Darling, what you need to do is call my daughter, ask her to lunch and then ask her what's what.",
        "Alexandra: (Laughs) Do you see this awful grimace coming over my face? You can't be serious.",
        "Jeffrey: I'm serious. I want you to invite her to lunch. Call her and invite her to lunch. See if you can get more on her than this jealousy angle.",
        "Harley and Alexandra: Lunch?",
        "Harley and Alexandra: With that woman?",
        "Harley and Alexandra: I'd rather chew glass.",
        "Jeffrey: I don't think I need to remind you what's at stake here, or do I?",
        "Harley: No.",
        "Jeffrey: This corruption at Spaulding, it runs deep, okay? And it could destroy Phillip and it can hurt Gus as well. Alex is the link. How? I don't know yet, but we're going to find out. And if Alex gives us an opening, we're going to take it. Okay? You're going to have to call her. We're going to fry more than one fish, here.",
        "Harley: I will call. But my patience is wearing thin, Jeffrey.",
        "(Cell phone ringing)",
        "Harley: I want some answers. Surprise, surprise. It's the Dragon Lady herself.",
        "Alexandra: Harley! It's Alexandra.",
        "Harley: Alexandra. This is a surprise. I was just about to call you.",
        "Alexandra: Really? Well, that's curious. Great minds, I guess. Well, anyway, I was wondering if you would join me for lunch.",
        "Harley: Lunch?",
        "Alexandra: Yes. I mean, we used to be such good friends and so much has gotten in the way.",
        "Harley: Yes, it has.",
        "Alexandra: Well, this is a bit of a New Year's resolution. A little bit of personal housecleaning.",
        "Harley: Well, I have to say I'm flattered.",
        "Alexandra: Well, yes. It could be quite liberating, don't you think? I mean, you and I getting past some things and starting afresh. I know it would make your father very happy. Why don't we say, well, how about today at the Towers? I have a standing reservation, there. By the way, what were you going to call me about?",
        "Harley: Um, so funny. My mind is a complete blank. Maybe I'll remember in time for our lunch date.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, well, perhaps. Well, Harley, I'm looking forward to it.",
        "Harley: Me, too. If anything happens to Phillip or Gus because of something you didn't tell me, I will never forgive you.",
        "Reva: Hungry? I thought I owed you some of my homemade guacamole for calling you a quitter.",
        "Shayne: Mom, I know you didn't mean it like that. It's just the way I heard it, you know? Because I... I feel like if I heard it a different way, then I'd be admitting something about myself to myself. I wasn't ready for it.",
        "Reva: Did I ever tell you about my friend, Cynthia Lorre?",
        "Shayne: No, I don't think so.",
        "Reva: 34 years old, diagnosed terminal. Doctors gave her six months to live. After she got over the initial shock of that, she prepared for the end. She was remarkable. She did all those things you're supposed to do, you know? Got all of her paperwork in order, all of those things you imagine doing, but never really think you're going to ever have to do it. She found the time to say goodbye to all of her friends and family. I ran into her one day, and she looked horrible. Completely devastated. And I thought, ugh... I assumed the worst, you know? That she was going to die or at least that she was ready to, or that she'd found her peace.",
        "Shayne: So you got the chance to say goodbye to her.",
        "Reva: I didn't have to. She told me she was in total remission.",
        "Shayne: That was kind of a miracle.",
        "Reva: She was handed back her life.",
        "Shayne: So, then what'd she do?",
        "Reva: What she said to me, I'll never forget. She didn't know. She didn't know what to do. She said she'd spent so much of her time preparing to die that she totally forgotten how to live. I just thought that might be something you'd be interested in hearing.",
        "Billy: Oh, Little Brother, you have no idea how much I want that drink right now.",
        "Josh: Well, considering what we've been dealing with lately, I can imagine.",
        "Billy: Yeah. Yeah, I got this little voice inside of me telling me everything would be just a little bit better with one drink.",
        "Josh: The question is, would that little drink be worth what you would lose?",
        "Billy: I'll tell you, Josh, I really don't know anymore.",
        "Josh: See, that's why I'm here, Billy: To remind you that nothing is worth your going back to the bottle again. Things are tough right now. We need you.",
        "Billy: You need me? Well, who am I? I heard you the other day, Josh, and I think that I may just have lost touch with who I am, or at least who I was supposed to be, 30 years ago.",
        "Ross: Yes, thank you. That's exactly what I thought. No, no, I'm going to be at the office later, so I'll see you then. Thanks. Bill, you were right. My campaign did make the media purchase that you somehow got wind of.",
        "Bill: Yeah, well, commercial time like that doesn't come cheap.",
        "Ross: No. This guy takes good care of you. You're lucky to have him.",
        "Bill: Now, look, Ross, maybe you've gotten into something that you actually weren't even aware of. I don't know, maybe you can blame an overeager staff person.",
        "Danny: Right. Right, I'm sure we could work something out. The state bar does not have to find out about this if we can come to some sort of agreement.",
        "Bill: Now, may I suggest...",
        "Ross: You're like sharks with blood in the water. I don't know if it's arrogance of youth or just plain sloppy, lazy work, but if this is how you intend to run the city, I'd better win for the sake of the people, don't you think?",
        "Danny: Ross, if what Bill said is true, you violated two or three campaign statutes with this one media purchase. I mean, I don't know what you're thinking, but we can't just let that slide.",
        "Bill: Well, I'm afraid we have to, Danny. ( Clears throat)",
        "Ross: A little slow on the uptake, Bill, but I knew you'd figure it out.",
        "Bill: Oh, is that right?",
        "Danny: Figure out what? What are you talking about?",
        "Ross: You know, the odd thing is, if you had made the exact same purchase that I did, you would have broken the law for spending money that you weren't allowed to raise.",
        "Danny: Right. But what? You're somehow above the law?",
        "Ross: No, no, no. Actually, I'm very much within it. I could... Bill, why don't you explain it to him.",
        "Danny: Please.",
        "Bill: Well, the same law that puts a cap on our fundraising limits has a loophole big enough for Ross here to drive his campaign bus through.",
        "Danny: What loophole?",
        "Bill: He's allowed to roll over any leftover money from the senate race he ran a few years back.",
        "Danny: Right. Right. And I bet that money's just been sitting around somewhere gathering a lot of interest.",
        "Ross: There you go. For a long, long time. There is a lot of money in the war chest, and I can spend every penny of it legally, and I probably will. This meeting's been very good because now I know that you guys want to play hardball, and so allow me to say, \"Welcome to the big leagues.\"",
        "Danny: What are you thinking?",
        "Bill: Well, if the campaign comes down to who has more money to spend, we're toast.",
        "Reva: Whatever you do, it's your choice. We certainly know you're brave enough to face whatever limitations life throws your way. The hard part is going to be seeing those limitations and being able to envision what you can be.",
        "Shayne: But if I just give it all up and I just go in a completely different direction, isn't that kind of like me just throwing away my gift?",
        "Reva: You're the only one who can answer that. But who's to say you only have one gift? Whatever expectations you have, they're the ones you set for yourself. What do they call it on the computer when you hit that button and it turns off and then it turns back on again?",
        "Shayne: That's rebooting.",
        "Reva: Rebooting. You can reboot your whole life. How many people would love to have the chance to do that?",
        "Josh: All right, look. As long as I am here, you are not going to take a drink.",
        "Billy: Yeah, well, the problem always is when you're not here.",
        "Josh: Stand up and look at me, Billy. We are going to walk the streets together day and night if that's what we have to do, but you are going to beat this thing, one minute at a time. And then one hour, and then one day.",
        "Billy: Yeah. Yeah, I will not drink today.",
        "Josh: You will not drink today.",
        "Billy: And tomorrow...",
        "Josh: We're not worried about tomorrow. It's not here yet. We're only worried about right now.",
        "Billy: Josh, let me ask you something -- and don't get mad at me -- but, I mean, why do you bother? I mean, really? After all I put you through, after the mess that I've gotten you into.",
        "Josh: Billy, there's no reason for us to talk about the past right now. We can't change it.",
        "Billy: Josh, Josh... you know what this is all about? You know why I'm here? I'm here because I failed you. I did, 30 years ago. You were just a kid and you looked up to me. You hung with me because you wanted to have fun in the worst way. And everything that happened since then, it is my fault, because you see, I was supposed to take care of you. I was not supposed to let you get so involved in a big mess that some 30 years later, you can't even be the man that you are and live the life that you want. Now, see, that's wrong. No, I figure I failed you in just about the worst way a brother could fail a brother.",
        "Josh: Let's get you out of this place. Come on.",
        "Alexandra: Harley?",
        "Harley: Alex.",
        "Alexandra: Darling, you look marvelous.",
        "Harley: Thank you. And you... that lipstick has got to be from your new line.",
        "Alexandra: You caught me. I'm being a Bad Girl.",
        "Harley: No, the shade is fabulous on you.",
        "Alexandra: You like it? I can get you lots of samples.",
        "Harley: Thank you. Sure.",
        "Waiter: Can I get you ladies a table, or something from the bar?",
        "Alexandra and Harley: Absolutely. Not fast enough.",
        "Alexandra: Next, on Guiding Light",
        "Alan: Perhaps even move away from Springfield, and I'll be happy to help you do that.",
        "Michelle: You're following me, Buzz, and I don't like it. It's an invasion of my privacy.",
        "Buzz: Well, then you must know how you make your father feel, the way you're treating him."
