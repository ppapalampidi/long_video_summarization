        "Carrie gathers the three young women, wanting to know if their fathers and loved ones have demonstrated any regret or remorse, now that they've received the second letters. Marah and Marina reluctantly admit that the letters have only heightened the tension and the cover-up. Michelle is the last of the three to show up. She must first sneak out of the hospital to avoid Ed's suspicion. But Ed follows her, tormented by the thought that she could be with the person who had dredged up all the painful history of Maryanne Caruthers. At the same time, he hates himself for following his daughter as if she were his enemy. When he vents his rage at Buzz and Alan, they are less than sympathetic; and they insist Ed take them to where he last saw Michelle. But when they get there they are in for a surprise. Earlier, Alan and Alex discuss their concern with the \"right of succession\" at Spaulding, now that Phillip's mental health is an issue. Alan clearly sees Gus as his heir apparent much to Alex's dislike. And when Gus and Bill demonstrate a shared enthusiasm for a Spaulding/Lewis \"relationship,\" Alan seems to be getting his wish. However, Gus remains determined to return to the police force - where his natural curiosity causes him to doubt Alan's story about the stolen car. Alex, meanwhile, chastised by Gus for not keeping Brad Green on a tighter leash, seeks Brad out and warns him that his womanizing could very well cost them everything they've achieved even though what they've achieved has not been entirely by honest means. Their meeting with the Shadow does not convince Tony or Eden that Bill has done something corrupt. But it does tell Tony that if Eden truly loves Bill it's up to her to prove his innocence. Eden is appalled \u0096 Tony wants her to spy on her lover? But Tony points out it's the only way to clear Bill's name. And by the end of the evening, Eden is in Bill's arms, knowing that to help him, she must betray his trust."

    "Transcript": [
        "Tony: Danny is done with the mob. And he sure as hell did not go bringing them into Lewis, all right?",
        "Shadow: No, he didn't. Bill did.",
        "Eden: That is a lie.",
        "Tony: Don't let him get a rise out of you. He's nuts. Everyone knows that Bill is squeaky clean.",
        "Shadow: Bill is human with all the weaknesses, quirks and ambition that implies. Isn't that right, Ms. August?",
        "Bill: It's not only power. It's more like a sense of accomplishment. You know, Josh, my dad, they put their faith in me and I delivered.",
        "_Eden: Yes, you did. Tried 200%. _",
        "Bill: That's right. That's right. And now Josh wants to bring in some stranger to micromanage and tell me how to do a better job. I mean, you cannot do a better job that I've been doing.",
        "Eden: I agree.",
        "_Bill: So then why is he doing this? _",
        "Tony: You know what, Eden? Let's go. This is crazy. Let's go. Please.",
        "Shadow: I noticed she's listening. Not to mix metaphors, but perhaps love isn't blind after all. (Laughs)",
        "Bill: Well, like I said, getting you out of the dog house with Eden is the most obvious reason we'll be working together.",
        "Gus: You're not concerned about money or power? Nothing like that?",
        "Bill: No, no. Yeah, of course not. Not money and power. Of course not. Hey, did I tell you about the idea about the trucking?",
        "Gus: Put it on hold. What?",
        "Buzz: You...",
        "Gus: Hold a second.",
        "Buzz: You put a bug in her ear.",
        "Gus: I didn't put anything in Harley's ear.",
        "Buzz: I'm at death's door?",
        "Gus: No. Listen you said that you weren't going to be around. That's what you said.",
        "Buzz: I changed the menu. So I'm dying?",
        "Gus: And then you said you changed the menu.",
        "Buzz: The menu's the same. Go inside and check it out.",
        "Gus: The menu has not changed in years.",
        "Buzz: Go.",
        "Gus: Am I wrong?",
        "Bill: Whoa! Well, hey, man, we did just get here. So let me get some Buzz burgers and talk you into sticking around over at Spaulding.",
        "Gus: Yeah, I know what's on your menu, pal.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, he had such an awful, blank look in his eyes.",
        "Alan: Alexandra, that does not mean Phillip is not going to recover.",
        "Alexandra: Well, have you honestly seen any improvement in him?",
        "Alan: You know, I think you saw him on a very bad day. Now, it is possible that he won't resume control of Spaulding and I think you and I have to prepare for that.",
        "Alexandra: Well, I can see your suggestion right now. You'd become permanent CEO.",
        "Alan: You know this may come as a surprise to you, but I am very happy as Senior Consultant.",
        "Alexandra: You mean Puppet Master. Well, whatever happens, it's obvious that Spaulding Enterprises must be run by a member of the family.",
        "Alan: (Laughs) On that point, Alexandra, I couldn't agree with you more.",
        "Rick: Hey.",
        "Beth: Hey. I brought Cook's potato leek soup. You?",
        "Rick: I made the much more manly choice. I got him chilly fries and soda tonight. Come here often?",
        "Beth: Yeah, as matter of fact I do. I try to stop by late at night when nobody else is around. And sometimes he's better. I talk to him a little.",
        "Rick: Well, that's good, Beth. I mean that has to be good for him.",
        "Beth: I hope so. Oh, Rick, it's so strange. Even with Phillip like this, I still look to him when I want to feel safe. Old habits, huh?",
        "Rick: Of course.",
        "Beth: So what are you doing here so late?",
        "Rick: I was working late at the hospital. Shayne Lewis took his first steps tonight. So, I mean that's obviously a big step for the family.",
        "Beth: That's wonderful.",
        "Rick: You know, Beth, I was actually wishing I could call my buddy up and meet him at the county club for a beer, you know, talk about family stuff. You know, all the times I'd wish he'd keep his damn opinions to himself, right now I'd give anything for him to tell me what to do.",
        "Marina: I still can't believe that Shayne walked. I mean, he walked.",
        "Marah: He's not going to look back, either. I guess sort of like my dad and Buzz.",
        "Marina: Where is she anyway? Carrie?",
        "Marah: We got your message. What was so important that you needed us to come here?",
        "Marina: I know, we ditched a serious celebration with Shayne to come meet you.",
        "Marah: Couldn't it have waited?",
        "Carrie: As a matter of fact, it couldn't.",
        "Marina: You always sneak up on us like this.",
        "Carrie: Forgive me. It's an irresistible urge.",
        "Marina: Shayne walked tonight.",
        "Carrie: Well, of course he did. Isn't that what you wished for?",
        "Marina: You know that I did.",
        "Carrie: Well, in lieu of thanks, what about a little enthusiasm as oppose to all this grumbling? Where's Michelle? When I call the three of you, I expect to see the three of you.",
        "Michelle: Hey, Dr. Raj, could you do me a favor? Could you cover for me for, like, an hour or so? Because there's something I have to take care of.",
        "Dr. Raj: No problem.",
        "Michelle: Thank you. I really appreciate it.",
        "Ed: Busy?",
        "Michelle: I thought you changed your schedule so we wouldn't bump into each like this.",
        "Ed: I'm just working late tonight. I saw... I saw Shayne Lewis take his first steps.",
        "Michelle: Yeah, I heard about that. That's really wonderful news.",
        "Ed: Is that still painful?",
        "Michelle: Physically or emotionally? Dad, there's a patient that I am concerned about and I was hoping you could give me your opinion on it.",
        "Ed: Sure. I mean if there's anything I could help you with...",
        "(Pager beeps)",
        "Ed: It's an outside call. Call for Michelle Bauer?",
        "Carrie: Where are you, Michelle? We need a fourth. And it's not for bridge.",
        "Michelle: I'm glad to hear that you're responding to treatment.",
        "Carrie: You're not alone?",
        "Michelle: That's right.",
        "Carrie: You're with your father.",
        "Michelle: Right again. I wish that all my patients paid as much attention to detail as you do.",
        "Carrie: Marah and Marina are already here.",
        "Michelle: They are...",
        "Carrie: It isn't very complicated, Michelle. We're at a crossroads. We cannot go forward without you. Get rid of whatever you're doing. I want to see you here now.",
        "Michelle: Okay, well, keep up the good work.",
        "Ed: It sounded positive.",
        "Michelle: Yeah, actually it was the patient that I was talking to you about. She seemed to have turned the corner all by herself.",
        "Ed: Well, I'm sure you had something to do with that. I mean you've got such a gift for healing.",
        "Michelle: I try. Well, it's going to be a really busy night, so I'd better get to it.",
        "Ed: Okay. Hey. Don't you know when to go home? I thought you shifted ended, what, twenty minutes ago?",
        "Dr. Raj: I'm doing your daughter a favor.",
        "Ed: Michelle? What kind of a favor? What do you mean?",
        "Dr. Raj: She didn't tell you? She's going out for awhile. But don't worry, I'm covering for her.",
        "Carrie: What did your father and your uncle say when you gave them the second letters?",
        "Marah: What do you think they said? They were shocked.",
        "Carrie: And what happened when you told him that you knew the truth about what happened to Maryanne? Did they admit their responsibility?",
        "Marah: No. No, Uncle Billy said that it never happened.",
        "Carrie: And you father?",
        "Marah: Nothing. He couldn't even look at me. He just looked away.",
        "Carrie: Well, that at least proves he has a conscious. So Shayne walked again. Well, that's a gift. A gift to both of you. That's more than Maryanne ever had. She never drew another breath. And your grandfather knows that. What did he say to you?",
        "Marina: He said that someone was trying to use me.",
        "Carrie: And you believe that? Do you believe that I am lying to you?",
        "Marina: No.",
        "Carrie: And you? Do you believe that I am lying to you?",
        "Marah: No.",
        "Marina: He asked me who had been talking to me. I don't know. It was just like the look on his face, you know, I never seen anything like that before. His eyes went like icy cold.",
        "Marah: Yeah, the same with my Uncle Billy.",
        "Carrie: That's the way some men are when they're cornered. That makes them extremely dangerous.",
        "(Phone rings)",
        "Buzz: Hello?",
        "Ed: Buzz, we're in trouble.",
        "Buzz: Ed, what's wrong?",
        "Ed: Michelle just lied to me. She lied about what was happening.",
        "Buzz: Where are you now?",
        "Ed: I'm at the hospital. Now listen she told me that she had kind of a busy schedule tonight, but then as it turns out she asked someone to cover for her and uh... so she could go out for awhile, you know. Where's Marina?",
        "Buzz: I don't... probably celebrating with Shayne.",
        "Ed: No, see, I don't think so. Josh and Reva drove off with Shayne. Marina's with Marah. They got into Marah's car and they drove off together and they drove off really fast in another direction.",
        "Buzz: Where is Michelle now?",
        "Ed: Well, I don't know. She's probably going out to the parking lot. She's got to check out first.",
        "Buzz: Ed, follow her. She can lead us to the person that's squeezing us.",
        "Ed: Buzz, I don't know anything about following people.",
        "Buzz: Damn it, I'd go across the street myself, but she's probably gone.",
        "Ed: This is insane.",
        "Buzz: Ed, you have a cell phone. If there's a snag, call. Now go.",
        "Alan: Well, well, well, look who's here.",
        "Gus: Hello.",
        "Alan: What is this, boys' night out? A bowling league? A poker game, maybe?",
        "Gus: No, we're actually talking shop.",
        "Alan: One of my favorite expressions.",
        "Bill: Here you go, folks. I hope Danny can count on your vote come election day.",
        "Alexandra: Whoa! Well, actually I haven't... I'm still undecided.",
        "Bill: Undecided. Well, we got to change that. Danny Santos is the best friend the business community in this town could ask for.",
        "Gus: He also has something else up his sleeve, an idea to put Spaulding and Lewis together.",
        "Bill: Yeah, thanks. Thanks, Gus. Gus and I were talking about making it ongoing instead of on a project-to-project basis.",
        "Gus: Not that I'll be around to, you know, see it come to... I'm going to go back to the force next week.",
        "Alan: But in the meantime, you think Bill is on to something here?",
        "Gus: Well, I got some great ideas for Spaulding Pharmaceuticals.",
        "Alexandra: Which happens to be my division.",
        "Bill: Is that right?",
        "Alexandra: Uh-huh.",
        "Gus: Why don't you just listen, Auntie Alexandra. Because he's got some good ideas that's going to save the company a lot of money.",
        "Bill: Yeah, here it goes. Take a look at this. And keep this guy around here. I'm sure we can come up with a lot of ways to save you a bunch of money, goose up that bottom line of yours.",
        "Eden: First you say Danny and Bill are in danger and then you say Bill is the danger. Which one is it?",
        "Shadow: Let me paint you a little picture. Imagine the Fifth Street project as a company picnic thrown by Danny Santos and Lewis Construction. Everybody's happy, having a good time.",
        "Eden: And plenty of goodies to go around.",
        "Shadow: Exactly. Then somebody drops a bread crumb, a single crumb. Maybe by accident, maybe not. Either way, nobody notices until the first rat shows up and then another and then another. Pretty soon the whole place is overrun.",
        "Tony: That's nice.",
        "Shadow: The point is, if you follow the crumbs, you will find the rats.",
        "Cop: Who's there? Hey, what's going on here? Hey, break it up.",
        "Tony: Sorry, Officer. I just got a little carried away. (Laughs)",
        "Cop: Well, sorry to disturb you. I just wanted to make sure everybody was okay.",
        "Tony: Well, we are. Thank you.",
        "Cop: All right.",
        "Eden: Was that necessary?",
        "Tony: Probably not, but I'm not very good with imagination, so...",
        "Eden: You know, the only reason I am here with you is because I thought we were helping Danny and Bill. And now I am not so sure.",
        "Tony: Why not?",
        "Eden: Why not? Isn't there a tiny little part in your brain that is wondering whether we're being set up?",
        "Tony: Set up to what? To hurt Danny and Bill? No, Eden. If that... Look at me. If that was the idea, okay, the Shadow could easily... already gone to the cops. All right, I think he's on the level about what he's telling us. It doesn't take a genius to figure out that he means the rats and mob have already got into Lewis Construction. All right, now as far as the crumbs, I just...",
        "Eden: We don't need that.",
        "Tony: Wait. Where... where are you going?",
        "Eden: I am going home. The fastest and easiest way to find if the mob has a hold on Lewis is to ask Bill directly.",
        "Tony: You're not going anywhere, okay.",
        "Alan: Bill, I like the way you think. But, unfortunately, I'm going to have to pass on your proposal.",
        "Bill: You mean a twenty-five percent lower shipping cost? That doesn't interest you?",
        "Alan: Well, what we would save with your trucking firm, we would compromise on security.",
        "Bill: No, no, no, no. This outfit is completely reliable.",
        "Alan: Well, for ordinary commodities. But, you see, pharmaceuticals are a primary target of industrial espionage. And our competitors are looking for our weak spots.",
        "Gus: So then you're saying that Spaulding Securities can never go to an outside source?",
        "Alan: Precisely.",
        "Alexandra: Look, you know fresh new ideas are always welcomed except that there's no substitute for experience.",
        "Gus: Talk about experience, guess who I ran into? At Olivia's Bar, Brad Green, Mr. Experience, himself.",
        "Alan: And?",
        "Gus: And he was with a woman that wasn't his wife.",
        "Alexandra: He gets his work done. He does.",
        "Gus: Mm-hmm. I just thought that's the way he got in trouble before. But you know, that's what you're saying, then I guess it's okay. Especially because the woman was Harley. That's who he was trying to buy drinks for and feed her oysters. But lucky for him, she's not a bimbo.",
        "Alexandra: Excuse me, gentlemen, but I think I'm getting a headache.",
        "Alan: And its name is Brad Green.",
        "Buzz: Come on, Ed, call.",
        "Alexandra: Buzz? What are you doing out here in the cold?",
        "Buzz: Well, I was sweeping up. And now I guess I'm looking at the stars.",
        "Alexandra: (Laughs) Beautiful, since it's completely clouded over.",
        "Buzz: Well, that's what makes it a challenge.",
        "Alexandra: Yeah. Buzz, what is wrong, for Pete's sake? You've... you've been like this for weeks.",
        "Buzz: Nothing's ever perfect.",
        "Marina: Are you trying to scare us? My grandfather isn't dangerous.",
        "Carrie: Then you must have been mistaken when you saw that cold look in his eyes.",
        "Marina: We gave them every chance to tell the truth.",
        "Carrie: Oh, my dear, when you were a tiny child and you did something wrong, broke a tea cup or spilled your mommy's perfume, your parents told you to tell the truth. Always tell the truth and everything will be forgiven. But you're a grown woman now. You know things are not that simple.",
        "Michelle: Hi. Sorry I'm late.",
        "Carrie: Are you sure you weren't followed?",
        "Michelle: Followed by who? My dad?",
        "Carrie: Well, he struck you. Following you would be child's play.",
        "Michelle: No, nobody followed me.",
        "Carrie: But you were on the phone with your father when I spoke to you.",
        "Michelle: I lied to him so he wouldn't see me leave the hospital. Ask me how I feel about it.",
        "Carrie: Michelle, I am not the enemy.",
        "Michelle: Well, that's the one thing I am not so sure about sometimes.",
        "Ed: Yeah, it's me.",
        "Buzz: Where is she?",
        "Ed: She's right across the street.",
        "Buzz: Great. Don't lose her.",
        "Ed: It's a little late for that, Buzz.",
        "Michelle: Look my dad was upset, okay.",
        "Carrie: And violent.",
        "Michelle: He lost control for a second, because I pushed him too far.",
        "Carrie: Oh, well, that explains everything. Maryanne must have pushed him too far the night that she died. It's always so convenient when you blame the victim.",
        "Marah: You know what? I hate this. I really, really hate this. It all started out so innocently. You know, \"Wish on some magic rings, Girls, and all will be well.\" Well, I still have a wish. And I want all of this to go away.",
        "Carrie: Which part do you want to go away? The part where Maryanne got into the car with your father, or the part where I told you about it?",
        "Marah: Either one would be convenient for me.",
        "Michelle: So where are the rings?",
        "Marina: Yeah, isn't Marah entitled to her wish?",
        "Carrie: Well, of course she is. But remember, these rings have great power and with power comes danger. So before you decide, think carefully about what you want and what you stand to gain and what you stand to lose. \u0091Be careful what you wish for' still applies. You might want to wish away that night, the car, the river. But what else might change? You father might never have married your mother. You and brother might never have been born. Ed might never have continued to be a doctor in Springfield. Buzz might not never have returned. Only one thing is certain. Change one thing in time, you risk changing them all.",
        "Marah: Well, I could still wish we never met you.",
        "Carrie: Yes, but what about the other wishes, the ones that came true? The ones from Marina and the ones from Michelle? Danny might still be mired in his own life, Shayne might be always confined to a wheelchair. Be careful. When you wish away the bad, you might lose the good.",
        "Marah: Then how are we supposed to help the people that we love? They're in agony because of stuff that we have stirred up.",
        "Marina: But you're blaming the wrong people.",
        "Marah: The car crash was an accident.",
        "Carrie: A cover-up was a choice.",
        "Michelle: But they thought it was their best choice.",
        "Carrie: They made that pact on the river bank that night. When they had comparatively nothing to lose. What choice would they make now when they have everything to lose?",
        "Rick: You would have been so proud, the man in charge, he was telling all the rest of the children what to do, he was completely a chip off the old Spaulding block.",
        "Beth: What did he say to you?",
        "Rick: He said, \"I'm going to be boss, just like my daddy.\"",
        "Beth: Yes, it's true, I was there, you should be very proud.",
        "Rick: But the kids, they were sick of it, there was this big overthrow your son is going to be quite the corporate kid some day, I hope.",
        "Beth: And I always thought it would be Lizzie to take over the company. But maybe they can work together. Wouldn't that be nice for a change? Like the Bauers.",
        "Rick: Oh, please, not the Bauers, we're not playing very well these days.",
        "Beth: What's going on?",
        "Rick: I don't know, my dad and Michelle are just, I don't know, I don't know what to say, I have no clue what's going on.",
        "Beth: You know, I saw Ed not too long ago, he seemed kind of lonely to me.",
        "Rick: He is lonely, but you know my dad, some of this loneliness is self- inflicted, he makes life difficult on himself and sometimes he throws that... Parents. What are we going to do? Some day our kids are going to roll their eyes at us just like we did with Alan and Lillian and my dad.",
        "Bill: Okay, Alan, maybe you didn't like this idea, but there will be others. In the mean time, keep this guy around, very smart, makes a great sounding board.",
        "Gus: I gotta say, it's not that I don't like the corporate life, I do, I quite like it. I miss my job, I miss solving riddles and putting the bits and pieces together, like your stolen car, for example.",
        "Bill: When did this happen?",
        "Gus: Oh, 30 years ago, but it was just recovered last week.",
        "Bill: Wait, the one they pulled out of the river?",
        "Gus: That's the one.",
        "Alan: I thought we had settled this.",
        "Gus: We did settle this, it's just that",
        "Alan: Then what's the problem?",
        "Gus: I looked into it a little further and turns out that you were the one that filed the police report. But there isn't a problem.",
        "Alan: I don't see a problem.",
        "Gus: There isn't a problem at all, I just find it interesting that you managed to forget the police report.",
        "Bill: Sounds like something my dad would have done back in his drinking days.",
        "Alan: I wasn't drunk, I just don't remember, that's all.",
        "Gus: It's fine, I believe you.",
        "Alan: Well, I hope we can put this to rest then. Gentlemen, I'm sorry, but I have to run. And thanks for the pen.",
        "Bill: Guess you touched a nerve, huh?",
        "Gus: Guess I did.",
        "Buzz: Ed, Ed?",
        "Alan: What's the matter?",
        "Buzz: Michelle might have met up with the letter writer, Ed was following her.",
        "Alan: Where?",
        "Ed: You didn't lose the connection, I hung up. Okay, look, guys, I can't do this any more.",
        "Buzz: Ed.",
        "Ed: No, I really can't. What do you want me to say? I quit. All right, I quit. I quit, I'm calling it quits!",
        "Alan: The hell you are!",
        "Eden: Tony, back off!",
        "Tony: Eden, you can't go to Bill with this.",
        "Eden: If I asked him directly if the mob was involved, Bill would tell me.",
        "Tony: Not if the answer was \u0091yes.' Forget his neck, he'd want to protect you. What you don't know cannot hurt you.",
        "Eden: And I refuse to believe that Bill is involved with the mob.",
        "Tony: What if he is, do you want to give him the heads up that we're onto it?",
        "Eden: And what if this is a setup? I'm just supposed to sit back and do nothing? That would suit you just fine.",
        "Tony: How many times do I have to tell you that I don't have to come between you and Bill to have you, okay? Forget it, that's not the point, the idea is to find out what's going on at Lewis. If you want to help Bill, I don't think you'd have a problem if the Shadow is wrong about it.",
        "Eden: You know I'll do anything to prove that.",
        "Tony: Okay, then you do what I tell you to do.",
        "Eden: Fine.",
        "Tony: Now, \"follow the crumbs,\" in my mind, means we have find out what's going on, we have to check the files, contracts, permits, personnel files, everything, we need to get in that office. You know, we don't, you do.",
        "Eden: You love this, don't you?",
        "Tony: I'm not playing games, Eden, I'm not. If the mob has gotten into Lewis, it's going to bite my cousin and I will not let him go down for something Bill did.",
        "Eden: All Bill did was try to help Danny get elected for mayor.",
        "Tony: You prove it, then. You start with the crew list, bring those to me, from that point I'll be able to tell who's connected, all right? Job one: find out where the personnel stuff is.",
        "Eden: I already know. It's in a storage room right off Josh's office.",
        "Tony: So you already know, get the keys.",
        "Eden: And how am I supposed to do that? They're in Bill's pockets.",
        "Tony: You call yourself such a Bad Girl, forget it. I will show you. Let's go.",
        "Brad: You see I've always preferred Vail over Aspen, that's why I bought my condominium there. It's very cozy, very private.",
        "Alexandra: Speaking of privacy, may I have a word with Mr. Green alone.",
        "Brad: Can't this wait?",
        "Alexandra: Of course not. It really can't, it's about the action on the slopes, you see it could be very dangerous this time of year, you could say avalanche season.",
        "Woman: Maybe I should go.",
        "Brad: Oh, well, good-bye. It was just a friendly conversation.",
        "Alexandra: Yes, and we know exactly how friendly you can be. I thought you and I agreed that you're requesting to fly low and avoid Alan's radar.",
        "Brad: I have done nothing to put myself in Alan's radar. I have learned my lesson. I have reconciled with Marie, and I'm a changed man. What's the matter, are you jealous?",
        "Alexandra: Oh, please. That was then, this happens to be now.",
        "Brad: Well, then, what is all of this about?",
        "Alexandra: This is about you buying drinks for Alan's once and future daughter-in-law, Harley Cooper.",
        "Brad: She's a friend. Period.",
        "Alexandra: If you really need a friend, darling, you just buy a hamster, they know how to run in circles. Now what did you tell her?",
        "Brad: Nothing. Although, I must say she was terribly interested in you.",
        "Alexandra: You didn't tell her that you and I were once... Oh, my God. Is there not one thing you can keep zipped up?",
        "Brad: I'm sorry, it just came out. There was no harm done, I assure you.",
        "Alexandra: We'll see. I can tell you one thing, though. If Alan finds out what we've been up to, I'm not the one that's going down, I guarantee you that.",
        "Beth: You know what would make this night perfect? If Mindy was here, right? We were the Four Musketeers. Wouldn't it be great to have her here?",
        "Rick: Yeah, but we should probably get going. It's getting late.",
        "Beth: Okay.",
        "Rick: I don't have to go anywhere if you don't have to go anywhere. Are you in a rush?",
        "Beth: No. I don't have to go anywhere. You're going to get better, Phillip.",
        "Rick: You have to get better. We need you to get better. A lot of people working.",
        "Beth: He's right. The kids miss you. And Alan. He's definitely not himself these days.",
        "Buzz: Stop this! Stop! It's a waste of time. You know where Michelle is, if there's even this much chance that she's meeting with the person who shoved Maryanne Caruthers in our face, you gotta tell us.",
        "Ed: This is a nightmare.",
        "Alan: Ed, where is Michelle?",
        "Ed: Fifth Street Museum.",
        "Buzz: That's where Marina lives. She could be there, they could all be there.",
        "Jeffrey: A little chilly for an open air discussion.",
        "Alan: Yes. We're just leaving.",
        "Gus: Better luck next time. You know, maybe Alan would prefer to have his Spaulding Pharmaceuticals shipped by dog sled.",
        "Bill: In some ways, I'm a lot like Alan. I don't give up and I don't take \u0091no' for an answer. See you around.",
        "Jeffrey: Hey. What's up with your old man?",
        "Gus: What do you mean?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, I can spot a guilty conscience at 50 yards, and something is eating away at your dear, old dad.",
        "Michelle: I just want to know how much more they're supposed to suffer.",
        "Carrie: That's entirely up to them.",
        "Marina: But they were young then, they made a terrible mistake and they've spent their entire adult lives with this secret.",
        "Carrie: At least they had an adult life, that's more than Maryanne ever had.",
        "Michelle: But they became good men and went onto raise families, heal the sick, give people food and shelter, build up the city.",
        "Carrie: And that makes up for their terrible mistake?",
        "Michelle: Yes.",
        "Carrie: Redemption is not a mathematical equation. Do any of these men seem at peace, do they seem in control of their lives? No. They can't wish away the past, any more than we can.",
        "Marah: Okay, then what am I supposed to wish for?",
        "Carrie: Wish that your fathers will find some way to redeem themselves, at least in their own eyes, before they are completely destroyed.",
        "(Noise)",
        "Carrie: Quickly, quickly.",
        "Bill: Well, this is an apology for not meeting me.",
        "Eden: I'm sorry. I didn't get your call until after I got home. I am so sorry, baby. I hate when we get our signals crossed.",
        "Bill: Are you all right?",
        "Eden: No. I am in love.",
        "Bill: Well, I don't know what to say. Maybe we should get our lines crossed more often. Something wrong?",
        "Eden: No. I'm tired of waiting. You believe in me, right? What we are to each other?",
        "Bill: More than anything in this world.",
        "Eden: Then that's all that matters. And nothing can hurt us.",
        "Bill: Come here.",
        "Jeffrey: Thank you, just what the doctor ordered.",
        "Gus: Thanks. Perfect. Just listen. My feeling is that Alan is just a little upset about his stolen car.",
        "Jeffrey: That thing was in the river for nearly 30 years. It can't be that important to a man like Alan Spaulding, right? Or can it?",
        "Gus: I wouldn't have given it a second thought to be honest with you, except for the fact that somehow or another he managed to forget that he filled out a police report.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, it was a long time ago.",
        "Gus: No, he's not the type of guy that would forget or forgive anybody for stealing something from him.",
        "Jeffrey: \"Not the type.\"",
        "Gus: What?",
        "Jeffrey: I'm just thinking about you, about your type. 100% Cop Type. Now you're working for Spaulding. I remember when I asked you, when you were on the force, if your partner ever committed a crime, whether you'd turn him in or not, and you know what you told me, you told me you would take him down. I think those were the words, \"take him down.\"",
        "Gus: Not a very good character trait. Maybe I should give a little more loyal to the people who --",
        "Jeffrey: It's just the wiring. Maybe we're wired the same way.",
        "Gus: That's not very comforting.",
        "Jeffrey: If a crime has been committed...",
        "Gus: That's where you and I differ. I never said --",
        "Jeffrey: I never said a crime has been committed, either. Alan Spaulding, somebody who is so scrupulously careful about protecting himself, he gets forgetful, it becomes mess, and I know that bothers you.",
        "Ed: Marina? Michelle?",
        "Alan: You fool! Why didn't you run in when you had the chance?",
        "Buzz: Where did they go?",
        "Michelle: This is where you live?",
        "Carrie: From now on, we'll always meet here. I think it's much, much safer. The rings first please.",
        "Marah: There are no clocks here.",
        "Carrie: There's no need for clocks in this room. In this room, time stopped, after that night on Cutter's Bridge.",
        "Michelle: You make it sound like some sort of a spell was cast.",
        "Carrie: Yes, you might say that, it is a spell. A spell that only you three can break.",
        "Marina: Next on Guiding Light...",
        "Danny: Bill, he's great, he's doing a great job, we're working really well together. Why?",
        "Tony: You trust him, Danny?",
        "Michelle: What are you going to do?",
        "Rick: I'm asking Dad to leave the hospital.",
        "Sandy: You hurt Marah, you answer to me."
