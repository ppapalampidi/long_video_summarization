        "Sharon drops in on Liam at the office and says his changes have meant so much and she just wanted to thank him. Bill walks in and says he has had enough. This day is over. He harps at Liam that the blackmail days are over. Liam will resign today as CEO. Bill will be back in charge. Rick cannot believe his mother that her marriage is over but he is glad she is home. Katie walks in and realizes too that Brooke is not wearing her ring. They all want to know what Bill did to cause this. Ridge and Steffy tell Ivy that they and Quinn appreciate her stepping up. Both are happy to hear that Eric has forgiven Quinn and himself as well. And both wonder how this leaves him with Brooke. He says her break with Bill is not temporary. She has taken off her rings and is not going back. But they both wonder what he could have done to make Brooke leave him so soon. Alone Katie tells Brooke that she can see she is in pain. Whatever it is she can tell her. Bill is the father of her child so she has a right to know what he did. She begs Brooke to tell her. Brooke brings up the fire and Katie does not want to believe it \u0096 Bill had something to do with the fire. Bill tells Liam that he is spunky and he admired that for a moment but that is over. Liam says this is no game and there is no blackmail, just call it karma. He wishes he had another father; one that would not destroy other people's lives. Bill smiles and says he regrets all that he has done but he will not sit idly by now and watch his first son run the company into the ground.",
        "Ridge tells Steffy that what Brooke needs now is a friend not someone who will pursue her and he would like to get the family back together. Katie goes berserk that Bill had the fire started and Sally could have been killed. Brooke admits that it scares her for Bill to do the things he does to get what he wants. Liam continues with his dad that he loved him, he respected him but then he constantly crosses the line. Bill says yeah there he goes - Liam the judge, jury and executioner. Liam says at least he is not the arsonist. Bill says he is not an unreasonable man. He is willing to meet Liam in the middle for the changes he wants to make. Liam confides in him that he bought the Spectra building and then gave it back to Sally. Bill about busts a gut and says oh he feels so much better now. Sally will never be able to pay him back. Liam says it was for restitution. Bill says enough is enough; he is taking the company back. Liam looks him squarely in the eye and says that is not Bill's call, it is his and he will call the police before he turns the company back to Bill. Bill picks up the phone and dares him to do that. Liam yells at him not to force him. Steffy bursts in and tells Liam that he is going off the rails and has to stop this. Liam starts to leave and tells Bill to go or he will call security. Bill tells Steffy that he's had it with his son. Brooke tells Katie that she never thought Bill would go this far. Katie says she is so sorry and hugs Brooke. Steffy tells Bill that what he did was wrong on so many levels but he does not deserve this and Brooke walking out too. Bill does not know how he is going to deal with all of this. She turns him around and hugs him and says he is not alone."

        "Sharon: [ Chuckles ] I'm still adjusting to the changes. And that's really why I'm here, because I just wanted to thank you so much. The benefit plan that you put into place, it's been the difference between night and day for my family. All the money that we put into co-pays and deductibles now can be routed into our college funds.",

        "Rick: Your marriage is over? I-I don't understand. What happened, mom? What did bill do?",
        "Brooke: He's just not the man that I thought he was or expected him to be.",
        "Maya: We're just -- we're sorry that you're hurting, brooke.",
        "Rick: And selfishly speaking, I'm just glad you're home.",
        "Brooke: Thanks, honey.",
        "[ Door opens ] [ Door closes ] Katie, I was gonna call you.",
        "Katie: Well, I wanted to come and check up on you in person. You're not wearing your rings.",
        "Ridge: How's the collection coming along?",
        "Ivy: Uh, yeah, good. I'll have some new pieces for you by the end of day tomorrow. I've been doing some interesting things with rose gold, so I hope you like it.",
        "Ridge: You've been putting a lot of hours in, and just know that it hasn't gone unnoticed.",
        "Steffy: Oh, yeah, we appreciate you stepping up.",
        "Ridge: So does quinn.",
        "Ivy: Well, I mean, it's no hardship for me. I love what I do. Speaking of, how are quinn and eric?",
        "Ridge: They're -- they're good. They're great.",
        "Steffy: Granddad's back to normal, so we're happy about that.",
        "Ridge: Yes, and I think we're gonna keep working on putting the family back together.",
        "Steffy: How do you mean?",
        "Ridge: Dad's forgiven quinn, and he's forgiven me, as well.",
        "Steffy: That's great, dad.",
        "Ridge: And the greatest news of all -- brooke has left spencer.",
        "Ivy: So brooke has ended her marriage to bill?",
        "Ridge: Walked out on him.",
        "Ivy: I'm stunned. I mean, this is pretty sudden. Wait, what does this mean for you and brooke?",
        "Ridge: Uh, maybe nothing. Maybe everything. Who knows?",
        "Ivy: Well, I'm gonna give her a call just so she knows she has my support.",
        "Ridge: I think she would appreciate that.",
        "Ivy: All right, well, are we good?",
        "Steffy: Yes, I can't wait to see that rose gold.",

        "Ridge: What?",
        "Steffy: Are you projecting? There something I don't know about? I thought the separation was temporary.",
        "Ridge: Nope. Brooke took off her rings, and she's back at her house.",
        "Katie: You two just got married. What did he do?",
        "Brooke: [ Sighs ]",
        "Maya: Well, I think it must be pretty serious.",
        "Rick: Well, it doesn't surprise me. I never trusted spencer to do right by you. I hoped he would, but in the end, bill always reverts to bill.",
        "Katie: What did he do, brooke?",
        "Brooke: Bill let me down in ways that I...never imagined.",
        "Liam: You know, you wasted your time coming here.",
        "Bill: That remains to be seen.",
        "Liam: You think you can bully me out of this chair?",
        "Bill: My chair.",
        "Liam: Not anymore.",
        "Bill: My chair, my office, my company. You will not blackmail me out of here. You will resign as C.E.O. Effective immediately.",
        "Steffy: That's what married couples do. They fight and they leave. Doesn't mean they're gone for good.",
        "Ridge: Well, you didn't see what R.J. Saw and what I saw. Brooke is done.",
        "Steffy: Well, if that's true, then I feel really bad for bill.",
        "Ridge: Once again with the sympathy for bill. Where's that coming from? Listen, brooke was into this relationship 100%. She wanted it to work. And now she's out, and why is that? What did bill do to make her leave so soon?",
        "Rick: Mom, I know that you're hurting, but you did the right thing. Spencer was never worthy.",
        "Maya: I am so sorry that these are the circumstances, brooke. But for what it's worth, we're really happy to have you back.",
        "Rick: Call us if you need us.",

        "[ Door closes ]",
        "Katie: I can see you're in a lot of pain.",
        "Brooke: It's just... upsetting.",
        "Katie: Ending a marriage. Yeah...it is.",
        "Brooke: [ Sighs ] I'm sorry. I know that you have your own feelings about this, too.",
        "Katie: What happened with you and bill, it's never been easy for me, but I really just wanted you to be happy. What did he do? You can tell me. What made you leave? Brooke, I have a stake in this, okay? He is the father of my child. I have a right to know what he did.",
        "Brooke: You committed arson?!",
        "Bill: I didn't light the match, but yes. I ordered it.",
        "Katie: Please. Please tell me.",
        "Brooke: [ Sighs ] Okay, yes, yes, you do have a right to know what he did.",
        "[ Sighs ] [ Sighs ] The spectra fire was just so... senseless. Such a tragedy!",
        "[ Sighs ]",
        "Katie: Yeah, it was, but what does that have to do with... with anything? Oh, my god.",
        "Brooke: [ Sighs ]",
        "Katie: Oh, my god. Are you telling me that he had something to do with that fire?",
        "Bill: You had your fun. Got a little spunky, asserted yourself. And I admired it. For a minute. But playtime is over.",
        "Liam: Playtime? You think this is a game? You think I'm playing chicken with you? Either you're fooling yourself or you're not paying attention.",
        "Bill: I will not be blackmailed by my own son.",
        "Liam: Don't think of it as blackmail, then. Think of it as karma. You just don't recognize it because it rarely comes for you.",
        "Bill: Karma. I will not be held hostage by you, liam.",
        "Liam: I wish I had another choice. In fact... I wish I had another father, one who wouldn't destroy people's lives over a vanity project, but, hey, you know, that's what you did, so here we are.",
        "Bill: And how long do you think I'm going to take this abuse?",
        "Liam: [ Laughs ] You're taking abuse?",
        "Bill: I've apologized over and over again. I said that what I did was wrong. If I could go back and change it, I would, but I can'T. All I can do is learn the lesson and move forward. I won't beg. This is my company. You might say it was my firstborn child. And I loved it, and I nurtured it, and I protected it and turned it into the powerhouse that it is today. And I will not sit home and watch you run it into the ground!",
        "Liam: Well, unless you're good with prison, you don't really have a choice.",
        "Bill: Really, son? You would do that? You would turn your own father into the authorities? Your own father?",
        "Ridge: I know you're in an awkward position. You want to make me happy, and you don't want to disappoint your father-in-law.",
        "Steffy: It's just hard to see the toll it's taking on him.",
        "Ridge: Okay. If you want to feel sorry for spencer, I'm not gonna hold it against you when logan and I get back together.",
        "Steffy: You really think that's gonna happen?",
        "Ridge: I don't know. But I-I do know that what she needs right now is a friend, not someone pursuing her. And then in the future, if we can work things out, then yeah, it'd be nice to have our family back together. Yes.",
        "Katie: Bill was responsible for the spectra fire? Oh, my god. Oh, my god. What happened? Did -- did he -- he ordered it? He -- he hired someone?! Brooke, this is outrageous! It's criminal! No -- no wonder you left! Someone -- someone could have been killed!",
        "Brooke: He said he made sure that nobody was in the building.",
        "Katie: Someone was in there! Sally went back, and she ended up in the hospital! She lost everything, everything she worked so hard for! She could have lost her life!",
        "Brooke: I know. I know. He just -- he didn't want to let her succeed. He wanted that land so badly to build his stupid skyscraper.",
        "Katie: This is unbelievable. This is unbelievable. Oh, my god! Brooke!",
        "Brooke: It scares me. It terrifies me to think the lengths he'll go to to get what he wants!",
        "Bill: How dare you? How dare you, after everything that I have given you and done for you?",
        "Liam: You think I want this?",
        "Bill: Yeah. Yeah, I think you do.",
        "Liam: [ Sighs ] I respected you. I looked up to you. Did I agree with you? No, hardly ever. But I figured there was enough space for both of us. You know, live and let live. Agree to disagree, that kind of thing. But then you crossed the line. You burned people out of their building, out of their livelihoods, and that's not okay. And you want to know what else isn't okay? Me letting you get away with it.",
        "Bill: [ Chuckles ] There you go. Liam spencer, judge, jury, and executioner.",
        "Liam: Yeah, well, it's a tough job, but somebody's got to do it. And hey, I'm already making some big changes. We got better benefits, we got environmental standards up to par. Hell, we even have parental leave.",
        "Bill: Why don't you just save yourself the time and light the money on fire?! How about that?!",
        "Liam: 'Cause I'm not the arsonist.",
        "Bill: I understand. I understand that you have felt, uh, marginalized and that i haven't been as respectful as i could have been.",
        "Liam: Yes, you were contemptuous and dismissive, but please, carry on.",
        "Bill: Some other things that I've done wrong. But moving forward, I'm not against everything that you want to implement. I'm willing to meet in the middle. I mean, reasonable men can compromise. But you cannot blackmail me out of my own company!",
        "Liam: Well, like I said, karma.",
        "Bill: Karma. What -- what is that? I mean, is that how you justify your behavior? Is that you sleep at night?!",
        "Liam: How do you sleep at night?!",
        "Bill: Like a baby!",
        "Liam: God, your stupid skyscraper! You just -- ooh, you wanted it so bad! You would do anything for that skyscraper! You would risk people's lives, wouldn't you?! Oh, by the way, speaking of which, I bought the spectra property, and I gifted it to sally.",
        "Bill: You think I didn't know that? Come on.",
        "Liam: Okay. Did you know she said she'd pay me back every penny?",
        "Bill: Oh, did she say that? [ Laughs ] That is -- that's great! I mean, I feel so much better now! This is stupid, liam! [ Scoffs ] Do you have any -- any idea how successful she would have to be to pay that balance off in full?! It's impossible! And it illustrates that you don't know what you're doing! You are in so far over your head!",
        "Liam: You seem to think it's an investment. It's not. It's restitution for the dreams you shattered.",
        "Bill: Restitution?! Resti-freaking-tution?! Will you put a tourniquet on your bleeding heart for just a second?! Do -- do you really not grasp how much money and time has been poured into spencer tower?! The only way to recoup that capital investment is if the tower goes up! But what do you want to do?! You want to throw more money at spectra, at this wannabe designer!",
        "Liam: Actually, dad, sally was making strides before you did everything you could to stop her. Absurd, ridiculous behavior, especially for a man who has so much.",
        "Bill: Okay, enough! Enough! I am taking control, and I am taking control now!",
        "Liam: You don't decide that. I do.",
        "Bill: All right, big man. Do it. Call the police. Do it. I dare you.",
        "Bill: I'm waiting, liam! Do it! Make the call!",
        "Liam: Don't force my hand!",
        "Steffy: I can hear you down the hall! What is going on?! What is going on?",
        "Bill: What's going on?! Calling your husband's bluff! You want to have me arrested?! Do it! Make the call!",
        "Steffy: Liam wouldn't do that to his father! Right, liam?",
        "Liam: Don't get in the middle, steffy.",
        "Steffy: I am in the middle! I'm trying to keep this family from going off the rails!",
        "[ Cellphone chimes ]",
        "Liam: I have to go.",
        "Steffy: [ Sighs ]",
        "Liam: If you ever barge into my office and start threatening me again, I'll have security throw you out.",
        "Steffy: No, bill! Stop! Stop, bill! Stop it! Stop!",
        "Bill: I've had it, steffy. I'm at my limit.",
        "Steffy: I know everything that happened. I know that brooke took off her rings, and I also know that your marriage is over.",
        "[ Sighs ]",
        "Katie: This is unthinkable. I can't believe that bill, even bill, would go this far.",
        "Brooke: Bill said he would never let me down, and i believed him. I thought I knew him. I thought I knew everything about him, and then he goes and does something like this.",
        "Katie: Bill has a way of making you believe in him. Even when you know you shouldn'T. I'm so sorry.",
        "[ Sighs ]",
        "Bill: You must have heard the latest from ridge. [ Chuckles ] Oh, yeah. He must be just loving this. Is this what I deserve, steffy? To lose everything?",
        "Steffy: What you did was wrong on so many levels. People are gonna react. But I know you regret it.",
        "Bill: I do. I know I messed up. Brooke walked out. My wife just...left me. I-I... I-I don't know how to or I don't know what... I just don't know what to do. I'm at a complete loss here.",
        "Steffy: Hey.",
        "Bill: I'm fine.",
        "Steffy: No, no. Hey.",
