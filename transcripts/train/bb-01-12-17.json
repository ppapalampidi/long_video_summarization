    "Recap": [
        "Eric springs it on Quinn and Ridge. He wants them to go to San Francisco, just the two of them since he does not have permission to fly yet. Both try to find ways out of it but Eric won't hear of it. He says the company needs this and so does the family. They need a chance to be together and it's only one hour away on the jet. Ridge tells Liam who thinks this is too good to be true. Ridge says he will not cross the line but this will work. He is involved, it is a both a blessing and a curse, he knows women. He makes a phone call and makes sure they change the room in SF to one room for a couple and it will include a complimentary breakfast. Liam thinks it is a hoot. Wyatt and Liam are going at it as usual when Thomas walks in, back from his long stay in New York. He says Caroline stayed behind but he is here to stay for a long while. He glances at the door with Steffy's CEO nameplate on the door and says some things change while others do not \u0096 looking at Wyatt and Liam. Steffy says she has moved into the loft but it won't be that long and she hopes to be back with Liam soon. Liam spars with Wyatt but adds if Quinn and Ridge can survive a trip to S.F. together then they two of them can do better. Eric tells Thomas his time will come. Right now because he has backed off on designing a little he needs Thomas to pick up the pieces and keep designing.",
        "Quinn is a little nervous. She tells Ridge she is not much of a public speaker and she feels like she is sweating. He says nothing bad is going to happen unless she wants it to, she is in control. Eric tells Steffy and Thomas that it is no secret that Ridge and Quinn do not like each other but he thinks they can make it through one meeting and one flight and she can show the world who she is. He trusts her. Quinn does well on camera and says this is the pinnacle of her career. Ridge takes over and says his showstopper wasn't for her but she made it a success. They do not really get along as they are two artists with different views who now are trying to mesh together their views. She repays the compliment by saying she is truly honored to be sharing the stage with the great Ridge Forrester."

        "Quinn: A design symposium?",
        "Ridge: And you want us to go?",
        "Quinn: Together?",
        "Eric: Yes. I know it's short notice, but they want you to be the guest panel. I think it's very important for Forrester creations to be represented up there.",
        "Quinn: Well, then, maybe Ridge should just go alone.",
        "Eric: No, I want you both to go.",
        "Ridge: It's all the way in San Francisco. You think I have time to just...",
        "Eric: The jet's ready. Take the jet. It's a one-hour flight. It's a simple overnight.",
        "Quinn: Uh, Eric, I don't think this is such a good idea.",
        "Eric: It's not up for debate. I insist.",
        "Ridge: This is silly. Hey, I'm not C.E.O. Why don't you send Steffy? Or you should go.",
        "Eric: This will be good for both of you. You need to get to know each other better. You two are family now. You need to start appreciating one another.",
        "Steffy: I don't know, it's a little embarrassing.",
        "Wyatt: Why is it embarrassing? You -- you're becoming a huge celebrity on social media. Millions of followers. This is only the beginning. I'm telling you, we're only starting to build your brand.",
        "Liam: Oh, you hear that, Steffy? You're a product now. Guess we can start boxing her up and shipping her out, right?",
        "Wyatt: It's a term everyone uses in pr, dummy.",
        "Liam: You are so L.A.",
        "Wyatt: Good! Thank you! That's a compliment. I love L.A.",
        "Thomas: And nobody loves L.A. more than me. Which is why I'm back.",
        "Steffy: Thomas! What?",
        "Thomas: I see some things have changed around here, ms. C.E.O.",
        "Steffy: Thank you.",
        "Thomas: And some things never change.",
        "Wyatt: Was that a jab?",
        "Eric: Your accommodations have been booked, the jet's ready. You need to leave ASAP.",
        "Ridge: And you didn't think you should run any of this past me.",
        "Eric: I appreciate your cooperation on this, Ridge. I think, uh -- I think this could be very good for our company. And I honestly think it'd be very good for our family, too.",
        "Quinn: Eric, why don't you come with us? We could make a little mini vacation out of it.",
        "Eric: The doctor hasn't cleared me to fly yet. Besides, I think it'd be good for you to just be alone together.",
        "Ridge: You know what, dad, you make a good point. You keep saying \"I changed\" and how you love this company, how you love my dad. This is your chance to show the world who you really are.",
        "Steffy: Mmm! So happy to see you.",
        "Thomas: Me, too.",
        "Liam: How was New York?",
        "Thomas: It was energizing, as always.",
        "Wyatt: Caroline and Douglas come back with you?",
        "Thomas: No, she wanted to spend some more time with her moms, so she hung back, and I came out on my own to see my sis, check up on her, and apparently new boss, by the way. How did you swing that one?",
        "Liam: Uh, that'd be a question for Eric and Quinn.",
        "Quinn: We do everything together. I don't want to go anywhere without you.",
        "Eric: I'll miss you every moment you're gone.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] But who's gonna make sure that you take your medication in the morning, or bring you your tea?",
        "Eric: I'm gonna be all right. I promise. Now, you promise to have some fun up there. I don't agree with much that Ridge says these days, but I do agree with this. This is a chance for you to show the world the kind of woman and designer you really are.",
        "Liam: San Francisco? With Quinn?",
        "Ridge: Yeah, it's my dad's idea.",
        "Liam: And it's just the two of you?",
        "Ridge: Yep.",
        "Liam: That's almost too convenient to be true.",
        "Ridge: He thinks it'd be a good idea for the two of us to spend some time together.",
        "Liam: Well, if that isn't ironic.",
        "Ridge: Tell me about it.",
        "Liam: So your plan -- it's happening. It's really happening. You're going through with it.",
        "Ridge: Yes, I am. Tonight.",
        "Liam: Uh, I mean, you and Quinn are speaking at a design symposium. Big audiences. Not a lot of alone time.",
        "Ridge: If I have to improvise, I'll improvise.",
        "Liam: What does that mean?",
        "Ridge: It means I will do whatever I have to do to get Quinn in a compromising situation.",
        "Liam: Well, within reason.",
        "Ridge: Yes, within reason. I'm not gonna cross the line.",
        "Liam: Oh, well, that's good, considering, you know, you're engaged to Brooke, and Brooke has no idea, and if she did, she'd be really ticked off...",
        "Ridge: Thank you very much for reminding of that. I got to think that if Quinn is out of our lives... Brooke would understand.",
        "Liam: Okay, but what if Quinn doesn't buy it?",
        "Ridge: There is no good way to say this -- I know women. It's a blessing and a curse. She will buy it.",
        "Liam: All right, but last week, you said that she was onto you and she was suspicious.",
        "Ridge: She likes danger. To her, I'm dangerous. Like a moth to a flame.",
        "Liam: What are you doing? Who are you calling?",
        "Ridge: Hi, uh, I'm checking on a reservation for Mr. and Mrs. Forrester. Yes, sir. We've got two rooms booked for this evening.",
        "Ridge: Two rooms? No. Wow. That's -- that's not right. It should be one room. Of course, sir. My apologies for the mistake. I've changed the reservation to one room only, and I'm including a complimentary breakfast for two. We look forward to seeing you soon.",
        "Liam: [Laughs] You -- you just put yourself and Quinn in the same hotel room.",
        "Ridge: And I got a compliment breakfast. All right. I got to go to the airport.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Quinn: I really don't want to go. Did I mention I have terrible stage fright?",
        "Eric: You didn't have stage fright in the showstopper. Everything's gonna be all right. Ridge will be there to take care of you.",
        "Quinn: [Scoffs] Can we video chat later?",
        "Eric: Yes, of course, we can.",
        "Quinn: Okay, well, there are salad fixings in the fridge, but you have to ask Linda to defrost some chicken.",
        "Eric: I can do all of that. I'm gonna be just fine. And you'll be terrific. You're gonna be my shining star.",
        "Quinn: I-I really don't like being put in this position. I -- what if I mess up?",
        "Eric: You're not gonna mess up. You're gonna be perfect. I promise you that.",
        "Quinn: I just don't want to let you down.",
        "Eric: You never have, you never will. There's nothing you could do to disappoint me.",
        "Quinn: Thank you. For always believing in me.",
        "Eric: I always will. Now, let's get you out of here. Come on.",
        "Quinn: I'll call you as soon as I land.",
        "Eric: Okay.",
        "Quinn: Eric? I love you, sweetheart.",
        "Eric: I love you, too.",
        "Thomas: And just when you're getting settled in my loft, I come in and I cramp your style.",
        "Steffy: Hey, it's fine. I'm not there that much anyway.",
        "Thomas: Cool, you won't mind sleeping on the couch.",
        "Steffy: Uh, first off, I don't do couches, thank you very much. I'm not doing that.",
        "Thomas: [Groans]",
        "Wyatt: [Sighs] Where'd you go? Got a text and you just took off.",
        "Liam: Uh, you know I used to work here, right? There are still people that value my opinion.",
        "Wyatt: Hey, Steff, we should look into getting rid of those people.",
        "Thomas: Oh, boy, I missed you guys.",
        "Liam: How long you in town?",
        "Thomas: You sick of me already?",
        "Liam: Yeah.",
        "Thomas: Yeah? I'm gonna be here for a long time.",
        "Wyatt: You and Caroline still trying to work things out?",
        "Thomas: Yeah. But you guys should see Douglas. He is huge, handsome. He's crawling around everywhere. It's awesome!",
        "Steffy: Oh, I miss my little nephew.",
        "Thomas: Well, they'll be back eventually, and hopefully, by then, you'll be moved out of my place.",
        "Liam: And hopefully moved in with me.",
        "Wyatt: Mm.",
        "Thomas: Where's dad? I've been trying to catch up with him for a while now.",
        "Liam: Yeah, he's on a flight to san Francisco. With Quinn.",
        "Wyatt: I just got a text from my mom. She said she and Ridge landed in san Francisco a while ago. That's an odd pairing, don't you think? Ridge can't even stand my mom.",
        "Liam: Uh, well, I guess Eric insisted they go together. It was his idea.",
        "Wyatt: Why?",
        "Liam: To mend fences? I don't know.",
        "Wyatt: Huh. That'll never happen.",
        "Liam: Yeah, you never what'll happen.",
        "Wyatt: I'm just surprised you didn't go to Eric's with Steffy and Thomas.",
        "Liam: What? No. Thomas just got back into town. They went to see their grandfather. Why would I go with them?",
        "Wyatt: Oh, I don't know, because you don't seem like you're letting Steffy out of your sight lately.",
        "Liam: [Groans]",
        "Wyatt: You know, you're always following her around, like a tracking device with your tacos and your soy lattes. I know what you're doing.",
        "Liam: Wyatt, I bring Steffy breakfast, and you're freaking out.",
        "Wyatt: You're trying a little hard, don't you think?",
        "Liam: Do you see her complaining?",
        "Wyatt: [Scoffs] You know, aren't you supposed to be working at Spencer? Doesn't Dad ever wonder where you are?",
        "Liam: Yeah, Dad doesn't keep me on the leash that he does with some people. Apparently, Eric's the one holding the leash, now, isn't he?",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] That's -- you're hilarious.",
        "Liam: Thank you.",
        "Wyatt: You know, I've just been so busy lately, making Steffy a star, that I just -- I kind of forgot how irritating you were.",
        "Liam: Listen, if your mom and Ridge can survive a trip to san Francisco together, I think you and I can do an afternoon.",
        "Wyatt: I just -- I think it's weird. Ridge and my mom? I mean, is that really a good idea?",
        "Eric: You and Caroline share a son. It'd be nice if you could work things out.",
        "Thomas: It's like I said. You know, we're giving it a shot, but we don't know what the future holds.",
        "Eric: Well, I'm pulling for you. You're both exceptional people. You're loving parents. You deserve everything life has to offer. I missed you.",
        "Thomas: I missed you, too. And Ms. C.E.O. right here. I missed you guys a lot.",
        "Eric: She's doing really well. You'd be proud of her.",
        "Thomas: I am proud of her. Although, I got to say, I'm a little disappointed. I feel a little overlooked.",
        "Eric: Your time will come. For now, I need you to keep designing. I've backed off a little bit. I need you to pick up the slack.",
        "Thomas: Can do.",
        "Eric: That's my boy.",
        "Thomas: Well, so, how's dad dealing with all of this? Steffy running the company and Quinn being so involved? He can't be, uh...",
        "Eric: He's not very happy.",
        "Steffy: That's putting it mildly.",
        "Eric: Unfortunately, he takes out a lot of his frustrations on my wife. It's been very hard on Quinn.",
        "Thomas: Yeah, why'd you send them to san Francisco together?",
        "Steffy: Yeah, Granddad. Quinn and Dad -- they bring out the worst in each other. I don't know if that was the best plan.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] [Clears throat]",
        "Ridge: Yeah, thank you. That's better. Thank you.",
        "Cyndy: Mr. and Mrs. Forrester, we're so grateful that you were able to attend on such short notice.",
        "Quinn: Thank you, Cyndy. Actually, um, I'm Mrs. Forrester, he's Mr. Forrester, but we're not married. I'm married to his father.",
        "Ridge: Quinn and Ridge will do.",
        "Cyndy: Right. Of course. I'm so sorry for any confusion. It won't happen tonight.",
        "Quinn: Oh, that's okay.",
        "Cyndy: Excuse me.",
        "Quinn: [Exhales sharply] If you two are all set, we're about ready to begin.",
        "Ridge: Ready when you are. Great, and I have the images you e-mailed over, Mr. Forrester. Let me go find someone to escort you to the green room while we load the audience in.",
        "Ridge: Cool.",
        "Quinn: Okay. [Quietly groans]",
        "Ridge: You okay?",
        "Quinn: Uh, yeah, I'm just -- I'm not much a public speaker. You know? [Clears throat] Am I sweating?",
        "Ridge: You look pretty.",
        "Quinn: Thank you. [Sighs] Those are a lot of seats. I hope they're all fans. You know, I do not know why I'm like this. I'm not normally this anxious.",
        "Ridge: You don't have to be anxious. Nothing bad's gonna happen unless you want it to happen. You're in control.",
        "Liam: What could possibly go wrong in san Francisco? I mean, it's not as if your mom's ever done anything to embarrass you or anyone else.",
        "Wyatt: Why didn't Eric send Steffy and me? I mean, we're -- we're amazing at public appearances. Why Ridge and my mom?",
        "Liam: I just told you. Eric is hoping they see each other in a new light.",
        "Wyatt: Must have been awkward. I mean, what would they do alone on a plane together? Play cards? Discuss the weather?",
        "Liam: I don't know, there's any numbers of things they could, um, do on the plane. Luckily, it's a short flight.",
        "Wyatt: You know, it's almost dinnertime. Steffy's probably not gonna be coming back to the office anytime soon, so...",
        "Liam: Why do you always assume that everything I do is about Steffy?",
        "Wyatt: Because you're obsessed with my wife! Key words -- my wife.",
        "Liam: Legally. Legally. But --",
        "Wyatt: But nothing. We are still married. I am her husband.",
        "Liam: Yes, until the divorce goes through.",
        "Wyatt: If it ever does! Thank you.",
        "Liam: [Sighs]",
        "Thomas: Oh, I'll never get used to this.",
        "Steffy: Neither will I.",
        "Thomas: Any updates?",
        "Eric: No, nothing since she texted that they've arrived. They're probably onstage by now.",
        "Steffy: Hopefully they don't embarrass you and go at it in public.",
        "Thomas: Yeah, as long as things don't get physical.",
        "Eric: No secret that the two of them do not get along together, but they're both adults, they're both professionals. This is business. They're representing Forrester. I'm sure they'll behave appropriately. Quinn would like nothing better than to get along with your father. I'm sure, after today, everything's gonna look different.",
        "Thomas: You seem hopeful.",
        "Eric: I am. I know my wife. I trust her. I think that, after today, she can prove to the world who she really is. And after that, she'll be welcomed with open arms.",
        "Steffy: [Sighs] I hope it goes well, but let's not forget who they are. They're both strong, passionate people. Hopefully, they can resist temptation, the urge to push each other's buttons.",
        "Quinn: I started off in downtown Los Angeles, making jewelry in a warehouse with a lot of help from my son. And it took years, but we built up our little business, and we were doing okay. We even had a few loyal clients. And that's when Forrester creations called. [Laughs] And I was blown away. I mean, to be designing for such a prestigious company, a company that was created by this extraordinary family, a family that I had been an admirer of for a very long time. I thought this was the pinnacle of my career. But it wasn't. It wasn't. Life just kept giving me gifts and giving me new challenges. I, uh -- I even took over as C.E.O. for a very short time when my husband fell ill, and, um...even though it was a difficult time, with the help and support of my co- workers and my family, I faced it head-on. I even had a little fun with it. [Chuckles]",
        "Ridge: You did. Right there. The jewelry pass. Yeah. That was fun. And you were wearing my showstopper. There it is. [Laughter] Fun times.",
        "Cyndy: You weren't a fan?",
        "Ridge: No. No. I wasn't a fan. I wasn't happy about that at all. But since we're being truthful, the two of us, we, uh -- we don't really get along.",
        "Quinn: Ridge.",
        "Ridge: Well, it's true. But here's the thing about two artists working together. Two artists will always have different visions. The tough part is working through it and making one vision that works for both. So, listening to your story tonight, listening to your journey and how you appreciate everything Forrester, it makes me realize I owe you an apology. The jewelry pass was a good idea.",
        "Quinn: Uh, Ridge, you don't have to --",
        "Ridge: It was a good idea. It was inspired, it was successful, and I didn't see it. And the showstopper wasn't designed for you, but... you were flawless.",
        "[Audience murmurs]",
        "Ridge: Anyway, I'm sorry. I'm using a lot of words to say something very, very simple. Quinn is a force to be reckoned with. There.",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles] Thank you. Uh, thank you all so much. I was so honored to have been invited to be here with you all today. And as a proud member of the fashion community, I feel welcomed and I feel truly accepted. [Chuckles] Just like everybody in this room, I have worked so hard my whole life, creating and doing what I love to do, and -- and it's really a dream come true to be representing Forrester Creations today. And to be sharing the stage with such a brilliant designer as Ridge Forrester.",
        "[Applause]",
        "Ridge: [Thinking] Tonight, it all ends for you, Quinn."
