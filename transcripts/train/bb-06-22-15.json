        "Wyatt holds Steffy and she says do not say he is sorry. He says he is not sorry that he kissed her. Quinn spies on them. Steffy can not believe that Liam married Ivy. Wyatt says it is only a ploy to keep her in the country. Steffy says knowing how Liam is he will try to make the marriage work and that could take years. Liam asks Ivy what did the immigration officer want. Before she answers Quinn knocks on the door and says she was in neighborhood and needed Ivy's advise. She tells Liam that she is impressed with him, a regular thing, he stepped up and rescued Ivy again. And she is glad she could help in some small way with Carter. Liam gets a call from FC and has to go. Ivy tells him to go, she will see him later. Ivy confesses to Quinn that she doesn't have to be married to Liam or be deported now. Turns out she was right all along, she does have dual citizenship. Ivy says Liam needs to know the truth. Quinn says that is the last thing she needs to tell Liam. Katie kisses Bill and he laments that she should know by now that Bill does not get blindsided. Rick's reign as CEO is over. He gets a call but tells the guy he wants this piece to be given to Liam, the one with Steffy back at FC. He fills her in that he thinks Wyatt is setting himself up for a heartbreak with Steffy. Things sometimes work out better the second time around. Wyatt explains to Steffy that she has been gone and in the meantime Liam fell in love with someone else. She says she refuses to go down that road again. Wyatt says there are other avenues like himself. Liam walks in as Wyatt hugs Steffy. Liam tells her that he needs to talk to her alone so Wyatt leaves. She still can not believe it \u0096 Mr. and Mrs. William Spencer, that should have been them.",
        "Wyatt answers the phone and asks Bill to what does he owe this pleasure. Wyatt tells Bill that his other son went and got himself a wife. He had to marry Ivy to save the day and keep her from being deported. Liam is telling Steffy right now and he needs to go pick up the pieces. Katie tells Bill that looks like he did get blindsided. Ivy says she has to tell Liam. Quinn asks if she loves him. Ivy says yes. Quinn tells her this mistake could happen again. She is having the life she always wanted and married to a man she adores so all she has to do is be quiet and not screw it up. Liam has been with Steffy more times than she can count and she does not deserve another chance. Liam says this situation has got him very confused. She says he told Ivy it was for show but it really isn't. He is married and he loves her so that has to count and she will not do this again. Liam says it took the risk of losing Steffy again to make him understand his feelings for her, so he can not lose her again. She says he did, the moment he said I do. If he loved Steffy then he would not have married Ivy. He pulls the old excuse that she left town after she lost her baby on her. Yes he did that. Given the situation he doesn't know what he is doing but he thinks this is fixable and needs her to tell him that she wants it too. She wants to believe him, but she can not do this, different girl but same situation. She tells him go home to his wife so he leaves. Bill fumes and tells Katie that Liam will use any excuse to jump into a phone booth and be the hero. Quinn tells Ivy don't cave in so easily. She gives her a bracelet and Ivy gives it back. Quinn gives it back and says she can have it all, just do not say a word to Liam. Wyatt returns to find Steffy and she says the marriage is real and the sad part is that she just wants Liam happy but she does not want to share him with another woman, especially one that is his wife. Liam goes back to Ivy and says he is sorry he had to go to FC. He had to see Steffy but they did not get to finish their talk so what does she need to tell her. He won't let the officer intimidate her. She keeps hearing Quinn's words reverberating in her mind that she is not to tell Liam."

        "Liam: Ivy? What happened? What did the immigration guy say?",
        "Wyatt: I, um --",
        "Steffy: No. Please don't say you're sorry.",
        "Wyatt: For kissing you? Oh, I'm definitely not saying sorry for that. [Chuckles]",
        "Steffy: I can't take another sorry from a Spencer right now.",
        "Wyatt: I mean, I could always go by fuller.",
        "Steffy: [Sighs]",
        "Wyatt: So...",
        "Steffy: I just still can't believe it.",
        "Wyatt: I know. I know.",
        "Steffy: How could he do it? How could Liam marry Ivy?",
        "Bill: I told you. I knew we'd close them before the meeting even began.",
        "Katie: Yeah, just like you knew that you would set Rick off enough that he would clock you at the Forrester meeting.",
        "Bill: Played that sucker like a violin. When are you going to admit that dollar bill doesn't get blindsided?",
        "Katie: Mm. How's that for being blindsided?",
        "Bill: Better than a punch in the mouth.",
        "Katie: You know, if you consulted with me, then no one would have punched you in the mouth -- Rick or anyone else.",
        "Bill: Bottom line is Rick's reign as C.E.O. Is over. And besides that...",
        "Katie: What's this?",
        "Bill: I do consult with you.",
        "Katie: You decided to switch manufacturers.",
        "Bill: Why do you sound so surprised? I value your insight.",
        "Katie: Thank you.",
        "Bill: You're welcome. Let's do some more of that kissing.",
        "Katie: [Chuckles]",
        "Steffy: Ha! Married.",
        "Wyatt: Yep.",
        "Steffy: Liam and Ivy.",
        "Wyatt: I think it's pretty badass of him, actually, skirting the law to save the girl. But don't worry. It's just a ploy to keep her in the country.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, but for how long? They're gonna have to keep it going for, what, years? God! Years.",
        "Wyatt: Years. [Clears throat]",
        "Steffy: And you know the kind of guy Liam is. He's gonna wind up trying to make the marriage work.",
        "Wyatt: Mm-hmm.",
        "Steffy: The reason why I love him so much.",
        "Wyatt: I know Liam, too. And if he felt the same way that you do, he wouldn't have married Ivy.",
        "Liam: What did the agent want? He had our paperwork.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, he had all of our paperwork all right. [Chuckles] Liam, there's something I really have to tell you.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Liam: [Sighs] Uh, no, I'll get it. Oh, what do you want?",
        "Quinn: Ivy? Hey, Ivy. Oh! There you are. I was in the neighborhood --",
        "Liam: Malibu? Really?",
        "Quinn: As a matter of fact, I was. I was going over these designs, and I needed your opinion. But of course, now that you're not going back to Australia, I-I guess I could have waited.",
        "Liam: [Sighs] Forgot you know, too. Great.",
        "Quinn: Well, of course I do. We work together. I saw the paperwork the agent dropped by. Do you really think that ministers just show up with wedding dresses out of nowhere? Although I have to say I'm very impressed with you, Liam. You really stepped up. Ivy was in trouble, and you rescued her yet again. This is becoming a regular thing, right? Like, you're -- you're like a rescue ranger. But I guess it just goes to show how much you love Ivy. And I do feel really good that I was able to help in some small way, you know, with Carter. He was so good at our wedding.",
        "[Cell phone beeps]",
        "Liam: It's Forrester.",
        "Ivy: Uh...yeah. Go. Get it. I can talk to you when you come back.",
        "Liam: Really? Are you sure?",
        "Ivy: Yeah.",
        "Liam: Okay. I'll see you later.",
        "Ivy: [Sighs]",
        "Quinn: What's wrong? Honeymoon over already?",
        "Ivy: I can't get deported.",
        "Quinn: I know. Because you married Liam. Aren't you glad you listened to me?",
        "Ivy: No, I don't need to be married to Liam. I can't be deported at all. set it up. No. I want Liam to do it.",
        "Bill: Yeah, good. Set it up. No. I want Liam to do it.",
        "Katie: Do what?",
        "Bill: An exclusive on Steffy being back at, uh, Forrester. I want Liam to do the sit-down.",
        "Katie: [Sighs]",
        "Bill: Along with a bottle of wine and a porterhouse.",
        "Katie: Oh, come on! Tell me you're not playing matchmaker again. He's committed to Ivy.",
        "Bill: You sound like Wyatt.",
        "Katie: What are you talking about?",
        "Bill: Seems that Wyatt is somewhat interested in Steffy.",
        "Katie: [Sighs] Seriously? Really?",
        "Bill: I told him he's setting himself up for heartbreak.",
        "Katie: Because you think Liam's gonna go back to her?",
        "Bill: He was never happier or felt more alive. It was one adventure after another. And besides, things have a way of working out better the second time, wouldn't you agree?",
        "Katie: Like I said, Liam's committed to Ivy.",
        "Quinn: So, he confesses his love for Steffy in front of you, loses her again, and then tells you that he wants to give your marriage a go. It's classic Liam.",
        "Ivy: Quinn, can you just -- can you not right now, please?",
        "Quinn: I'm sorry.",
        "Ivy: So, that's when the immigration officer came over and told me that there's been a huge mistake.",
        "Quinn: A mistake?",
        "Ivy: Turns out I was right all along. I do have dual citizenship.",
        "Quinn: No!",
        "Ivy: Yeah, I don't have to be married to stay here in the states.",
        "Quinn: And that's what you were about to tell Liam when I walked in?",
        "Ivy: Quinn, he needs to know the truth.",
        "Quinn: Uh, the truth is overrated. That's the last thing you should do.",
        "Ivy: [Scoffs]",
        "Wyatt: It's okay to be upset with Liam. What he did for Ivy was great, but it totally shafted you. He had to have known that. And look -- I know it's hard for you to hear, but you've been gone. He fell in love with someone else.",
        "Steffy: He wants to make it work.",
        "Wyatt: With Ivy.",
        "Steffy: With me.",
        "Wyatt: Really?",
        "Steffy: He says the marriage isn't real and doesn't have to change anything.",
        "Wyatt: You tell him to go to hell?",
        "Steffy: I refuse to go down that road again.",
        "Wyatt: Huh. You know, there are other avenues. Maybe it's time to get a new map. Hmm?",
        "Steffy: [Chuckles] Can you not --",
        "Wyatt: No? [Chuckles] Come here. [Chuckles]",
        "Liam: Steffy? [Clears throat]",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, so, we were just talking, and it's kind of a lot right now.",
        "Liam: Oh, thank God you're here.",
        "Wyatt: Relax.",
        "Liam: Hey, Steffy, I need to talk to you. Alone.",
        "Wyatt: Realize you have no right --",
        "Liam: Don't.",
        "Wyatt: Okay.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Steffy: So? Where's the missus?",
        "Liam: Steffy, don't --",
        "Steffy: You know, I still can't believe it. Mr. And Mrs. Liam Spencer. That should have been us.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] To what do I owe the pleasure?",
        "Bill: Hey, just, you know, checking in. Uh, I had a few minutes, wanted to see what was going on.",
        "Wyatt: Check in or check up? Wait, am I on speaker?",
        "Katie: Hi, Wyatt.",
        "Wyatt: Hi, Katie.",
        "Bill: Uh, did you do what I said? Did you find yourself a date? Need me to make a reservation for you? How about I let you borrow the jet? Just give me her name, uh, for the flight plan.",
        "Wyatt: I don't have a date. But I do have some news. Your son went and got himself a wife.",
        "Katie: What?!",
        "Bill: Wait, what are -- what are you talking about? You?!",
        "Wyatt: No. Liam. Turns out Ivy doesn't have U.S. Citizenship and the government found out. They say that she's working at Forrester illegally and she has to go back.",
        "Katie: So, he married her?!",
        "Wyatt: Saved the day. [Chuckles] We should have video chatted, 'cause, man, I wish I could see the look on your faces. Well, I'm gonna go, because Liam's breaking the news to Steffy right now, and I should be there to pick up the pieces. So...",
        "[Beeps]",
        "Katie: How's that for being blindsided?",
        "Ivy: So, I-I shouldn't tell Liam?",
        "Quinn: What do you think?",
        "Ivy: Oh, Quinn! It's stunning.",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles] It's yours. Consider it a wedding gift.",
        "Ivy: Ugh, this marriage isn't -- I have to tell Liam.",
        "Quinn: Do you love him?",
        "Ivy: Yes, of course I do.",
        "Quinn: Does he love you?",
        "Ivy: He loves Steffy. He's only married to me so I don't get deported.",
        "Quinn: Yeah, but that could happen again.",
        "Ivy: No, because the agent came here --",
        "Quinn: The same agent that told you you were here illegally? He can come back again and say, \"oops, sorry. I made another mistake.\" I mean, come on. Look. You're living the life you always wanted. You're -- you're living right here in L.A. You're working at the family business, designing jewelry, married to the man that you adore. Yes, I-it happened a little quickly, but just -- just be quiet. Don't screw it up.",
        "Ivy: Quinn, Liam needs to know.",
        "Quinn: Liam needs saving from himself. He's been with Steffy more times than he should have. It didn't work out before. It isn't gonna work out again. You are Mrs. Liam Spencer.",
        "Steffy: What do you want from me, Liam? I can't keep doing this.",
        "Liam: I don't -- I don't know what I want. This whole situation's got me really...confused. Listen, I have to tell you something. Um... when you left earlier, Ivy asked me if we could at least try to make the marriage work.",
        "Steffy: What did you say?",
        "Liam: I told her we could try. Because -- because you were done with me, Steffy. That's exactly what you said.",
        "Steffy: No, no, no, no, no! One of the reasons that I came back to los Angeles was to tell you that I wanted you. I made that very clear, but I will not be second to your wife.",
        "Liam: The marriage was for show. It was for show.",
        "Steffy: It's not for show anymore. You just told her that you're willing to try to make it work.",
        "Liam: Okay, so tell me I made a mistake. Tell me that.",
        "Steffy: Do you love her? That's what I thought.",
        "Liam: I love you. I love who we are together. I love what we share, and I spent a very long time lying to myself about that. Do you know what it took? It took this false marriage. It took the threat of losing you for good for me to realize that. But I still care for Ivy, and I don't want to hurt her, so I need to know where you stand.",
        "Steffy: Why? You already told her that you're gonna try to make it work.",
        "Liam: If there's a chance -- if there's a chance, I can't do this. I can't lose you again.",
        "Steffy: You already did the moment when you said, \"I do.\" It shouldn't have happened in the first place, because if you really wanted me, you wouldn't have married Ivy.",
        "Liam: Okay. [Chuckles] Okay. I didn't want to have to turn this around on you, but you have to understand, Steffy. You left. We were married, and we were going through something very difficult and very sad. We lost a child, and you left. I was devastated. I had to swallow all of those feelings down just so I could move on.",
        "Steffy: Mission accomplished.",
        "Liam: Until you came back. And you started telling me that you still loved me. And I tried to hide those feelings. I tried to do right by Ivy. But how can I deny this? How can I deny what we bring to each other, who we are together? Yes, did I tell Ivy that I would try to make the marriage work? Yes. Yes, I did that, but frankly, I don't -- I don't know what the hell I'm doing, and can you blame me, really, given this situation? Here's what I believe. Here's what I believe. I believe that this is fixable. I believe that we deserve our chance, but I need to hear it from you, Steffy. I need to hear you say that you want that, too. So, tell me you want that, too.",
        "Steffy: That's what you do. You fix things. I want to believe you, Liam. You know what you mean to me, but I can't keep doing this -- different girl, same situation, going back to right where we were. I can't. So go to Ivy. No. You shouldn't even be here. You're married. Go.",
        "Liam: Give me something. Give me a sign, and I will figure it out.",
        "Steffy: You can only tear up marriage papers so many times to convince me. Go home to your wife. Oh, my God. [Sighs]",
        "[Crying]",
        "Bill: No answer.",
        "Katie: I cannot believe Liam married Ivy.",
        "Bill: Oh, any chance to jump into a phone booth, put on his little cape.",
        "Katie: But it's such a big step!",
        "Bill: You were just saying how into each other they are.",
        "Katie: Sure, to be dating, a budding relationship, not to get married, a lifelong commitment. I mean, my God. He's so impulsive. He always wants to save the day.",
        "Bill: Look, he wouldn't be married to Ivy if he didn't have to be, not with Steffy around.",
        "Ivy: Yes, I may be Mrs. Liam Spencer, but once he finds out that he doesn't have to be --",
        "Quinn: Give it back.",
        "Ivy: What?",
        "Quinn: Uh, it's nothing personal. I made a mistake.",
        "Ivy: [Scoffs] Look, he has to know what's going on. He cares for me, yes, but he wants to be with Steffy, Quinn.",
        "Quinn: Don't cave in so easily. You guys were together before all this happened. Help him see why. Don't just hand him over to Steffy. Here. Take it. The next time I ask for it back, you say...?",
        "Ivy: No. It's mine.",
        "Quinn: You can have it all if you really want it. Just -- just don't say a word to Liam.",
        "Wyatt: [Clears throat] Went that well, huh?",
        "Steffy: He says the marriage isn't real. You know the sad part? I just want him to be happy. And it's obvious that he's not. But I won't compete for him again.",
        "Wyatt: Steffy, you shouldn't have to compete with anyone.",
        "Steffy: Thank you. Thank you. And...I don't want him. Not anymore. I won't share him with another woman, especially not his wife.",
        "[Door opens, closes]",
        "Liam: Hey. Quinn gone?",
        "Ivy: Yeah.",
        "Liam: No more surprise visits from immigration? Good. [Sighs] Sorry. I had to run to Forrester.",
        "Ivy: Did you see Steffy?",
        "Liam: Yeah. Uh, so, we never finished our conversation earlier. Uh, you were gonna tell me what the agent wanted. Is that something I should know? Ivy? Hey, just so you know, if they're threatening you, they can't do that, okay?",
        "Quinn: You're Mrs. Liam Spencer.",
        "Liam: Ivy?",
        "Quinn: You have everything you've ever wanted.",
        "Liam: Ivy what is it? What do you need to tell me?",
        "Quinn: Just keep quiet. Don't screw it up."
