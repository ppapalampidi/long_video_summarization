Nicole asks Maya why is it that she seems not to trust her. Everything seemed fine until she needed a place to stay and now Rick's house. Maya says Nicole has always judged her but let's face it now she'd like to get in on the action too. Nicole says he is happy for Maya and they should do as Rick says, relax and enjoy each other. Maya says she has worked hard for this. They have been separated for a lot of years, so why now. Quinn tells Wyatt that Quinn can whine all she wants to but there is nothing she can do to break up her and Deacon. Brooke tells Deacon she can not believe he proposed to that monster. He says he will leave, he is glad Brooke is all right. Brooke says no, he came over for a reason. She is concerned. He says her men are running low. Bill has gone back to Katie and Ridge is now with Caroline but that will be over and she will end back up with Ridge. She assures him she won't. He asks if there is any chance at all for the two of them. She says she can see what Quinn does to people and she does not want that to happen to him. She hopes he will listen to her. Quinn is really dangerous. He says this is all unnecessary and there is nothing else she can say. He advises her to go to bed and no more drinking. She says there is nothing to celebrate so she won't be drinking. But she does and remembers what Deacon said that Brooke has always dazzled him. It was Brooke that shut the door and then he found Quinn. Deacon returns and takes the drink out of her hand. She says it is just one little drink and she is fine so he leaves her alone."

        "Brooke: You and Deacon are not getting married, Quinn.",
        "Quinn: We don't need your permission.",
        "Brooke: I won't allow it!",
        "Quinn: You don't have a damn thing to do with it, Brooke!",
        "Brooke: You are not listening to me. There will be no wedding! You will never be Mrs. Deacon Sharpe.",
        "Deacon: So, Quinn's with Brooke?",
        "Wyatt: You didn't see mom at the house?",
        "Deacon: No.",
        "Wyatt: Okay, well, you must have just missed her, 'cause she said she was heading over there.",
        "Deacon: All right, look. Maybe she changed her mind, okay, turned around. Hey, maybe she didn't even go.",
        "Wyatt: Ha ha! Oh, I'm sorry. Was that not a joke? Look, I hope she wasn't looking for a fight, but she said she was heading down there to share the happy news.",
        "Aly: You want me to give up my room?",
        "Nicole: I don't want to put anyone out.",
        "Rick: No, you won't be. There are plenty of other rooms in the house.",
        "Ivy: Exactly. There are a lot of other rooms in this house.",
        "Rick: But Nicole is our house guest, so she should be getting one of the better ones.",
        "Maya: For the time being. It won't be long.",
        "Nicole: Thank you. That's really kind of you. I'm so grateful.",
        "Rick: Nicole stays. It's settled.",
        "Ivy: Oh. Is it?",
        "Rick: Aly?",
        "Aly: Um...I...",
        "Rick: I think we're gonna need some more snacks.",
        "Aly: Snacks.",
        "Rick: Yeah, we've got company. Are you hungry?",
        "Nicole: I guess I could eat.",
        "Rick: Great. Some drinks, too.",
        "Ivy: I'll help you.",
        "Maya: Look, Rick, I-I appreciate you welcoming my sister into the house. But we need to talk before she moves in.",
        "Wyatt: You told Brooke you and mom are engaged, right?",
        "Deacon: Yeah. She wasn't too happy.",
        "Wyatt: How not happy?",
        "Deacon: You're worried.",
        "Wyatt: No. Yes. Yes, I'm very -- I don't know. All I know is she left here in a great mood.",
        "Deacon: You know the last time your mom was with Brooke she slapped her, right?",
        "Wyatt: Yes, I do.",
        "Deacon: All right, listen, uh, you stay here. If your mom comes back, you text me.",
        "Wyatt: Okay.",
        "Quinn: You don't get it, Brooke. Deacon's not wrapped around your little finger anymore.",
        "Brooke: He won't marry you.",
        "Quinn: Yes, he will. You heard him. I heard him. He's moved on. He's committed to me. And there isn't a thing that you could say or do to keep us from making it official.",
        "Quinn: You don't get to decide who I marry.",
        "Brooke: It won't be Deacon.",
        "Quinn: Where do you get off trying to undermine my relationship? He told you we were engaged.",
        "Brooke: Oh, he told me a lot more than that -- how you feel about yourself, how you think you don't deserve him.",
        "Quinn: Yes, but I have him. And you can't stand that. You lost your hold on him just like you lost your hold on Ridge, on bill.",
        "Brooke: I left town so bill and Katie could have another chance.",
        "Quinn: So bill gets to be happy but Deacon doesn't?",
        "Brooke: Not with you. You would ruin his life the same way you ruined Hope's.",
        "Quinn: Oh, yes. Oh, drag Hope into this. [Chuckles] You know, forget about all your men, all your affairs, all your marriages. Throw Hope in my face, and automatically you're, what, morally superior to me? I made mistakes with Hope. I did things that I deeply regret, but I am not the cause for all of her problems. Having a mother like you, being your badge of shame.",
        "Brooke: Get out.",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles] Look at what you made me do.",
        "Brooke: I said leave!",
        "Quinn: Yo-you made this all ugly. I-I didn't come here to argue with you. You say you care about -- about Deacon. Why can't you be happy for him? I mean, this is a celebration. We should make a toast.",
        "Brooke: I am not going to drink with you.",
        "Quinn: Why not? I mean, you were drinking before I got here. Why not keep the party going, huh? I mean, from what I understand, this is a regular thing for you these days.",
        "Brooke: Oh, my God. That is none of your business.",
        "Quinn: Really? Well, my marriage to Deacon is none of your business. This wedding is gonna happen, and it's gonna be huge -- wine, dancing, dinner, flowers -- the works.",
        "Brooke: Nobody will show up.",
        "Quinn: Mm. Maybe not. But I'm gonna do it anyway. And unlike you, this is it for me. I mean, you probably can't remember all of the weddings that you've had, but, see, this is going to be my one and only -- my one walk down the aisle, to have and to hold, no doubts, no do-overs, my one man. Deacon is the only man for me, and I'm the only woman for him. Got that? Cheers. So... you stay out of our way and everything's gonna be fine. But you interfere, you get between us in any way, shape, or form, and you're gonna have to answer to me.",
        "Aly: Seriously?! What just happened? So -- so Maya's sister shows up, and all of a sudden, I have to move out of my room?",
        "Ivy: No, Aly. You are not going anywhere.",
        "Aly: I-I can't say no.",
        "Ivy: Well, you have to say something.",
        "Aly: In front of Nicole? That would be rude.",
        "Ivy: Rude?",
        "Aly: Yeah.",
        "Ivy: Really?",
        "Aly: Yes.",
        "Ivy: Rick is giving orders and pushing you around. He knows quite well that Eric won't kick us out of this house, so he's trying to make us leave. We have every right to be here as he does.",
        "Aly: Sure we do. But if Rick's the only one making the rules --",
        "Ivy: This is -- this is ridiculous.",
        "Aly: And really annoying, but it -- it's not Nicole's fault.",
        "Ivy: No, you're -- you're right. It's not. She doesn't know what Rick is thinking. And to be honest, I don't think Maya does, either. Did you see her face? I think she was just as shocked as you were.",
        "Nicole: Are you saying you don't want me here?",
        "Maya: That is not what I said.",
        "Rick: No, it's our pleasure.",
        "Maya: But there is a way to do things. Just showing up like this?",
        "Rick: It's fine. I'll handle everything. I know you two haven't been close, but maybe this time together will help you form a new bond.",
        "Nicole: I'd like that.",
        "Rick: And don't worry about Aly. The room near the kitchen is super convenient.",
        "Maya: For making snacks?",
        "Rick: Relax. Enjoy your sis.",
        "Nicole: Thank you, Rick. I won't be a problem.",
        "Rick: Of course not.",
        "Maya: Rick, can I have a moment alone with Nicole?",
        "Rick: Sure. I'll check on Aly and Ivy. I mean, how long does it take to fill a bowl with chips?",
        "Maya: What is this? What are you up to, Nicole?",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Brooke: Oh, Deacon.",
        "Deacon: Is Quinn here?",
        "Brooke: She just left.",
        "Deacon: You okay?",
        "Brooke: Well, she didn't slap me this time.",
        "Rick: How's it coming with those snacks? What?",
        "Ivy: Are you -- are you serious? Having Maya's sister move in?",
        "Rick: She's sleeping on a couch in somebody's dorm. She needs a place to stay.",
        "Aly: My room?",
        "Rick: I think you can give it up for a little while.",
        "Ivy: Well, why would she?",
        "Rick: Do you have a problem with this?",
        "Aly: You didn't even ask me, Rick. You just announced it.",
        "Rick: I was trying to be polite. And I expect the both of you to do the same.",
        "Ivy: Oh, really? We're not the ones acting like we --",
        "Aly: Look, I'm not -- I'm not saying I won't do it. It just would have been nice to have been part of the decision.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, and I actually -- I think Maya thinks the same thing. I mean, it might have just been from where I was standing, but she didn't seem overjoyed about her sister moving in to this house.",
        "Nicole: What do you mean? I'm not up to anything.",
        "Maya: One minute, you stop by announced, the next, you're living in my house?",
        "Nicole: Rick's house.",
        "Maya: Is that what this is about? You needed a place to crash?",
        "Nicole: I wanted to see you. I gave you my number, and I hadn't heard from you.",
        "Maya: And it's just a coincidence that the issue of your living arrangements came up again.",
        "Nicole: Rick asked me about it. Why are you acting like you don't trust me?",
        "Maya: I feel like I'm getting mixed signals from you.",
        "Nicole: What kind of signals?",
        "Maya: Your attitude. Everything seems fine, we're getting along, and then...I don't know. You bring up Rick's marriage to Caroline, seeing me in the tabloids, my job as a model. What was it that you said? You don't think I have a future?",
        "Nicole: I didn't mean it like that.",
        "Maya: You might not have come out and said it, but... I can feel you judging me, Nicole. And even just now -- \"Rick's house\"? You might not like the choices that I've made, little sister, but let's be honest -- you wouldn't mind getting in on the action.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Quinn: Wyatt. You didn't leave.",
        "Wyatt: I was waiting for you. So, how was Brooke's?",
        "Quinn: Oh, don't worry. I didn't hit her. But, boy, did I want to.",
        "Brooke: Oh, I can't believe you proposed to that monster!",
        "Deacon: You know what? I don't want to get into this again, all right? I don't. Wyatt said that Quinn was on her way over here. I just wanted to check.",
        "Brooke: You wanted to check to see if I was okay, right? I mean, is that the kind of relationship you want to be in for the rest of your life?",
        "Deacon: If you're all right, I'm gonna leave.",
        "Brooke: No, I-I'm not all right. What are you talking about? Can't you see? Nothing is right here, Deacon!",
        "Deacon: Quinn isn't perfect, okay? I get it. Okay, but she doesn't pretend to be, and when I'm with her, I don't have to pretend, either. It means that I've got a shot of actually being a good husband, a good father.",
        "Brooke: Oh, my God. You are not gonna have kids with her, are you?",
        "Deacon: [Sighs] Good night, Brooke. I'm glad you're all right.",
        "Brooke: Wait, wait, wait. [Sighs] I-I'm scared, okay? I'm really worried, and obviously you are, too. Otherwise, you wouldn't have come over here.",
        "Deacon: You've always known how I feel about you. You've always known what you meant to me.",
        "Brooke: You mean a lot to me, too.",
        "Deacon: Look --",
        "Brooke: That's why I'm concerned.",
        "Deacon: I get that this is a weird time for you, okay? I-I get that, you know, bill's back with Katie and -- and this is a guy that you -- you know, you had planned on building a life with. You know, you were devoted to him. Before that, there was Ridge, and now he's doing whatever the hell Ridge is doing with Caroline. But believe me when I tell you this -- that will end. When it does, you'll go back to him.",
        "Brooke: I won't.",
        "Deacon: Brooke, it's not gonna last.",
        "Brooke: I won't go back to him.",
        "Deacon: What -- what are you saying? Are -- are you saying that there's a chance for us?",
        "Rick: Maya and Nicole haven't seen each other in a long time. This is a chance for them to get to know each other better.",
        "Aly: And I think that's wonderful.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, me, too. But you and Maya aren't the only two people who live in this house. There should have been a discussion.",
        "Rick: About what?",
        "Ivy: Uh...",
        "Rick: Nicole is a guest, and we are gonna show her the hospitality and the manners that Forresters are known for. You will make her feel at home. End of discussion.",
        "Nicole: I'm sorry.",
        "Maya: You admit it.",
        "Nicole: Maybe I was judging you a little.",
        "Maya: You're jealous.",
        "Nicole: No.",
        "Maya: You're here because you want a part of all of this.",
        "Nicole: I told you -- I want to be with my sister.",
        "Maya: In her Beverly hills mansion.",
        "Nicole: Anywhere! I don't care where you live or who you live with. Don't get me wrong. All of this is awesome.",
        "Maya: I've worked hard for it. I have earned it. Rick and I both have. We are finally getting our reward.",
        "Nicole: That's great. I'm happy for you. Rick's obviously crazy about you. He must be to ask your little sister to move in.",
        "Maya: Temporarily.",
        "Nicole: Right. So let's do what he said -- relax and just enjoy this time we have together.",
        "Maya: And that's the only reason you're here?",
        "Nicole: Is that so hard to believe?",
        "Maya: We've been apart for so many years. Why do you want to be with me now?",
        "Nicole: Because I love you, Maya.",
        "Maya: I love you, too.",
        "Wyatt: She said she won't let you marry Deacon?",
        "Quinn: Oh, no, no, no, no, no. She forbids it.",
        "Wyatt: Well, what is she gonna do?",
        "Quinn: Nothing. She can whine about it all she wants. There is no way she's gonna come between me and Deacon.",
        "Deacon: What are you saying? Are you saying there's still a chance for us? I mean, is that what all this concern is about?",
        "Brooke: No.",
        "Deacon: No? There was a time when I wanted that more than anything in this world. I used to think about all the great times that we shared together. I thought about what it would mean to Hope if we got back together.",
        "Brooke: I know.",
        "Deacon: And then I proposed to you. You turned me down. I'm sorry that it disappoints you to see me with Quinn.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] It's not just that. I-I've seen what Quinn can do to people, and I don't want something like that to happen to you. You have to listen to me. Quinn is trouble.",
        "Deacon: [Chuckles] Well, lest ye forget, so am I. I mean, all the things that people have said about Quinn, they've said about me.",
        "Brooke: No. No, this is different. Quinn is really dangerous.",
        "Deacon: Brooke, I appreciate your concern. It's nice. It really is. But it's unnecessary. I mean, it's not helping make this easier, not for anyone.",
        "Brooke: So there's nothing more that I can say?",
        "Deacon: No. Good night. You should go up to bed. I'm gonna go home to Quinn. And please, Brooke, no more of this, all right?",
        "Brooke: [Chuckles] Yeah. [Clears throat] A drink's the last thing I need, actually, because there's nothing to celebrate.",
        "Deacon: Okay.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs]",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Brooke: Oh, geez. [Groans] Hmm. [Sighs]",
        "Deacon: You dazzle me. You always have. You know that. I mean, you -- you represent the ideal woman to me. Always out of my reach except for that one shiny moment, and I have tried so hard to recapture that. And I can't because it's not what you want. You don't feel the same way. And you shut the door. And I found Quinn.",
        "Deacon: I knew it.",
        "Brooke: [Gasps]",
        "Deacon: What are you doing? You said you wouldn't drink.",
        "Brooke: What are you doing? My goodness, it's a little drink. That's it. It's nothing. Okay. Okay. No, I'm fine, okay? No more alcohol. I mean it. Just go on home to your little...fianc\u00e9e. Deacon. I'm fine. Really. Just go. [Chuckles] I'll be fine. Go on.",
        "Deacon: Okay.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Brooke: [Sighing] Oh, God. [Sighs] [Sniffles]"
