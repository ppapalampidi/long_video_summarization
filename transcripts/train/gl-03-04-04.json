        "Alan's emotional universe begins to implode as his past and present mistakes catch up with him. Gus returns home to Harley and tells her what happened at the fairgrounds all those years ago. As he confides in Harley, Gus recalls an intense confrontation he had with Alan in the church regarding the drowning of Maryanne Caruthers. Harley and Gus realize the difficulties of being loving parents as Gus wrestles with the fact that if he does not turn Alan in, he himself becomes an accessory. Alan visits Phillip at Ravenwood to apologize for his many parenting mistakes. However, Phillip is bitter off his encounter with Olivia and portrays a \"stick it to them, before they stick it to us\" attitude. Reva comes to see Josh at the police station and is happy to have a turn playing anchor for him. Reva's trust twists like a knife in Josh's heart. He urges her to focus on Marah instead. She questions him about his anxiety for her, and he covers. However, when Reva seemingly sees the ghost of Maryanne beckoning to her with urgency, she catches Josh's sense of worry for their child and rushes off."

    "Transcript": [
        "Harley: No, frank, he has been out all night. (Crying) and that's not like him! He calls. He calls me ten times a day. He calls to see if I'm happy. I'm worried about him. Send a squad car, because someone is about to be murdered. Where have you been?",
        "Gus: I'm sorry.",
        "Harley: Where have you been? And it better be good because i could strangle you!",
        "Gus: I give up, babe. I give up.",
        "Harley: What?",
        "Gus: Or I guess, you know, because that's all really there is left to do, to guess. Or speculate. Or, you know, go on the truth. But then again nobody... nobody says the truth anymore. So I don't know. I don't know.",
        "Harley: Please stop. I don't understand what you're talking about. What are you saying?",
        "Gus: This is about my father and your father and an innocent girl who died a very long time ago.",
        "Nurse: Medication time, mr. Spaulding.",
        "Phillip: Pills again. Yum.",
        "Nurse: You know these will help you feel better.",
        "Phillip: So they say. Any visitors? My father maybe?",
        "Nurse: Your wife has taken care of everything. Anyone who's not on her list isn't allowed to visit.",
        "Phillip: Olivia. My better half. Olivia, my loving wife... till death do us part. (Baby crying) it is you.",
        "Olivia: Please don't make me regret what I did.",
        "Josh: Hey.",
        "Reva: Tired?",
        "Josh: I'm doing okay.",
        "Reva: Oh. No sleep?",
        "Josh: No. (Laughter) not much.",
        "Reva: Me neither. I was here about an hour before visiting hours just waiting.",
        "Josh: I'm sorry about that. I'd like to get out of here actually. Have you talked to ross at all?",
        "Reva: Well, it seems that jeffrey o'neill is dragging his feet. Nobody seems to know why.",
        "Josh: What about marah? Have you checked on her like i asked you to do?",
        "Reva: She's fine.",
        "Josh: Yeah, I'm just worried about her that's all. I think the focus right now should be on her not so much on me.",
        "Reva: Hey, you're the one who's sitting in jail for shooting some lunatic. Marah is fine.",
        "Josh: I just want you to keep an eye on her. What?",
        "Reva: What is it you're not telling me?",
        "Josh: I'm sorry.",
        "Reva: Joshua, don'T.",
        "Josh: No. I really am sorry. I've let you down. I've let everyone down. I can't believe that after what happened with shayne's accident, I'm actually putting the family through this right now. It's terrible. It's despicable.",
        "Reva: Stop it. Would you stop it? I'm the one picking up the slack now, okay? It's my turn. And you know what your job is?",
        "Josh: Getting out of jail would be a good start.",
        "Reva: Can I admit a little something to you? It's really kind of nice to know that you're capable of making mistakes, too.",
        "Josh: Yeah, well... (laughs) I have most definitely made some world class mistakes in my time, but what happened at the fairgrounds, shooting that woman was not one of them. Reva, I believe with all my heart that lives were saved. Obviously, I didn't go to fairgrounds intending to take a life.",
        "Reva: Of course not.",
        "Josh: But the fact is, I did. And if I hadn't, others-- maybe even me, myself, others would have died. So I don't think of it as a mistake. I did what I did and I would do it again.",
        "Reva: Well, you don't lie. You say you acted out of self- defense. End of story.",
        "Olivia: Hi.",
        "Marah: Hi.",
        "Olivia: I heard what happened with your dad. I'm sorry. Would you like to sit and maybe have a cup of coffee for a second?",
        "Marah: Sure.",
        "Olivia: I was actually going to give this sam, but, you know, he's not good on caffeine. (Light laughter) this must have been very difficult for all of you, you know. But especially you. You and josh are very close.",
        "Marah: Yeah. It's just... it's hard for me not to be able to help him. You know, he's the best dad. He's always put shayne and me first.",
        "Olivia: Yeah, I remember. Oh, gosh, he used to just drive me crazy, make me so jealous. (Laughter)",
        "Marah: Yes, I remember that.",
        "Olivia: I know. I know. But like I've since realized that you have children, your life changes. They come first. They always do. And you have to do everything in your power to try to protect them.",
        "Marah: I'm sorry that you lost your baby, olivia. I am. It's an awful thing that shouldn't have to happen to anybody. I was surprised when aunt cassie said that you are actually going to stay in springfield though.",
        "Olivia: It's my home, you know. I have good memories here. And, besides, I don't know where else we would go.",
        "Marah: Who's we?",
        "Olivia: Phillip and I.",
        "Marah: Right. Phillip. Well, that's good. That's good that you have each other, because it's difficult to go through things alone.",
        "Olivia: Phillip and I are very lucky.",
        "Phillip: I don't even know who you are. I never did. (Laughs) or maybe... maybe I did. Maybe I did.",
        "Alan: Son?",
        "Phillip: Father!",
        "Alan: I hope it's all right dropping in on you like this. I needed to see you.",
        "Phillip: You needed?",
        "Alan: Yes. I've been talking to gus most of the night and the only thing i wanted after talking with him was to see you. I hope this is all right.",
        "Phillip: I'm not kicking you out.",
        "Alan: Tell me something. Do you believe in redemption? In making things right?",
        "Phillip: That's the story of my life, isn't it?",
        "Alan: Well, it hasn't been the story of my life... until now.",
        "Harley: Our fathers? And a dead girl?",
        "Gus: It's a cold case that jeffrey o'neill tipped me off on. It's either manslaughter or murder or reckless endangerment. Depending on which version of the truth you really want to buy into. But whatever, it's all tied into the josh lewis case.",
        "Harley: And the woman that he shot?",
        "Gus: And your father's involved as well.",
        "Harley: No. My father was at the fairground, but he didn't have anything...",
        "Gus: Your father is involved with the entire thing.",
        "Harley: So your father and my father were involved in something together? That's not possible. And josh, too? It doesn't make any sense. I don't buy it.",
        "Gus: Baby, I was with alan all night. He bared his soul to me in my mother's church. That's where I found him. You talk to god later. Right now you deal with me.",
        "Alan: Who are you? Michael the archangel of judgement?",
        "Gus: Maybe I am. But at least we know who you are now.",
        "Alan: Let me guess.",
        "Gus: What do I have to do to get a straight answer out of you? Do I have to take you to the back of this church and give you a beaten till I get what i want? Because the problem is I'm libel to keep going even after I get what I want!",
        "Alan: Sounds like you have a problem.",
        "Gus: Yeah, we have a problem. We have a problem. It's funny I should find you here, huh? What? Last stop when all else fails you drop to your knees.",
        "Alan: I've made some terrible mistakes in my life. You're sounding like a man who hasn't ever made any.",
        "Gus: I've made plenty of mistakes, alan. But yours my friend is a whopper. Jeffery o'neill has you in a car, certain jaguar that we've talked about several times. He's got you going off cutters bridge. It was an accident that killed a young girl. And apparently her aunt--",
        "Alan: Yes, it's true.",
        "Gus: What does that mean yes, it's true? What does that mean?",
        "Alan: It means I won't deny it anymore. That I cannot deny it. I know you didn't expect that answer from me. You expected me to come up with some story that you could believe and still love me after you heard it.",
        "Gus: Were you there when josh shot caroline caruthers?",
        "Alan: Yes.",
        "Gus: Were you there when that girl died in the car back in the day?",
        "Alan: Yes. It was my car. I was driving. I am responsible and I have been running ever since.",
        "Gus: I talked to you about that car. I told you that I knew it was your car. You knew. I asked you for straight answers back then. You remember?",
        "Alan: And you expected that i would give you one.",
        "Gus: What do you think? That I'm just one of those stupid people that you can just lie to anytime you want to? That I'm the gullible idiot son looking for a father? Is that what you think?",
        "Alan: No. You're a son who deserves a better father.",
        "Gus: Yeah, well, don't remind me. Why you got to lie to me?",
        "Alan: I was hoping we would get through all this. And everything would calm down. That we could continue hiding the secret for another 30 years.",
        "Harley: They were all part of a cover-up.",
        "Gus: You don't seem that surprised.",
        "Harley: I don'T... I don't know what I am right now.",
        "Gus: The young girl died a long time ago. An innocent girl. Basically alan killed her. And now a few days ago another woman is killed at the fairgrounds and whether josh lewis pulled the trigger or he didn't, I don't really know. But it's basically the same thing. Alan basically killed her as well.",
        "Harley: (Stuttering) are you saying that my father's involved in all of this? How? And alan told you how? Alan told you this?",
        "Gus: Alan has no reason to lie anymore.",
        "Harley: (Laughs)",
        "Gus: He doesn'T.",
        "Harley: Well, then I guess you'd better tell me.",
        "Phillip: So what did you do this time?",
        "Alan: That's my son.",
        "Nurse: I'm sorry, sir, you're not on the approved visitors list.",
        "Phillip: Hey, this is my father. It's all right.",
        "Alan: Thank you.",
        "Phillip: There's something that you wanted to say.",
        "Alan: I wanted to say to you that I'm sorry.",
        "Phillip: For what?",
        "Alan: For all of it, phillip. From your childhood all the way through your relationship with olivia. For your entire life. And today I want to start and make amends.",
        "Harley: You're saying that my father and alan were involved with this girl who died?",
        "Gus: Yes.",
        "Harley: How?",
        "Gus: You know, honey, I've tried to protect you from a lot of things since the day we got together. You really...",
        "Harley: If you were trying to protect me, you wouldn't have mentioned this in the first place. Now you're just stalling. Gus, I already know that my father is involved in something, okay. I already know that my father is so scared about something that he wants to leave town, okay. So I think I'm ready to hear this horrible, terrible thing that my father did.",
        "Gus: Oh, really. How about murder?",
        "Harley: No, that's not possible. You didn't say murder. You said that alan was involved in reckless endangerment is what you said.",
        "Gus: They were both involved in the death of a girl and they didn't want anybody to know.",
        "Alan: Buzz, billy, josh, ed and myself. We're all to blame.",
        "Gus: What were you people thinking?",
        "Alan: We weren't thinking. We were young. We actually thought we could hide what had happened.",
        "Gus: And that everything would be fine if nobody found out the truth?",
        "Alan: Well, it's gotten us by so far. I mean we've gone and lived our live-- lives we would have never been able to live if we had...",
        "Gus: If you came forward, right, like men. But you didn't do that. Especially you because you had too much to lose, right? Why? Was it your idea? Your car? You were driving?",
        "Alan: Yes.",
        "Gus: And so the girl was dead. You figured, so what she's dead. Nothing we can do about it.",
        "Alan: Yes.",
        "Gus: That's sick.",
        "Alan: It was an accident.",
        "Gus: That's a human life.",
        "Alan: Not murder. It wasn't a murder.",
        "Gus: And you don't get to be judge and jury, okay. Even though that's a role you've been playing for your entire life.",
        "Alan: Well, what are you? An impartial and fair jury of my peers? No, gus, you're my son.",
        "Gus: Please don't remind me. All this time. All this rubbish you've been feeding about when to be a better man, about being the father that I never knew. Well, here you are. And even worse than I could ever imagined.",
        "Harley: My father left someone to die?",
        "Gus: Well, alan says that they tried to rescue her, but they couldn'T.",
        "Harley: It doesn't matter. They didn't even bother to tell anyone about it.",
        "Gus: No. No, they didn'T.",
        "Harley: I didn't know what this was. I mean I knew that it was bad, but I didn't know... I didn't know that...",
        "Gus: You didn't know how badly they screwed up?",
        "Harley: This goes beyond screwing up. They let someone die. An innocent girl. Or, they killed her. Because what do we know. Really, I mean they've been lying to everybody. They've been lying to all of us. They've been lying to you and shayne and marah... they've been lying to everybody. And now everybody's lives are turned upside down. And that poor girl has died. For what? These stupid men! This has to end.",
        "Gus: Oh, it's about to.",
        "Marah: Thank you for the coffee.",
        "Olivia: Sure.",
        "Marah: I hope everything works out for you, olivia. I really do. I know we haven't always had an easy time of it. And well, I'm older now and i guess I realize how complicated life can be sometimes. And I know that I was hard on you when you were with my dad. I'm sorry.",
        "Olivia: You were. Don't worry about. I'm okay. Things happen for a reason, right?",
        "Marah: Do they?",
        "Olivia: Well, we have to believe that, or it's hard to go on. Tell your dad I hope everything works out okay.",
        "Marah: I will. Thank you.",
        "Josh: Thank you for believing in me.",
        "Reva: I know who you are. And all those times you stood by me. I hate this. All of it. So much. But I'm glad to know that I'm here to finally to be able to return the favor.",
        "Josh: Well, the best thing you could do for me right now would be to get on ross to get me out of here.",
        "Reva: And go see marah?",
        "Josh: Yes, not necessarily in that order.",
        "Reva: I will give ross a call.",
        "Josh: What is that? A picture of the kids?",
        "Reva: No. No, it's a cold case that jeffrey asked me to do some work on.",
        "Josh: You can get an image or vision or whatever it is just by looking at a picture?",
        "Reva: Not all the time. It usually depends on how strong the circumstances are. And this particular woman's death were... it was pretty intense circumstances.",
        "Josh: Want to tell me about it?",
        "Reva: I'd rather--",
        "Josh: Reva, what's wrong?",
        "Reva: What? I just wasn't sure...",
        "Josh: What?",
        "Reva: Nothing. I was looking for something.",
        "Josh: In your phone book. Ross' phone number.",
        "Reva: Right.",
        "Josh: You know, don't worry about that right now. He can wait.",
        "Reva: Wait? You've been talking about how long the arraignment's taking.",
        "Josh: I know, I know. I just... I want you to find marah and just check on her, okay? Please?",
        "Reva: Okay.",
        "Josh: I love you.",
        "Reva: I love you, too.",
        "Phillip: You're apologizing?",
        "Alan: Yes, phillip. I'm apologizing to you for the way that I have treated you. I haven't been a good father to you. I think you know beyond a doubt that I loved you very much. But I have pushed you in the wrong direction, son, because i had to control you.",
        "Phillip: Yes, you did.",
        "Alan: Yeah. I never accepted you for the way you really were. I gave you some latitude, but i never let you stray too far. I mean, you had an incredible gift for writing, but I squashed that, because I wanted you to be who I thought you should be.",
        "Phillip: Because you required certain things.",
        "Alan: Yeah. Well... who cares what i thought? I wasn't in my right mind. I was just doing what my father did to me, turning you into what I thought you should be. I ruined your wonderful relationship with beth because i thought she would make you weak.",
        "Phillip: Yeah. You took away everything that was good.",
        "Alan: I'm not even supposed to be here now. Olivia's banned me from seeing you.",
        "Phillip: No parent should be separated from their child.",
        "Alan: I kept you from seeing your parents, and that was wrong.",
        "Phillip: So you're here to say that you're sorry and make it right?",
        "Alan: I can't change the past. I can only start now to make up for the things I've done. I hope it's not too late, phillip.",
        "Phillip: Alan, relax. I'm still here. I survived.",
        "Alan: Do we still have a chance? Can I make this up to you? Phillip:(Laughing) alan, don't be so hard on yourself. You were right all along. You were. All those years when you kept telling me and warning me and trying to teach me, you were right. I just didn't want to believe you. That's how I ended up here, because I didn't listen. I should have, and now I'm paying for it.",
        "Gus: I was just hoping that alan would prove everybody wrong about him, you know?",
        "Harley: Yes. That he would be the kind of father that you always wanted.",
        "Gus: Yes. No. I would settle for a halfway decent man. Are you kidding?",
        "Harley: You know what? He probably thinks he is.",
        "Gus: Yeah, well, he'd be wrong.",
        "Harley: And you're blaming yourself for that? Uh-uh. You gave him a chance. And if alan blew it, no matter how much you hoped he wouldn't, that's his problem.",
        "Gus: It's more than that, baby. It'S... it's the holiday time. Look at all the time we spent together. How much macaroni and cheese can two people eat? All the time that we spent bonding and cozying up to each other, father and son, and all the working side by side at spaulding, I mean... I don't know. You know, it was just too good to be true. And nothing really works out that perfectly.",
        "Harley: You know why it didn't, don't you? Because he's alan spaulding. Because nothing in his universe is ever what it seems.",
        "Gus: Maybe that's it. I just wanted it to be different this time.",
        "Harley: I know you did. I know you did. I love that about you. And I would expect nothing less.",
        "Alan: This is exactly how i expected you to react. I know that you are going to do what you feel is right.",
        "Gus: Yeah. And you're going to let me do that? Come on, please. You're not that naive.",
        "Alan: I will have my lawyer contact the district attorney.",
        "Gus: Jeffrey o'neill is not going to deal with you, alan.",
        "Alan: Everyone's looking for a better deal, just waiting for the right offer. And deals are what I do best.",
        "Gus: Weasel out of things is what you do best. Is that what you mean?",
        "Alan: Maybe you should stay out of this. I don't want you to get hurt in all this mess.",
        "Gus: Do me a favor, will you? Stop pretending like you're concerned about you and me. Maybe you're just thinking i could be useful, a cop as a son. Yeah, a cop as a son. Especially when a homicide comes to light and you're involved in it. Is that it? I'm looking pretty useful to you right about now?",
        "Alan: I would never use you that way.",
        "Gus: Oh, please.",
        "Alan: You are just the latest victim caught up in all of my terrible choices that I have made in my life, running trying to hide the past. Well, I've got to stop all of that. Because if I don't, if i continue...",
        "Gus: Alan, you are only coming clean because you've been caught! That's what guilty people do!",
        "Alan: Yes, and they pay for the crimes. And I have been paying.",
        "Gus: You have been skating, my friend.",
        "Alan: What do I have to show for it? Look at my life.",
        "Gus: Well, if I was to look at your life, I'd see a pretty\u00d1i empty one.",
        "Alan: Gus, my future is in your hands. Maybe, just maybe, you can give me what I've been unable to give myself.",
        "Gus: Can you believe that?",
        "Harley: Okay, do not let alan do this to you.",
        "Gus: What am I supposed to do?",
        "Harley: You're supposed to let jeffrey build a case against alan.",
        "Gus: Don't you get it, honey? I know everything now.",
        "Harley: So? So that makes you an accessory after the fact.",
        "Gus: Maybe that's it. How do you like that, me and my old man going down together for murder?",
        "Harley: No. No, no, no, no, no. You are not going to jail.",
        "Gus: No, I'm not going to jail. I'm not going to let him drag me down like he dragged everybody else down, just because I know his secret. Tucking secrets into the files, into the folders of your life, alan. That's what you do, man. You know, your life is in my hands? Please. Please.",
        "Alan: Gus, you know how to do the right thing better that i do.",
        "Gus: What are you, a sociopath now? Oh, you don't know right from wrong, alan? Or are you too soft to make a real decision? Make up your mind. First, you said stay out of it, then you're telling me to turn you in. What is it?",
        "Alan: I don't know. I don't know anymore. I just know that I'm scared. I feel like running, running where no one will find me. But I owe you the truth.",
        "Gus: No, you don't owe me anything. You're just too bogged down with guilt to get off the mat. That's your problem.",
        "Alan: All right, fine. Whatever. Do your job.",
        "Gus: Well, no. I'm sorry. That doesn't work for me, either. You see what you're doing? You've made me now... you have made me an accessory after the fact. See, the only way I can save my hide is to skin yours. Now you're forcing my hand.",
        "Alan: No, no, no. This is cut and dry, that's all.",
        "Gus: What, it was an accident? You weren't alone in the car? You didn't mean to do it?",
        "Alan: No, I didn't mean to do it.",
        "Gus: You didn't mean to do it?",
        "Alan: You're starting to sound like my lawyer.",
        "Gus: I was in the fbi, alan. I am a lawyer. Look, you're going to pay for this one way or the other, and the law's going to make sure of it. I just don't know how yet. So until that time, why don't you take care of your family?",
        "Alan: You are my family.",
        "Gus: End we're finished. You know, you wanted a shot at being a decent man. Well here's your shot. Don't blow it.",
        "Alan: Too late. I'm too late.",
        "Phillip: You always taught me to stick it to them first, and you were right.",
        "Alan: No, I was wrong. I thought I was right, phillip.",
        "Phillip: Maybe if I'd been tougher on lizzie from the beginning, not coddled her so much...",
        "Alan: Phillip, elizabeth is a very sick little girl. She's very confused.",
        "Phillip: Well, maybe she would have been stronger if i had tried to make her more the way you wanted me to be.",
        "Alan: You've got all of this backwards, phillip. Don't you see? You are the good and decent man. You have this big heart, and that intimidated me. That's why I had to control you.",
        "Phillip: No, alan. I am who I am because I didn't listen to you. I'm broken and beaten. Can't you just accept that you were right?",
        "Alan: No, because it will be the death of both of us. Don't you see, son? I am finally learning what you have been trying to teach me all these years.",
        "Phillip: How to lose?",
        "Alan: How to start living my life without anger, without regret.",
        "Phillip: The point, alan, is to survive. All of the rest of it, all of the... my fantasy about a noble life well lived, that's meaningless.",
        "Alan: Oh my god, son, what have I done to you?",
        "Phillip: You've set me free.",
        "Josh: Reva, I know that look. You've seen something. What?",
        "Reva: No, I... I just need some sleep.",
        "Josh: Reva, come on.",
        "Reva: What do you want from me? You know, this family is barely inches away from falling apart, and it's nerves. It's just my nerves.",
        "Josh: Reva, you've seen something.",
        "Reva: Yes.",
        "Josh: What?",
        "Reva: I have. By the door. Didn't you hear anything?",
        "Josh: I don't have your gift.",
        "Reva: Lucky.",
        "Josh: I just know that the last time you had visions, it had something to do with the kids, so I'm worried.",
        "Reva: About marah?",
        "Josh: Yes. Go see her and let me know how she's doing.",
        "Reva: Okay.",
        "Josh: Okay?",
        "Reva: What are you trying to tell me?",
        "Alan: Don't you see, phillip, that you are something? You are a better man than I am. Look, I have fought you, I know that. But at the same time, I was very proud of you, son. I loved you more than anything! Phi maybe if I had listened to you just a little bit more, i wouldn't be where I am right now.",
        "Alan: Phillip, this isn't you, this cynicism, giving up on yourself, on other people. This isn't you, son!",
        "Phillip: Well, tell me, alan, what exactly is there to hold onto? You've never put your trust in anyone.",
        "Alan: No, but I wanted to. I just couldn'T. But you see, that came easy for you, because you were good.",
        "Phillip: No.",
        "Alan: Come over here. I think you need to get some sleep, phillip.",
        "Phillip: I do that a lot.",
        "Alan: Tomorrow you'll feel more like yourself.",
        "Phillip: So will you.",
        "Gus: How do I live with myself if I turn my father in?",
        "Harley: You don't have a choice.",
        "Gus: Really? Could you turn your father in?",
        "Harley: Just be careful. He's good-- manipulating, twisting everything to his advantage. Hey, even you. Especially you.",
        "Gus: He's my father.",
        "Harley: Honey, I know that that means something to you, but if you're asking me if it means something to him...",
        "Gus: I think it does.",
        "Harley: I think you want to believe that. Listen, you love him. I think that's great. And I think it's a hell of a lot more than a man like alan spaulding deserves from you.",
        "Gus: But is this even right? I'm balancing how I feel about my father on one hand, and justice on the other.",
        "Harley: You do what you have to do. I don't know. I don't know. But please, please, please don't let him take you down with him.",
        "Josh: Next on \"guiding light\"...",
        "Gus: And that's the thing. If I do the right thing, well, then my old man's going to spend the rest of his days in the slammer.",
