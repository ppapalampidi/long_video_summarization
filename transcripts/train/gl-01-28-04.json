Cassie agrees to keep the baby's existence a secret, at least for now. Meanwhile, Edmund keeps up his pursuit of the facts surrounding Cassie's lost child. But her very real teenage daughter puts other demands on him, as Edmund and Sandy get caught up in Tammy and Joey's struggles with Romeo and Juliet \u0096 both on and off the stage. While they try to counsel the teenagers, Sandy is caught short by something Joey says and realizes he's been unfair to Marah.

Carrie doesn't shy from their accusations and is able to bring Michelle and Marina back into the fold. When Marah returns to the Museum she gets a scare, but Sandy is there to make peace. Josh holds onto Reva and makes love to her for what he believes may be the last time. As he leaves for the police station, he encounters Billy who warns him that a threat may have been made on Michelle's life and Marah may be next.

    "Transcript": [
        "Olivia: Emma's a Spaulding. Her sister's still a threat. Her father is falling apart. And if the rest of the family knew about her, they would... they would stop at nothing to get their hands on her. I can't let that happen, Cassie. I'll leave town with her if I have to to avoid that. But it's not my call. You know about her now. What happens next is really up to you.",
        "Cassie: I just want what's best for the baby, Olivia...",
        "Olivia: Well, then you tell me what you would do. Honestly, mother to mother. How far would you go to protect your baby?",
        "Cassie: Can I see her?",
        "Olivia: She's in the nursery with Sam. I'll... I'll be right back, okay?",
        "Edmund: Cassie, you're thinking your son may still be alive.",
        "Olivia: You know she hasn't met that many new people, yet. And I'm not really sure how she's going to be. (Laughs) Emma, this is Cassie, Mommy's friend, I hope.",
        "Sandy: But every line has to sound like you're saying it for the first time. And the more we rehearse, the better you'll get at it.",
        "Joey: Whoa, more rehearsals?",
        "Sandy: Yeah.",
        "Tammy: So the more we repeat the words, the easier it will be to make it sound like we've never said them before.",
        "Sandy: Exactly.",
        "Joey: Yeah, wait, I don't get that.",
        "Sandy: Maybe Edmund can explain it better. Edmund?",
        "Edmund: Hmm?",
        "Tammy: Great. How are we going to hold an audience if our own Shakespeare Advisor is bored with us?",
        "Edmund: \"Bored?\" \"Bored?\" Don't be ridiculous. Look, find a table and I'll be with you in a moment, all right? Dax, what's the news? No, Cassie doesn't know I'm asking around. Yes, I know perfectly well what goes on behind closed palace doors. But if there's even the slightest chance that one of Richard's enemies took that baby and paid off a doctor... yes, I know perfectly well that I was Richard's greatest enemy. But I didn't do it, Dax. I didn't take the baby and I didn't make Cassie's doctor disappear. Look, look, I need you to follow through on this for me. Look into every threat against Richard at the time of the birth, please, and find that damn doctor.",
        "Tammy: Uncle Edmund, is everything okay?",
        "Edmund: \"When I talk of dreams, which are the children of an idle brain, begot of nothing but vain fantasy.\"",
        "Tammy: \"Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace. Thou talk'st of nothing.\"",
        "Edmund: Bravo. You see? And you thought I was bored. Shall we?",
        "Carrie: Well, it's a shawl.",
        "Michelle: Yeah, we can see that.",
        "Carrie: But it's a present for you, Michelle. Something to keep you warm on those long, cold nights when your husband is on the campaign trail. No more of those gas fires. What's the matter? You two look rather grumpy. Should I have brought you a little present, too?",
        "Marah: I don't think we want anymore of your presents, Carrie. They all come with strings attached.",
        "Carrie: Oh, the rings, the magical rings. I thought you'd forgotten all about them. The rings and their wishes. Well, surely you don't regret your wish, Michelle. Or you, Marina. And Marah. You haven't even wished yet. Surely you want to. Well, those wonderful wishes, they all came true. There's nothing for you to be frightened of.",
        "Reva: I saw your press conference. I thought it went really well. I think the rec center is going to be just what this town needs. I'll bet Shayne's proud of you. I know I am. And I'd wish you'd let me know you were coming over. I look a mess.",
        "Josh: You look beautiful.",
        "Reva: Yeah? Well, you need glasses. So, you want to sit down? I could fix you something to drink.",
        "Josh: No, thank you. I just... there's something I have to do tomorrow.",
        "Reva: What is it?",
        "Josh: It's... it's just this thing that I have to do in the morning.",
        "Reva: What thing?",
        "Josh: A meeting.",
        "Reva: Oh. Business meeting?",
        "Josh: No.",
        "Reva: Does it have something to do with Billy?",
        "Josh: What makes you ask that?",
        "Reva: Because I know you've been worried about Billy. And I know that he has a knack for finding trouble. So why don't you just tell me what it is?",
        "Josh: A lot... a lot of things are going to change.",
        "Reva: What things?",
        "Josh: Do you remember at Cross Creek we used to go... walking up a certain trail? There was a fork there and...",
        "Reva: It went around with the oak...",
        "Josh: ...At the fork there was a big oak tree...",
        "Reva: Yes, of course, I do.",
        "Josh: Do you remember what happened the first time we ever went walking there?",
        "Reva: (Laughs) Yes. You wanted to go right, I wanted to go left. And we went left and, of course, the next two weeks we spent cursing the perils of poison ivy. But we did have a lot of fun with the calamine lotion.",
        "Josh: But the next time we went walking there, we went to the right.",
        "Reva: Well, yeah.",
        "Josh: Because sometimes, sometimes you... you make the wrong choice. And sometimes... you get... you get a second chance to make the right choice.",
        "Reva: Okay, you're not talking about Cross Creek anymore, are you? This is something a little more... deep. Can I get you that drink? You know, because you're not doing a very good job of reassuring me that...",
        "Josh: I just want... I just want to make sure that no matter what happens tomorrow, I won't lose your respect.",
        "Reva: Joshua Lewis, you are the finest man I have ever known. And nothing in this world could stop me from loving you or respecting you.",
        "Josh: I wouldn't be so sure of that.",
        "Reva: Yeah, well, I am sure. If we could survive Shayne's accident, we can survive anything.",
        "Josh: There's so much I want to tell you.",
        "Reva: So tell me.",
        "Josh: I can't. I don't... There's not enough time.",
        "Reva: What are you talking about? We have all the time in the world.",
        "Josh: No, we have tonight. And I want to stay here with you tonight, if that's okay with you.",
        "Carrie: Oh, you know you have nothing to fear from me.",
        "Marina: Well, someone messed with the gas valve in Michelle's fireplace.",
        "Marah: And when she looked up, she saw you.",
        "Michelle: And you're the one who's telling us to put the pieces together, Carrie.",
        "Carrie: Oh, touch\u00e9, Michelle. Touch\u00e9, touch\u00e9. But didn't you tell them the rest of the story, Michelle?",
        "Michelle: You mean your story, that you came to rescue me? Isn't it awfully convenient, Carrie, that just after I threatened to tell our fathers about you, there's an accidental gas leak in my home that knocks me out?",
        "Carrie: Well, I'll admit, My Dear, when you put it that way, it does sound a little sinister. I can't believe after all this time and everything I've told you, you must know that all I want, all I've ever really wanted, is for your father and your father and your grandfather to admit their guilt in Maryanne's death and to repent. I can't believe that you would think that I would ever, ever harm the three of you.",
        "Marah: Why should we believe you?",
        "Carrie: Because, frankly, My Dear, you're no good to me dead. It's only the three of you that keep Maryanne's story alive.",
        "Michelle: No, we're just helping you keep your secret, while we torment our fathers, and it ends today.",
        "Tammy: Uncle Edmund, you're zoning out again.",
        "Edmund: Sorry.",
        "Tammy: It was the balcony scene, wasn't it? It was totally flat.",
        "Joey: Well, don't blame me. Maybe if Shakespeare wrote in English...",
        "Sandy: Actually...",
        "Tammy: I know you're trying really hard, but the way you talk to Juliet, you might as well be asking her if she wants fries with that.",
        "Sandy: I don't want him spouting poetry. It should just be two teenagers talking.",
        "Joey: You see? I knew you were a brilliant director, man.",
        "Tammy: What do you think, Uncle Edmund?",
        "Edmund: Hmm, about?",
        "Tammy: The play. Romeo and Juliet is supposed to be poetic. It's supposed to break your heart.",
        "Edmund: Oh, well, I wouldn't want to interfere with Sandy's direction.",
        "Sandy: No, no, it's cool. Suggest away.",
        "Edmund: Uh, well, uh... Joey, perhaps during love scenes, Romeo could be a bit more... demonstrative.",
        "Tammy: Okay, so maybe when Juliet says, \"Wilt thou be gone...\"",
        "(Kiss)",
        "Tammy: Joey!",
        "Joey: What? You want demonstrative, there's your demonstrative.",
        "Tammy: Forget demonstrative, where's the poetry?",
        "Joey: Forget the poetry, where's the sex?",
        "Cassie: Hello. Hello, Emma. Hi there. Look at these little fingers. Oh, Olivia, she's beautiful. She is. Are you going to give me a smile, huh? Yeah. (Laughs)",
        "Olivia: You're really good with her, you know. I'm... I'm constantly worried that I'm holding her wrong or feeding her wrong or doing something, anything wrong.",
        "Cassie: Oh, it will come to you. I've had four -- three chances to get it right, you know.",
        "Olivia: I hated pretending that I lost her.",
        "Cassie: You still are.",
        "Olivia: But with you, I... I just can't imagine...",
        "Cassie: Well, you know what, you're in. Congratulations, you're in.",
        "Olivia: I'm in what?",
        "Cassie: The sisterhood. You know, mothers just don't take care of their kids. They do take care of each other, so, welcome to the club.",
        "Olivia: Well, I never was much of a joiner, but this is one club I can get used to.",
        "Cassie: I would have done the same thing.",
        "Olivia: You mean?",
        "Cassie: Until you know that she's safe, you have to do whatever it takes to protect her. You know, I'm already late. I really... I have to meet Tammy and Edmund at Towers, so... I won't tell.",
        "Olivia: Thank you. If anyone had to find us, I'm glad it was you.",
        "Cassie: But, Olivia... I mean, Phillip, he's your husband now. He's the baby's father. He should know.",
        "Olivia: He's going to know. I just... it can't be now, because I'm just afraid the shock would be too much for him.",
        "Cassie: I think it could be so good for him. What could be more wonderful than finding out a child that you've lost forever is still alive? Treasure every moment. It goes by really fast.",
        "Tammy: It's not all about sex.",
        "Joey: Tell that to Romeo. He got with Juliet pretty quick.",
        "Tammy: It was their wedding night.",
        "Joey: It was a bogus wedding. There was no license, no witnesses.",
        "Edmund: Joey, the important thing to remember is that while Romeo and Juliet rushed into marriage in defiance of their parent's will...",
        "Joey: Right. So what you're saying is that we shouldn't listen to the stupid rules that grownups make up.",
        "Edmund: Well, that's not exactly what...",
        "Tammy: Okay. So Romeo and Juliet broke the rules. Well, look where it got them.",
        "Joey: You're the one who thinks it's so magical.",
        "Tammy: Not magical -- poetic.",
        "Sandy: Okay. Why don't we give Shakespeare a rest?",
        "Edmund: Great idea. Let's try the cheesecake.",
        "Joey: You know what, Tammy? It's easy to take a chance on something good in a play. But to actually do it in real life, that takes some guts. Sorry if that's not poetic enough for you.",
        "Carrie: Well, let's assume for a moment that I did come here for revenge, that I did try to kill Michelle. Well, I think you should tell your fathers.",
        "Marina: Seriously?",
        "Carrie: Well, yes. I think you should go to them and tell them that this madwoman called Carrie is intent not only on destroying their lives, but their daughters' as well, if that's what you believe, if that's what you really believe.",
        "Michelle: I don't know, Carrie. I really don't know what to believe.",
        "Carrie: Well, it's very simple, Michelle. I came here to talk to you and I smelled the gas and I walked in and I saw you unconscious on the floor and I turned the gas off.",
        "Marina: Maybe she was really trying to save you.",
        "Marah: Or maybe she came here to finish you off.",
        "Josh: I'm sorry. That was crazy.",
        "Reva: No.",
        "Josh: I don't know what I'm thinking, here, at this time at night. And I'm sure that you have plans.",
        "Reva: No.",
        "Josh: I just...",
        "Reva: No. I don't. I have no other plans. I don't. And I have been wanting this.",
        "Josh: Okay.",
        "Reva: I want you to stay. I've been wanting this for a very long time.",
        "Josh: Wait, wait. Whoa, whoa. Wait. Where are you going?",
        "Reva: Well, you know, I'm all for spontaneity, but there's something to be said for setting the mood.",
        "Josh: I don't need mood. I just need you.",
        "Reva: Hey, it's been a very long way home for both of us. I just want tonight to be special.",
        "Josh: Every night I've ever spent with you has been special. And my heart still skips a beat whenever you walk into a room.",
        "Reva: Yeah?",
        "Josh: Yes.",
        "Reva: Well, I still get butterflies whenever I hear your voice. Oh.",
        "Josh: What? What was that?",
        "Reva: Well, I actually saved the message that you left on the machine, the... you know, when you left, and I was so lonely that I kept playing the stupid thing over and over again. \"You have now reached the Lewises.\" Only I was the only Lewis here. And I missed my husband so much.",
        "Josh: I hated leaving you. You've made me very happy over the years -- happier than I deserve.",
        "Reva: Happiness isn't something you deserve. Happiness is something you share with someone you love. And this isn't just something from the past, either. We have the rest of our lives.",
        "Josh: Just tonight.",
        "Reva: Why do you keep... I don't understand. Are you going somewhere?",
        "Edmund: Tammy, you've cried all over a perfectly good piece of cheesecake. Let's get you another one.",
        "Tammy: No, I don't want any more.",
        "Sandy: I think I'm going to go have a talk with Joey.",
        "Tammy: Yeah. You can tell him he was right. I am a coward. I've been hiding behind someone else's words so I wouldn't have to...",
        "Edmund: Tammy, no niece of mine is a coward.",
        "Tammy: This one is.",
        "Edmund: Why? Because you see deeper meanings in things? Because you think there's more to life than hanging out at the mall and surfing the net?",
        "Tammy: Those things are good enough for Joey.",
        "Edmund: Well, then maybe Joey isn't good enough for you.",
        "Joey: Hey, man, but it's like I'm not good enough for her.",
        "Sandy: Well, don't jump. That was supposed to be a joke.",
        "Joey: Stick to directing.",
        "Sandy: All right.",
        "Joey: Look, Sandy, I don't want to talk about it. It's just that I'm crazy about her. Forget it. And I'm doing this play. I'm trying to make her happy. But whatever I do, it just doesn't work. Whatever. I don't even want to think about it. I just don't get it. Its like... it's like she wants me to be someone I'm not.",
        "Tammy: I just want him to be a little different. I mean, I like Joey for who he is, but...",
        "Edmund: But he doesn't make a very good Romeo. No. I'm betting, though, he makes a pretty fantastic Joey. Think maybe you could tell him that?",
        "Joey: I don't know how to tell her. She keeps pushing me to change.",
        "Sandy: Well, aren't you pushing her to put out?",
        "Joey: No, I...",
        "Sandy: Maybe you both should just stop pushing and accept each other for who you are.",
        "Joey: That work for you?",
        "(Door closes)",
        "Joey: Hey.",
        "Tammy: Hey.",
        "Sandy: Well, I'm going to... I'll just leave you... yeah.",
        "Michelle: I don't know, Carrie. I really don't know what to believe.",
        "Marah: Don't tell me you actually believe her.",
        "Marina: Everything she said up until this point has been true.",
        "Carrie: Believe me, I know how much I've asked of all of you, but we are so close now. I know that your fathers are finally going to tell you the truth. Now, are you with me?",
        "Marah: No. I'm with my father.",
        "_Marah: And you thought Tony was so bad for me. Did Tony ever leave some woman to die? Did he try to cover it up and go on with his life like it was just some parking ticket that he got out of? _",
        "Josh: Marah, if you would just let me explain...",
        "Marah: No. At least with Tony you knew what you were getting, Dad. Your whole life has been a fraud. Josh Lewis, upstanding citizen, pillar of the community. What a joke.",
        "Shayne: All I wanted to do was make you proud. \"Throw harder, Son!\" \"Run faster, Son!\"",
        "Josh: Shayne...",
        "Shayne: You got any advice for me now, Dad, huh? Why don't we go have a catch? You can teach me how to live a lie.",
        "Josh: I was young, like you. I was scared. I didn't know what to do.",
        "Reva: Don't you dare say you did this for us, Joshua.",
        "Josh: But I did. I thought I was going to lose you.",
        "Reva: And now you have. You've lost everything.",
        "_Josh: No. Don't go. Don't leave. _",
        "Reva: Like you left her?",
        "Josh: No.",
        "Reva: I can see her, Joshua. Maryanne, with the long black hair. I can feel her panic, the water rushing all around. She needs air. She can't get it. She's fighting for it. No, wait. She's not fighting anymore, because she knows she's going to die! Cold water burning her lungs, the darkness washing over her.",
        "Josh: Please, Reva, you have to forgive me.",
        "Reva: And now it's you, Joshua. Now it's you drowning, all alone, just like she did. Just like the girl you forgot.",
        "Reva: What is it? Hey, hey, it's okay. You were just dreaming.",
        "Edmund: Well, aren't you a sight for sore eyes?",
        "Cassie: Hey, you. Sorry I'm late. Where's Tammy?",
        "Edmund: She's on the balcony.",
        "Cassie: Oh, it's freezing out there.",
        "Edmund: Yes, but I think the fresh air is going to do them some good.",
        "Cassie: \"Them?\"",
        "Edmund: Romeo and Juliet. They've been fighting.",
        "Cassie: Oh. I don't remember that being a fight in the play.",
        "Edmund: Well, I think Sandy and I handled the situation.",
        "Cassie: I'd better go out there.",
        "Edmund: No, no, no, no, no. Why don't you sit down? I think Tammy and Joey will work this out all right.",
        "Tammy: (Laughs)",
        "Joey: You can't be laughing right now.",
        "Tammy: It's just ironic.",
        "Joey: What?",
        "Tammy: No, I shouldn't say. It has to do with the play.",
        "Joey: No, tell me.",
        "Tammy: Well, it's just that the balcony scene is, like, the most romantic scene, and here we are on a balcony, fighting.",
        "Joey: Are we still fighting?",
        "Tammy: Aren't we?",
        "Joey: I don't know. We're out here, we're talking. Look, I screwed up.",
        "Tammy: No, I screwed up. I've been making you feel like you're not enough for me.",
        "Joey: Yeah, but I've been pushing you to... you know, and I know you're not ready yet.",
        "Tammy: Well, I never said...",
        "Joey: So you are?",
        "Tammy: I don't know. Okay, how about this? How about we just rewind to where we were before we both screwed up?",
        "Joey: What, and just let things happen?",
        "Tammy: Yeah. I'd like that.",
        "Joey: Me, too. Though I don't mind this making-up stuff. It kind of... what did your uncle call it?",
        "Tammy: \"Demonstrative?\"",
        "Joey: Yeah.",
        "Edmund: So where have you been? I left messages on your machine.",
        "Cassie: I didn't have time to check. You know, I had a hotel emergency.",
        "Edmund: Oh. Could Olivia not have handled it?",
        "Cassie: No. No. She couldn't have.",
        "Edmund: Did you cover for her? You've been covering a lot for her lately.",
        "Cassie: Yeah.",
        "Edmund: I hope she appreciates the friend she has in you.",
        "Cassie: Yeah. Yeah, she does. You know, we're close. We've gotten a lot closer. The hotel and stuff we have in common, so...",
        "Edmund: Miracles do happen, Cassie.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, they do. And you know, right here, this is all the miracle I need.",
        "(Kissing)",
        "Joey: Sorry. Sorry, I...",
        "Cassie: (Clears throat)",
        "Josh: I should go.",
        "Reva: No. No, no, no, no, no. Stay. You said you wanted to.",
        "Josh: I do want to.",
        "Reva: Is it the dream? You want to talk about it?",
        "Josh: No, I don't.",
        "Reva: Well, the night's still young. Don't go.",
        "Josh: I'd stay if I could.",
        "Reva: You can.",
        "Josh: It's just this meeting tomorrow.",
        "Reva: Forget the meeting.",
        "Josh: I can't forget it, Reva. I can't forget it. You're my life, you know that?",
        "Reva: And you're mine. Tonight can be forever. Whatever you have to do can wait.",
        "Josh: No, it can't. Not anymore.",
        "Reva: There's nothing I can do to change your mind?",
        "Josh: No.",
        "Reva: All this talk about time. Promise me that I'll see you again.",
        "Josh: You'll see me again. You'll just never look at me the same way.",
        "Marah: \"Went to the movies. If you're feeling ambitious, the trash needs to go out. Shayne and Remy.\" Well, at least you guys still have a sense of humor. (Gasps) What are you doing here?",
        "Sandy: Taking out the trash. I came to see you, found the note, thought I'd be a good brother.",
        "Marah: Was this open when you got here, this tunnel?",
        "Sandy: Yeah. I thought that was weird. Don't you guys usually keep it shut?",
        "Marah: Yeah.",
        "Sandy: Marah, you okay?",
        "Marah: Polly Dolly?",
        "Sandy: Who?",
        "Marah: My rag doll. I got her for my third birthday. I thought she... I lost her when our house caught on fire. Where did you find her?",
        "Sandy: I didn't.",
        "Olivia: \"Over time, new mothers will learn to trust their instincts. You have to teach your baby, and if you listen and watch, you'll find that your baby has even more to teach you.\"",
        "(Baby cries)",
        "Olivia: Hey. Hey, what's wrong? Let's see, you're dry and you're fed. Oh, are you just worried that Mommy's not going to be here? I'm always going to be here for you, sweet girl. And don't you worry. Mommy's going to make sure you get all the wonderful things you deserve.",
        "(Music box playing)",
        "Tammy: Mom, Joey and I were just rehearsing.",
        "Joey: You said I should be more demonstrative.",
        "Edmund: I said Romeo should , and maybe not so much.",
        "Joey: Right. Got you.",
        "Cassie: What's the word for \"rehearsal's over,\" Edmund?",
        "Edmund: Well, I don't know, but in film it's called \"it's a wrap.\"",
        "Cassie: I think it's a wrap.",
        "Tammy: Two minutes?",
        "Cassie: Make it one.",
        "Tammy: Well, good night.",
        "Joey: Your mom...",
        "Tammy: I know. She can be a little intense sometimes.",
        "Joey: No, she's cool. In fact, she's pretty hot.",
        "Tammy: Really?",
        "Joey: Definitely. Come on. I'd better get you back inside before she starts screaming.",
        "(Phone rings)",
        "Cassie: You know what? Why don't you take that, and I'll see you back at the Beacon?",
        "Edmund: Right.",

        "Edmund: Good.",
        "Cassie: All right, Romeo and Juliet. Let's go.",
        "Edmund: Hello? Dax? Tell me you found Cassie's doctor. Brilliant. Where is he? All right. Then how exactly did he die?",
        "Marah: Sandy, on a normal day, I might be amused. But today is not a normal day, and I am not amused. So where did you find Polly? Was she at my mom's house in the attic somewhere, or what?",
        "Sandy: Marah, I've never seen her before, I swear.",
        "Marah: Well, then, what are you doing here?",
        "Sandy: Long story short?",
        "Marah: Yes, please.",
        "Sandy: Okay. Okay. I've been thinking, and I realized I haven't been fair to you.",
        "Marah: Are you apologizing?",
        "Sandy: Well, I'm trying to.",
        "Marah: Well, by all means, keep going, then.",
        "Sandy: Okay. I just don't think I... I've been hard on you. I put you on this pedestal as this idealized sister and, you know, one who wouldn't go out with guys like Jeffrey O'Neill.",
        "Marah: Okay, now you can stop.",
        "Sandy: Well, I want you to know that from now on I'm going to lighten up, okay?",
        "Marah: Yeah. We're still new at this whole brother-sister thing, and I do want you to care. I just... I don't want you to interfere.",
        "Sandy: Maybe we can help each other walk the fine line.",
        "Marah: I'm walking fine lines all over the place lately. I've sort of become an expert.",
        "Sandy: So are we cool, Sis?",
        "Marah: Yeah. Yeah, we're cool.",
        "Sandy: All right. All right. You want me to stick around until the guys get back?",
        "Marah: No. I'll be fine, thanks. It's okay.",
        "Sandy: Then I'll be saying goodnight to you and, um... Polly Dolly.",
        "Marah: Only a guy with a puppet for a friend would think to say good-bye to my doll.",
        "Billy: Hey, Josh.",
        "Josh: What the hell are you doing here? Look, I have a meeting with Frank in the morning. There's nothing you can say that's going to...",
        "Billy: Josh, somebody tried to kill Michelle Bauer tonight.",
        "Josh: What?",
        "Billy: Yeah. It was a gas leak. Something having to do with the...",
        "Josh: A gas leak? A gas leak doesn't mean anything. It...",
        "Billy: Come on. Ed said that somebody tampered with it when she was there by herself, and if Danny hadn't showed up, it could have been all over for her.",
        "Josh: Maybe it was an accident.",
        "Billy: Josh, you're not listening to me. Somebody's trying to get even for Maryanne Caruthers, and the girls are now fair game.",
        "Josh: Well, if that's the case, we should go to Frank right now. We should find him, we should talk to him tonight.",
        "Billy: Wait a minute. You can't go to...",
        "Josh: But if somebody's going after my daughter, I'm going to stop that from happening, Billy. If that means turning ourselves in, I'm going to be the first one to put the cuffs on.",
        "Billy: Okay. Well, just supposing that that is enough, supposing that you're in jail and this psycho decides to still go after her. What about that? I mean, supposing it's somebody that they trust, and they don't even see it coming. You won't be able to do anything, because you'll be in Cell Block B. Listen. If you want to go to jail for the rest of your life, let's do it for the right reasons. Do it because you helped me rid the world of this creep who is trying to kill your daughter.",
        "Josh: When is this thing going to end, Billy? When is it ever going to end?",
        "Billy: It won't end until we end it.",
        "Jeffrey: Next on Guiding Light...",
        "Danny: How'd that piece about my cousin, Tony, being in a fight wind up on the front page of The Mirror , Ross?",
        "Ross: How should I know?",
        "Eden: We make a pretty good team.",
        "Tony: That's exactly my point.",
