    "Recap": [
        "Brooke reminds Bill that she is marrying Ridge. Is Bill ever unsure of himself? Bill says Ridge will break her heart and that is something he will not do. He laughs and says that gives them all the time in the world when she says the timeline now is to wait and get Quinn out of their lives. Ridge tells Quinn as long as she is in his office she can make herself useful. He needs a model for a certain red dress. She says yes King Ridge. Wyatt tells Steffy that he lets her be herself, not like his old stick-in-the-mud brother. He says the world cannot get enough of her. She is an influencer now and now is not the time to diminish that. Liam comes back and he accuses Wyatt of having little respect for Steffy as this is not the real her. This new social media is an insult. Pam comes in and says Wyatt is doing a bang up job. She tells Liam that she really liked the video. Liam grouses again that they do not need a sexy CEO and it is an insult, no one can take her seriously like this. Wyatt tells him to dial that back as the old prude that he is. Bill tells Brooke that it is not fair as Ridge will let her down again, whereas he will be here and they can get on with their life together. She will be his. It is only a matter of time. She is only sacrificing her own happiness for RJ. He's not going anywhere. Katie is getting on with her life and they will co-parent so Will is okay.",
        "Katie drops in on Eric (wonder if she checked with Quinn first). She asks about Quinn and says she might not like finding her here. Eric says she is at the office. Quinn tries on the red dress with a long slit. Ridge drops to his knees and starts fiddling with the hem. Quinn looks uncomfortable but she tells Ridge he is really good at this. She gets around to the subject of Brooke and when they are going to get married. He tells her that is none of her business. He is concentrating on the company right now. In twirling around with the new length Quinn falls down with a sprained ankle. Ridge rushes to her and puts his hands on her around the waist and then the leg and then goes to get ice. He puts her foot in his hands and she quips she never thought she would see the day of him taking care of her. She says since he has to keep the ice on her foot they could just chat to get to know each other a little better. She wonders if he is just a little bit upset that his father gave Steffy the CEO job. He says he is doing what is best for the company. He says make no mistake he still despises Quinn despite helping her. She says it is mutual; she still despises him too. But now she will hobble out to the parking lot and go home to her husband. Wyatt tells Steffy and Liam that this is huge, she has another 100,000 followers since last night. Steffy finds it fascinating. Quinn tells Eric all she had to do was almost break her ankle to get Ridge to warm up to her. He is being supportive of Steffy though and he used one of Quinn's designs in the jewelry line. Eric tells her there is only three things he demands of her \u0096 her love, her loyalty and her love yes he said it twice as he wants a double dipping. Liam tells Ridge that it drives him nuts to see Steffy fall more and more into Wyatt's clutches. They have to get rid of Quinn. He wants to know more about this flirting she did to come on to Ridge. Ridge replies whatever it takes to bring down Quinn Fuller he has to take it."

        "Brooke: Are you ever unsure of yourself?",
        "Bill: No. Certainly not when it comes to us.",
        "Brooke: I'm marrying Ridge.",
        "Bill: Yeah, well, you know, best-laid plans... see, I'm not a believer in you, Ridge, and all that destiny garbage. His track record speaks for itself. He simply doesn't value you the way I do. He gets distracted by other women. Breaks your heart. I'll never do that.",
        "Brooke: I don't want you to be unrealistic...",
        "Bill: Well, that's perfect because I don't want you to be unrealistic. Did you set a date yet?",
        "Brooke: We have a time frame.",
        "Bill: Ah.",
        "Brooke: He doesn't want to get married till Quinn is out of our lives. He doesn't want that hanging over our heads.",
        "Bill: Seriously?",
        "Brooke: Yeah.",
        "Bill: [Laughs] Well, that is absolutely perfect. That gives us all the time in the world to get back on track.",
        "Ridge: Well, since you're still here, you might as well make yourself useful.",
        "Quinn: And how may I serve you, king Ridge?",
        "Ridge: Hold this up where I can see it. Hey, Pam, get me a fit model, please.",
        "Quinn: Oh, I know. You want to see it move. It's the same way when I design a piece of jewelry. I don't know what it's gonna look like until I put it on somebody.",
        "Ridge: All right, calm down. Yeah, mm-hmm.",
        "Pam: You hung up before I could say anything. All the fit models are down in the boutique today. Private showing. You okayed it.",
        "Ridge: I know. Okay. Sorry. Thank you.",
        "Pam: Sorry.",
        "Ridge: It's okay. All right. You'll have to do.",
        "Quinn: You want me to model it?",
        "Ridge: Sure. You modeled the showstopper, so I think you can do this.",
        "Quinn: And very well, I might add. Okay. I'll put it on.",
        "Wyatt: It's just us. You can admit it. You miss me, don't you?",
        "Steffy: [Chuckles] What makes you think that?",
        "Wyatt: That, right there. My ability to put a smile on your face. I mean, it probably doesn't happen that much anymore, right?",
        "Steffy: Wyatt, stop, please.",
        "Wyatt: What? I'm just saying. Spending all that time with my stick-in-the-mud brother? \"Steffy, you can't do that. Steffy, that's inappropriate.\" Me, on the other hand, I'm happy to let you be you because you -- you do you, boo. That's what you do. And it's incredible. And now the world knows about it.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, that's because of your non-stop posting.",
        "Wyatt: Well... stick with me, kid, and I'll make you an even bigger star. Just like I made you my wife.",
        "Steffy: I don't know, Wyatt. Maybe we should just step back from the online bombardment for a while.",
        "Wyatt: You don't just stop a successful roll.",
        "Steffy: What about over-saturation? Familiarity, it breeds contempt.",
        "Wyatt: Contempt?",
        "Steffy: Yeah.",
        "Wyatt: For this gorgeous face? Are you insane? You have to own that, Steffy. The world can't get enough of you, and I happen to know firsthand. Yeah.",
        "Steffy: [Laughs]",
        "Wyatt: In record time, you have gone from social media celebrity to genuine influencer. It's crazy. Like, it's only gonna be good for the brands, Forrester's and yours. Now is not the time to stop the momentum.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, the spoiler's here, just in time.",
        "Liam: Let me guess what I'm interrupting -- something to do with your ridiculous never-ending media campaign?",
        "Wyatt: Oh, it's worked gangbusters so far. Steffy's a sensation, a role model, and an influencer, so thank you.",
        "Liam: This avatar that you've created is not Steffy. She shouldn't be fodder for the masses, and you constantly pushing her to be that shows how little you really respect her.",
        "Bill: So let's play a little game here. How many times has Ridge failed already at getting rid of Quinn? As many times as he's failed at being married to you.",
        "Brooke: Bill! That's not fair.",
        "Bill: What's not fair is you putting yourself through that again. He will let you down. The good news is, you know I will be here for you when he does.",
        "Brooke: Dollar Bill Spencer, waiting a woman?",
        "Bill: You're not gonna marry Ridge. And the sooner you can be honest about that, the sooner we can get on with our life together. You will be mine. It's just a matter of time.",
        "Katie: I'm so glad you called. I've been meaning to stop by and thank you for Christmas. It was lovely.",
        "Eric: It was wonderful that you were here. Call me old-fashioned, but I believe that the holidays are a time for gathering. I loved having the family here. I really did. In spite of their own plans and their reservations about Quinn.",
        "Katie: Yeah, uh, speaking of Quinn, is she here?",
        "Eric: She's at the office. You need to see her?",
        "Katie: No, no, I just, um... I guess I'm a little trepidatious.",
        "Eric: About Quinn?",
        "Katie: Well, I just don't think that she would like finding us alone together.",
        "Quinn: Ta-da! What do you think?",
        "Ridge: Turn around one more time, slowly.",
        "Quinn: That's all you've got?",
        "Ridge: Get up here.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] Well, a gentleman would assist.",
        "Ridge: It's a step.",
        "Quinn: Fine.",
        "Liam: Steffy is the C.E.O. of Forrester Creations. That is a huge deal for someone her age.",
        "Wyatt: Are you trying to make my point? I don't --",
        "Liam: No. No, no. I'm saying there's a certain dignity that comes with the job, and how is Steffy supposed to convey that when her every move is plastered all over social media all the time? It's an insult.",
        "Wyatt: It is a new day and age, Liam. A new social media influence. You have to use it to service the brand. You define your own narrative. You show the people what you want and you keep back what's close. You know what? How about I deal with her social media presence 'cause that's kind of my job. Okay?",
        "Pam: Doing a bang-up job. I saw that new, uh, video on the website. \"Sexy C.E.O.\"",
        "Steffy: \"Sexy C.E.O.?\" I don't know about this. Wyatt, what did you do?",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles]",
        "Bill: I have waited a long time for you.",
        "Brooke: We're not gonna happen, Bill. I'm marrying Ridge.",
        "Bill: Why? Because you love him?",
        "Brooke: Yes, I do.",
        "Bill: Not the way you love me.",
        "Brooke: Bill.",
        "Bill: You're trying to do right by your family. You're sacrificing your own happiness to give R.J. What he didn't have growing up -- his parents in the same house. You're worried about will. You don't have to be worried about will. He has two parents that love him and are devoted to co-parenting. Katie and I are not getting back together, all right? She is -- she is happy with her independence and living in her new home, and I am hopelessly in love with you.",
        "Brooke: Mm.",
        "Bill: I'm not going anywhere. We're getting back together.",
        "Eric: You're worried about Quinn?",
        "Katie: No, not really. I'm just trying to respect her sometimes volatile feelings.",
        "Eric: Well, my wife isn't jealous or insecure. She has no reason to be.",
        "Katie: Of course not. If I seem overly cautious, it's just because I want you to have the best life possible.",
        "Eric: Well, I do. No problem there. Quinn sees to that.",
        "Katie: I just hope she doesn't let you down.",
        "Quinn: That thing you did, where you pinned the fabric up an inch -- it really made it more comfortable.",
        "Ridge: Well, that's the idea. Style and wearability.",
        "Quinn: You really are very good at this.",
        "Ridge: Validation at last.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] You could just say \"thank you.\"",
        "Ridge: You know what you could do? Turn sideways.",
        "Quinn: Mm. [Clears throat]",
        "Ridge: You're a very confident woman.",
        "Quinn: Why do you say that?",
        "Ridge: Oh, I heard a conversation you had with your husband's son, you stark naked.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] Our little shower moment.",
        "Ridge: Yeah. That. You weren't embarrassed at all, huh?",
        "Quinn: Should I have had reason to be?",
        "Ridge: Don't fish for compliments. It doesn't suit you. I already told you you looked nice.",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles] Well, I'm nothing compared to your blonde bombshell. When are you two getting married, anyway?",
        "Ridge: That's none of your business. Haven't set a date.",
        "Quinn: What are you waiting for?",
        "Ridge: Um, like I said, it doesn't really concern you, but right now, what I need to do is focus on the company and this family. What's going on here?",
        "Quinn: You are toeing the line. I mean, I thought you'd be more upset, you know, with Steffy being named C.E.O.",
        "Ridge: Oh, and there she is. Back to annoying me.",
        "Quinn: I didn't think I had any effect on you. Other than you hating me.",
        "Ridge: Can't blame me for that. All right. Turn all the way around. Let's see it.",
        "Quinn: Whee! Ooh! Oh! [Groans]",
        "Ridge: Are you okay?",
        "Quinn: Oh! [Inhales sharply]",
        "Ridge: What'd you do?",
        "Quinn: Oh, I hope I didn't sprain my ankle.",
        "Ridge: Oh, it's gonna be fine. It might swell up a little bit. Let me see it.",
        "Quinn: Yeah.",
        "Ridge: Don't be a baby.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] Ow!",
        "Ridge: I'll go get some ice.",
        "Quinn: Really? That's nice of you.",
        "Ridge: All right. Just don't move till I get back.",
        "Quinn: Where am I going? Ow.",
        "Steffy: Sexy C.E.O.? Seriously?",
        "Liam: Are you kidding me? How is anybody supposed to take Steffy seriously right now?",
        "Wyatt: Would you relax? Stop being such a prude! Steffy is sexy! Or don't you agree?",
        "Liam: That is not the point. You are cheapening her image.",
        "Wyatt: Oh.",
        "Pam: You know, for what it's worth... I am not usually a fan of overt content, but I really liked the video.",
        "Wyatt: Ha! There you go. Public has spoken. Thank you, pam.",
        "Pam: Okay.",
        "Wyatt: Thank you.",
        "Liam: You're awfully quiet. Are you -- are you okay with this?",
        "Steffy: [Sighs]",
        "Katie: So, do you miss not being C.E.O.? I mean, the excitement and the activity?",
        "Eric: No.",
        "Katie: No?",
        "Eric: I'm happy!",
        "Katie: [Laughs]",
        "Eric: The company's in great hands with Steffy and with Quinn. My granddaughter may not like my wife, but she knows that Quinn is smart and she's adaptable. She's creative.",
        "Katie: Well, your faith in Quinn is admirable.",
        "Eric: My family deserted me on my wedding day, but Quinn stood by my side, as she always does. I have her loyalty. Always. And that's what I want in a wife.",
        "Ridge: All right, let me see.",
        "Quinn: Aah.",
        "Ridge: Okay.",
        "Quinn: All right.",
        "Ridge: Let's just put this on here, keep the swelling down.",
        "Quinn: [Scoffs] Well, who would have thought this day would come? You taking care of me.",
        "Ridge: Taking care of you? No, I just don't want you to sue the company.",
        "Quinn: Ha. Well, maybe under all that gruffy grumpiness, that's who you really are -- a caretaker.",
        "Ridge: Or maybe it's just the magic of Christmas. Doesn't really matter, does it?",
        "Quinn: Yeah, I guess not. Well, since we're gonna be here for a little bit, we could, uh, chat. Get to know each other a little better.",
        "Ridge: What do you want from me, Quinn?",
        "Quinn: A chance. Can I ask you something?",
        "Ridge: Sure.",
        "Quinn: Aren't you a little bit upset that your father gave Steffy the C.E.O. Position over you? I mean, he could have vetoed my suggestion, but he endorsed it.",
        "Ridge: Hey. I've said it before, I'll say it again. I'm doing what's best for the company. This seems okay. Why don't you give it a shot?",
        "Quinn: Okay. Help me up?",
        "Ridge: Ah, you got this. Independent, strong woman.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] Aah! Yeah. Sure. I can hobble my way to the car, make it home to my husband.",
        "Ridge: Do you want me to call you a driver?",
        "Quinn: Nope. I'm fine. Thank you. I mean it. [Clears throat]",
        "Ridge: Hey.",
        "Quinn: Oh! Huh?",
        "Ridge: Make no mistake. I still despise you.",
        "Quinn: Good. Makes us even. I still despise you, too. I got it.",
        "Wyatt: It's only 30 seconds, and I just -- I kind grabbed some footage from the lingerie line and added a beat.",
        "Liam: The lingerie line?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Liam: What is wrong with you, Wyatt? Steffy's running one of the biggest fashion houses in the world, and you slap up a photo of her in a teddy?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, and it worked, too! She's up 100,000 followers since last night. I mean, you're probably the only one who hasn't seen it yet.",
        "Steffy: This is big, isn't it?",
        "Wyatt: This is huge! You sexy C.E.O., you.",
        "Liam: You are better than this. Don't sell yourself short.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] That feels good.",
        "Eric: So, Ridge helped you?",
        "Quinn: Uh, yeah, yeah. We -- we actually had a civilized conversation. It was pleasant.",
        "Eric: [Laughing] Well, I'm glad to hear that.",
        "Quinn: I know. [Sighs] It was encouraging, actually. I just think if I keep trying, maybe he'll warm up to me.",
        "Eric: It sounds like you tapped into ridge's softer side. That's not an easy task.",
        "Quinn: All I had to do was almost break my ankle.",
        "Eric: The things you do for me.",
        "Quinn: Oh, and don't you forget it.",
        "Eric: [Chuckles] So, how is it with Steffy?",
        "Quinn: She's doing a fabulous job. And we had a really good meeting today. Ridge didn't show up. [Chuckles] Of course. I think he's -- I think he's still really upset about being passed over for C.E.O.",
        "Eric: I'm sure you're right about that.",
        "Quinn: He will not admit this, but I think he's glad for Steffy. Supportive. Which is the way it should be. [Gasps] Oh! And one other thing! He incorporated one of my designs into his latest designs. One of my pieces!",
        "Eric: You're kidding. That's great news.",
        "Quinn: Yeah.",
        "Eric: Now that's hopeful.",
        "Quinn: Yeah.",
        "Eric: You know, he believes that I am completely under your control. And the fact is, he's right.",
        "Quinn: [Laughs]",
        "Eric: When I kiss you, it just --",
        "Quinn: I know. [Sighs] I know, I know. I feel the exact same way. Makes me so happy. It scares me.",
        "Eric: You don't trust it?",
        "Quinn: I don't trust me. The few times I've been happy in my life, I've... I've always managed to screw it up.",
        "Eric: Not gonna happen here. There's only three things I demand of you. I demand your love, your loyalty, and your love.",
        "Quinn: You said \"love\" twice.",
        "Eric: That's because I want a big double helping.",
        "Quinn: [Laughs]",
        "Liam: It drives me nuts watching Steffy fall more and more under Quinn's influence. And now -- now that the three of them are all cozy at the office together, Quinn and Wyatt have all day, every day to work their magic on her. I don't know. I don't know what to do. We got to get rid of Quinn somehow.",
        "Ridge: That's the goal.",
        "Liam: By the way, I see what you were talking about earlier, the way that Quinn is with you -- all the teasing and the taunting and the flirting. She was flirting with you. What is that about?",
        "Ridge: I don't know. And I don't know how stupid she is or how gullible she is, but you saw there was a vibe there, right? She was going --",
        "Liam: Yeah, there was, and you're not crazy, but it doesn't track because she appears to like being married to your father, you know.",
        "Ridge: No, it doesn't track, but here's something that you're forgetting. She is the most destructive person in the world. So, if there's even a little glimpse of hope that we can do this, that we can bring down Quinn Fuller... I have to take it."
