        "Olivia: What are you doing here?",
        "Carrie: One, two, three, four, five. They're all together at last, Maryanne. Together at last. First there's Alan, the driver, the instigator. I shall have to think up something really special for him. And then there's Ed, the doctor. So close to self-destruction that all he'll need is a little push. And Josh. Oh, Josh, the poster boy for hearth and home. Well, Josh, you've made it almost too easy for me.",
        "(Laughter and talking)",
        "Josh: Hi.",
        "Reva: Where have you been? They're ganging up on me.",
        "Josh: Well, we can't have that, can we?",
        "Reva: No. Come in. Hurry. What -- Are you sure you're okay?",
        "Josh: Yes, I'm okay. I'm fine, thank you. Have the games begun?",
        "Reva: No, just the playing. It's us against Generation Y.",
        "Josh: Okay. Well, you know, there's something that I should tell you, though. I can't really stay long.",
        "Reva: What?",
        "Josh: I just have something I have to do with Billy. I'm going to meet him in, like, an hour or so. Hey, sweetheart.",
        "Marah: Hey, Dad.",
        "Josh: How are you, darling?",
        "Marah: Good, thanks.",
        "Shayne: Hey, Dad.",
        "Josh: Hey, son. How are you?",
        "Sandy: Hey, Josh. You like anchovies on your pizza?",
        "Josh: It's not going to matter because I'm not going to be able to be here when it's delivered.",
        "Reva: Well, I hope it's not something that's so important that you have to rush off to Billy.",
        "Marah: What are you doing? You guys have a celebration or something going on?",
        "Josh: Uh...",
        "Carrie: And Billy. Oh, Billy. Our tough-talking, tee-totaling cowboy. Well, you're about to fall off that old wagon, pardner.",
        "Bartender: What'll it be? Another napkin?",
        "Billy: Just a club soda, please. Thank you. Uh, barkeep, uh... On second, thought, I'll have a bourbon -- the best bourbon you got. Put it on the rocks and make it a double.",
        "Carrie: And Buzz Cooper, our soldier boy. All for one and one for all. You'd all die for each other, wouldn't you? But not for a lady. Oh, no, ladies are expendable. That is, until tonight, boys.",
        "Buzz: No, I can't wait for the truck to get here. Look, you're an hour late already and I'm closing early. I'll take delivery in the morning. In the morning! Idiot.",
        "Frank: Who's the real idiot, Dad?",
        "Buzz: Well, I...",
        "Frank: Yeah, that's right. I found it. Of course it really wasn't hard, being that you left it on the counter over there for everybody to find. You've got a loaded .45, you've got extra ammo in the duffel bag. What the hell is wrong with you? Is there something going on I should know something about in the neighborhood, Pop? Assaults? Break-ins? Anything?",
        "Buzz: No.",
        "Frank: Is somebody threatening your life?",
        "Buzz: Frank, come on. Look, you know, I made a careless mistake, okay? I'm guilty. Get your blue shirts in here, flog me publicly.",
        "Frank: What's going on?",
        "Buzz: I'm not crazy about being interrogated.",
        "Frank: I asked you a direct question. I want to know what is going on and especially with this.",
        "Buzz: I'll get rid of the gun. After tonight, you'll never see it again.",
        "Frank: Where are you going?",
        "Buzz: I've got a few things I've got to clean up.",
        "Reva: Why don't you ask Billy to come over here? I mean, we don't have a pool table but we do have game and pizza with anchovies.",
        "Josh: This is way, way too domestic for Billy. You know that.",
        "Marah: Well, tell him we were thinking about him anyway.",
        "Josh: I will. He'll appreciate that, I'm sure.",
        "Reva: Well, maybe we can have him over another time, when pool isn't so pressing.",
        "Josh: You know, the bottom line is, he's not very good at games like this, anyway.",
        "Marah: Well, hey, that better not run in the family, because you are on my team.",
        "Josh: Oh.",
        "Marah: Change of plans.",
        "Shayne: Okay, it's like that. Well, then, you know what? That's fine, because you're both going down. Shuffle the cards, my man. Mom, you're on a winning team tonight.",
        "Reva: Don't I know it.",
        "Olivia: You cannot tell Phillip that Emma's alive.",
        "Cassie: I understand that's what you want, but is it what Phillip needs?",
        "Olivia: Phillip needs help. He needs to get better.",
        "Cassie: Okay, is he not well enough to hear some really good news?",
        "Olivia: No, Cassie, he isn't.",
        "Cassie: Okay, well, I just want to see that for myself.",
        "Olivia: No. Listen to me. Just... just... I know this is hard for you, okay? It's hard for me, too. Do you think it's easy for me to tell Phillip and the whole world that my baby is dead? I'm not doing this for sport, Cassie. I'm doing it because Emma could die if Lizzie finds out she's alive.",
        "Cassie: Okay. But there has to be another way for us to...",
        "Olivia: I will not compromise where my child's life is at stake.",
        "Cassie: So you're just going to keep this illusion going for Phillip?",
        "Olivia: Until things are safe, yes.",
        "Cassie: Okay, but, you know, did you stop to think that maybe Phillip is stuck in this place because he can't get over the grief of losing his daughter?",
        "Olivia: I know. It's all so unfair, isn't it? But what was fair about Lizzie's pathological jealousy of me when I was pregnant?",
        "Cassie: Nothing. In her mind, she thought you were coming between her and her father.",
        "Olivia: Yeah, in her twisted mind, that meant I deserved to die -- or my baby did -- and she did her best to make both happen.",
        "Cassie: Olivia, when we let fear rule our lives, it affects everybody in it.",
        "Olivia: I will protect my child no matter what. Isn't that how you feel about your kids?",
        "Cassie: Absolutely. But, Olivia...",
        "Olivia: But what? What? You've never had to do something you didn't like to keep them safe?",
        "Cassie: Not like this.",
        "Olivia: (Laughs bitterly) Well, you work with the cards you're dealt. Look, Phillip couldn't handle Lizzie's problems when he was 100% himself. Do you really think he's going to be able to control her when he's in the state that he's in?",
        "Cassie: That depends how out of it he really is.",
        "Olivia: Cassie, don't do this. Okay? Don't go in there, really. He needs help. He doesn't need another shock to his system.",
        "Cassie: Olivia, I'm going to keep that in mind. I will.",
        "Olivia: Cassie.",
        "Cassie: Look. Hey. I will. Hey, Phillip. Hey, Phillip.",
        "Phillip: Hi.",
        "Cassie: Sorry. I guess you weren't expecting company.",
        "Phillip: No. Not tonight, no.",
        "Cassie: Hey, you're married, huh? Congratulations.",
        "Phillip: Married again.",
        "Cassie: Well, that's okay, as long as you get it right. (Laughs) You know what I want to do? I want to have a really big party for you guys when you get out of here.",
        "Phillip: (Laughs weakly) A coming-out party. (Laughs)",
        "Cassie: Yeah, I guess, if that's what you want to call it. (Laughs) It'll be fun.",
        "Olivia: Now, Cassie, I don't think that a party's such a great idea. Right away. I mean, I'm going to need Phillip's attention to help me set up our new home.",
        "Cassie: Oh. Do you know where you're going to live?",
        "Olivia: No. No, I'm still looking, but wherever we end up, it's going to be the sweetest, coziest place you can imagine.",
        "Phillip: For babies.",
        "Cassie: Babies?",
        "Olivia: James and Zach will want to come visit us.",
        "Phillip: It's nice to see you.",
        "Cassie: Yeah. I'm sorry it took me so long to get here. How are you, Phillip? How are you?",
        "Phillip: I've been better.",
        "Cassie: Well, you're improving, right?",
        "Phillip: Yeah, I am. When I first heard about the baby, it was the most terrible pain. But Olivia, she helped me through.",
        "Cassie: Did she?",
        "Phillip: Yeah, I had no idea how awful... Well, you know.",
        "Cassie: Yeah.",
        "Phillip: Yeah. I want to tell you I'm sorry.",
        "Ray: Hey.",
        "Billy: Father.",
        "Ray: Scotch?",
        "Billy: No, no. Bourbon.",
        "Ray: Pretty color.",
        "Billy: Yeah. Nothing like it in the whole world.",
        "Ray: You really don't want that drink.",
        "Billy: I wouldn't bet on that, Father.",
        "Ray: I'm not a betting man.",
        "Billy: You're just going for lost causes and sure things, huh?",
        "Ray: Actually, I don't believe in either.",
        "Billy: Well, Father, we all make mistakes. That you can bet on.",
        "Ray: That drink is not going to give you the comfort you're looking for.",
        "Billy: I'll give it a shot or two on the rocks.",
        "Ray: I don't buy it. Otherwise you would have downed it already.",
        "Billy: Well, you see, I'm just toying with it. I'm seeing how long I can hold out.",
        "Ray: You can hold out for the rest of your life -- one day at a time.",
        "Billy: Well, Father, we all need comfort.",
        "Ray: Isn't there another way you can get it?",
        "Billy: If there were, I wouldn't be an alcoholic.",
        "Ray: Maybe you need to explore other options. Billy, talking through your problems won't give you a hangover.",
        "Billy: Talking. You mean like in confession?",
        "Ray: If that's the form it takes, yeah.",
        "Billy: You hear confessions from people who aren't of the persuasion?",
        "Ray: I hear confessions all the time, official and otherwise. You'd be surprised what the sight of this collar leads people to say. Especially in a bar.",
        "Billy: And you have to keep it to yourself even if it's one of these \"unofficial\" confessions?",
        "Ray: That's right. You know, I take back what I said before. That is a sure thing. So try me, instead of that.",
        "Billy: Well, now, you see, Father, the thing about bourbon is, it doesn't get all upset and righteous when you tell it you've done something rotten and you've jammed your little brother along with you. That's when you need comfort, when things have gotten as bad as they can get, you don't think they can get any worse, and... then they do.",
        "Buzz: (Sighs)",
        "(Gunshots)",
        "Cassie: Phillip, I don't know what you would have to apologize to me for.",
        "Phillip: I had no idea how devastating it is to lose a child, and I do now. I wish I could have helped.",
        "Cassie: There's nothing you could have done. I mean, Richard and I, we just had to go through it.",
        "Phillip: Olivia was by herself when our daughter died.",
        "Olivia: That wasn't your fault. I'm the one who left town and didn't tell anybody where I was going.",
        "Phillip: That's because I wouldn't listen. I didn't protect you and the baby from Lizzie.",
        "Cassie: Well, you know what? All that's over.",
        "Phillip: Hm.",
        "Cassie: Right?",
        "Phillip: Hm. I don't think it will ever be over. Because if I had done more, if I had just... if I trusted a little bit more, my daughter would still be alive. Do you... I think about what she would look like.",
        "Cassie: You know, you're just going to have to focus on other things.",
        "Phillip: When does the pain stop?",
        "Cassie: Never. But you know what? Everyone's reality is different. What about you, Olivia?",
        "Olivia: What about me, Cassie?",
        "Cassie: Do you still feel the pain? Do you? Do you still ache for your little girl?",
        "Ray: Whatever situation you and Josh are in, I doubt it's anything I haven't heard before.",
        "Billy: Well, I guess we'll never know now, will we, Father?",
        "Ray: Did you ever hear of reverse pride?",
        "Billy: No, I can't say that I have.",
        "Ray: It's when someone imagines they're the worst kind of sinner -- beyond salvation, a lost cause. They blow their mistakes up in their mind until they lose sight of what it is they actually did.",
        "Billy: Well, you know, I can see people getting all puffed up with their mistakes and their sorrow. But... well, I'm not bragging here, but I really did something pretty terrible. And you know, it seems like it was just yesterday.",
        "Ray: That this thing happened? Or that you were drunk last? Billy, I wish you'd tell me about it.",
        "Billy: I think I'm going to pass on it.",
        "Ray: You need to talk to somebody -- somebody you can trust.",
        "Billy: Yeah, well, I can count those on one finger, and he already knows.",
        "Ray: Josh?",
        "Billy: Yeah. And besides him, I've kind of run out of options, if you know what I mean.",
        "Ray: You're forgetting the guy with the franchise. With a little prayer, God can forgive anything.",
        "Billy: Well, that's why he's God. But you see, us mortals can be kind of a tall order, and there are people out there, Father, who only want revenge. You get yourself hooked up with one of these people, there comes a time where it is best to do unto them before they do unto you.",
        "Ray: I'm sorry you feel that way, because that's a really sad philosophy to live by.",
        "Billy: Well, maybe that's why I'm the drunk and you're the priest. Here. It's a shame to let that go to waste. Matter of fact, where I come from, it's considered a sin.",
        "Ed: Hey, Frank. Is your dad around? Is he back in the kitchen or something?",
        "Frank: Uh, no. I'm sorry, you just missed him, actually. Excuse me.",
        "Ed: Did he happen to say where he was going?",
        "Frank: No, he did not. Well, actually, he mentioned something about cleaning something up. I'm sorry. Can you excuse me?",
        "Holly: Hello, stranger. I believe you've been avoiding me.",
        "Ed: Hey. I do owe you a call. I'm sorry. I'm terrible.",
        "Holly: No, you're not terrible. You're just, what, busy and a little tired, I guess?",
        "Ed: Yeah, you don't know the half of it. Don't look at me that way. I know I look like hell.",
        "Holly: Well, you're allowed. It's not permanent, right?",
        "Ed: No. Actually, I'm hoping that things are going to change pretty soon.",
        "Holly: Great. Why don't you sit down?",
        "Ed: I...",
        "Holly: Come on.",
        "Ed: Okay.",
        "Holly: Now, I hear that you're taking time off from Cedars.",
        "Ed: Well, that's not permanent, either.",
        "Holly: Uh-huh. Coffee?",
        "Ed: No, thank you. The last thing I need is caffeine. Not a good thing when a doctor's hands start shaking.",
        "Holly: Looks like this break is coming at the perfect time, huh? I haven't seen you at any meetings.",
        "Ed: Well, I haven't been going. I mean, I know that's a cardinal sin in AA, second only to drinking. Which I'm not doing.",
        "Holly: Good.",
        "Ed: I am sorry I've been out of touch.",
        "Holly: Well, it's okay. If you wanted to call me, your would have called me, right? Maybe you're avoiding everybody, huh?",
        "Ed: In a way.",
        "Holly: Well, I've had times when I've needed to pull back and just let everything quiet down. I mean, it's great when you recognize what it is you need to do.",
        "Ed: Wow.",
        "Holly: What?",
        "Ed: Nothing. Just acceptance.",
        "Holly: Oh, well, that. Hey, you know, I have to fight reality enough with myself; I try not to do it with my friends.",
        "Ed: Even when your friends have disappeared on you?",
        "Holly: Well, I can be disappointed, but I won't make you wrong, okay?",
        "Ed: Oh, you've been going to a lot of meetings, haven't you?",
        "(Laughter)",
        "Holly: You're not the only introspective mess in this town. (Laughs) Just tell me you're okay.",
        "Ed: I can't go quite that far. People have been telling me that I haven't been meeting my problems. I've been hiding them, you know? So I can say that at least I am now going to try to meet them head-on.",
        "Holly: You know, when you get on the other side of whatever it is you're going through, maybe we could have dinner or...",
        "Ed: Absolutely. Go someplace nice. Normal.",
        "Holly: Normal. Aha. Yeah. Call me. (Laughs)",
        "Ed: Maybe tomorrow. Thank you.",
        "Carrie: It was here. It was here that it all began. Alan... Alan, you were standing there. And Josh and Billy, there, inseparable as usual. And Ed -- Ed and Buzz where there. I was here, too, that night, but you didn't know that, did you? No. Maryanne and I decided to come to the fair. We thought it would be such a lark. I left her for a moment. I left her to go and get some drinks. When I looked over and I saw that the five of you were with her, laughing and talking. I thought I saw... I thought I saw you, Alan. I thought I saw you put something in the pitcher of beer, but I couldn't be sure. And Maryanne seemed so happy, so carefree. And then... then you all got up and you got into a car. I came over and then I saw it. I saw that vial of drugs on the ground. I tried to follow you. I got in my car, but it was so dark and the roads were so... and I... I got to Cutter's Bridge and I saw the skid marks. And I... I saw the shattered railing and I knew. Oh. I knew. I got out of the car and I went down the riverbank and then I saw you. I saw all five of you. And no Maryanne anywhere in sight. I hid. I hid in the shadows and I watched you. I watched you while you made that pact. I watched you when you said you would forget Maryanne. It would be as though she had never existed. I saw you all walk away from the river without a backward glance and I swore then that I would hunt you down, wherever you were, and I would make you pay. You were going to forget Maryanne. Forget Maryanne? Maryanne will be seared into your memories for the rest of your life, because this time it's your daughters' life that's at stake.",
        "Marah: Oh, you're killing me here!",
        "Sandy: All you have to do is answer the question: What disaster happened on May 6, 1937, Lakehurst, New Jersey?",
        "Reva: What are you doing?",
        "Marah: Oh, I know. It's the crash of the Hindenburg.",
        "Reva: He told her!",
        "(Cheers and arguing)",
        "(Good-natured arguing)",
        "Marah: Get out of here.",
        "Josh: I have to go. I'm sorry.",
        "Shayne: Yeah, that's right. Go ahead and leave while you're behind. Go ahead.",
        "Josh: Hey, back away.",
        "Reva: I'll walk you out.",
        "Marah: Things are going to be really good from now on.",
        "Josh: Yes, they are. I love you.",
        "Marah: I love you, too. Bye.",
        "Josh: I love you, son.",
        "Shayne: I love you, too, Daddy.",
        "Josh: Take care. I'm sorry, I just lost track of the time, that's all.",
        "Reva: Uh-huh. Well, I'm glad you could spend at least a little time with us.",
        "Josh: Me, too. It was terrific.",
        "Reva: Good. Then we'll do it again, soon. Are you sure you're okay? You seem distracted.",
        "Josh: I'm fine, really.",
        "Reva: Give Billy my love.",
        "Josh: I will.",
        "Reva: 'Night.",
        "Josh: See you.",
        "Carrie: After all these years, this is where it will end.",
        "Olivia: You know, Cassie, I think Phillip needs to be cheered up, not dragged into the past.",
        "Phillip: I brought it up.",
        "Cassie: No, it's okay. You know, she's just thinking about what's best for you.",
        "Olivia: Well, that's what a wife should do, isn't it?",
        "Cassie: Yeah. Sure. I'm going to go now, okay?",
        "Phillip: It was really nice seeing you, Cassie.",
        "Cassie: You, too, Phillip. You know, about your daughter... I really hope that your pain eases a lot sooner than mine did. And I really have a feeling that if all goes well, it should.",
        "Olivia: I'll be right back. Cassie. Thank you.",
        "Cassie: Don't thank me, okay? I feel like a louse. Do you look at him when you go in there? Do you? Do you see him when you go in there? Because it is eating him up inside.",
        "Olivia: I thought you understood.",
        "Cassie: I do understand. I understand why you want to keep him in the dark. I do. But what's going on there is not human. He is suffering.",
        "Olivia: Listen to me. Sometimes you have to do things that hurt to protect people. You of all people should know that.",
        "Cassie: Don't. Don't do that. Don't bring my kids into this, okay?",
        "Olivia: I'm not talking about your kids. I'm talking about what you did for Danny. You know, after Carmen shot him. Everyone thought he was dead -- even his wife. But you knew better, didn't you, Cassie? You saved his life. But in order to keep him alive, what did you have to do? Hm?",
        "Cassie: I've got to go.",
        "Olivia: No. Tell me what you had to do. You kept the truth to yourself and a few other people that you absolutely had to tell, Michelle not among them.",
        "Cassie: It's not the same thing.",
        "Olivia: Oh, it's the same thing. You deliberately kept someone who was heartbroken and grieving from knowing that the person they were mourning wasn't dead, to protect that person from actually being killed. Now, you tell me how what I'm doing is so different. If you could have saved Danny's life any other way, wouldn't you have done it?",
        "Cassie: How do you think he is going to react when he finds out the truth about Emma?",
        "Olivia: I don't know, but I'll handle it.",
        "Cassie: You're going to handle it? Olivia, he threw you out when he thought Emma wasn't his child. This is a thousand times worse.",
        "Olivia: That's a risk I'll have to take.",
        "Cassie: You just got married. That's how you want to start your new life with him?",
        "Olivia: (Laughs) Cassie. Maybe he'll blow up at me. Maybe he'll try and strangle me again. Who knows? I just know this: No matter how much it hurt me that he couldn't bring himself to believe that I was telling the truth about who Emma's father was, no man can hurt me that badly again. So in the meanwhile, I have to be both parents to Emma, because Phillip can't protect her from inside a sanitarium.",
        "Cassie: Well, you're not giving him a chance.",
        "Olivia: Did you just see him? Is that a man who can protect his family? He can't even get out of bed.",
        "Cassie: So you're just going to be both parents for Emma.",
        "Olivia: That's right. Some decisions are tough, Cassie.",
        "Cassie: Hey, be tough. Yeah. Just don't be cruel.",
        "Olivia: What are you talking about?",
        "Cassie: Hey. I am all for what you're doing. I say, protect your daughter. Yeah. Don't let Lizzie anywhere near her and you keep her away from the Spaulding mansion.",
        "Olivia: Yeah, I don't really think that's a problem.",
        "Cassie: You can still let Phillip know that his baby's...",
        "Olivia: How? How? How do I do that and guarantee her safety?",
        "Cassie: You go get her and you bring her here, Olivia. And then you trust your husband.",
        "Reva: So, to the winners go the dirty dishes?",
        "Marah: Ha-ha.",
        "Shayne: So, who won? Was that close?",
        "Reva: Loser. Loser!",
        "(Laughter)",
        "Sandy: We're all winners here.",
        "Marah: They are so gracious, aren't they? Well, this wasn't so bad.",
        "Sandy: No, it was actually kind of fun.",
        "Marah: And you and Mom seem to be getting along pretty well.",
        "Sandy: The up-side of lowered expectations.",
        "Marah: Ah. Always a good policy with her.",
        "Sandy: So, do you have a pool game lined up, too, or a hot date?",
        "Marah: No, neither.",
        "Sandy: So, speaking of hot dates, how'd the Valentine's thing at the Country Club...",
        "Marah: Uh-huh. As if you didn't know.",
        "Sandy: What are you talking about?",
        "Marah: I think that it was very sweet of you to set it up so that Jeffrey and I could be together. Sneaky, but sweet.",
        "Sandy: You're praising in error. Why would I want you to go out with Mr. Know- It-All O'Neill?",
        "Marah: Oh, brother, would you just shut up and let me thank you. Take it.",
        "Sandy: You're welcome. So, was it great?",
        "Marah: It had its share of magic in a sensible, logical kind of way.",
        "Sandy: Wait. Don't tell me I'd hand-delivered the guy a valentine and he wasn't appreciative of it.",
        "Marah: (Clears throat)This... the basic situation between Jeffrey and I is still the same: We like each other, but we just met at the wrong time, I guess.",
        "Sandy: Bummer.",
        "Marah: No. No. It gives me more time to work on my designs and play stupid games with my brothers. (Laughs) Besides, I have a new project that I'm working on: I'm going to find you a date.",
        "Sandy: Ah, the new family project.",
        "Marah: Yes.",
        "Sandy: Lose that idea. Unless you know someone who can help me out with costumes at the school play.",
        "Marah: Hm. I'll have to get back to you on that one. I am going to head out of here, so I'll see you later. All right?",
        "Sandy: All right. Bye.",
        "Marah: Bye, Mom! Bye, Shayne!",
        "Reva: Where's she going?",
        "(Door closes)",
        "Marah: Are you ready to go to the fairground? I know, but if this memorial is what it takes to get Carrie out of town, then I'm all for it. Okay, I will meet you at the Museum, then. Oh, don't forget to put on that stupid ring that Carrie said. Okay? Bye.",
        "Billy: Hey.",
        "Buzz: Hey.",
        "Billy: Soldier boy.",
        "Buzz: You seen anything?",
        "Billy: No, no. Let me tell you, this place just gives me the willies. Whoa. Nice to see you right on time.",
        "Josh: Yeah, well, this is not the kind of thing I would be late for. Who knows, maybe we'll get lucky. Maybe she won't show.",
        "Buzz: Well, she's here.",
        "Josh: Next, on Guiding Light...",
        "Olivia: I'm in control, Cassie. Not Phillip, not Lizzie, not the rest of the Spauldings -- me.",
        "Carrie: One of you girls must die to balance the scales. You must choose."
