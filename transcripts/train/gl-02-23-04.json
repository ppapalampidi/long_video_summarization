        "The men arrive at the Fairgrounds, as per Carrie's orders, and at first she is nowhere to be found. Odd music beings to play from the adjacent funhouse and they go inside to investigate. There, they come face to face with a veritable maze of mirrors and they immediately lose their sense of space. Finally, Carrie's voice is heard and a dozen images of her appear all at once, but it is still unclear which is really Carrie and which are reflections. Carrie tells them that tonight is the night of reckoning and that to repay for what happened to Maryanne, one of the girls must lose their life. The men go ballistic but Carrie insists that if they don't pick one, she'll do the picking herself. Marah is having second thoughts about accepting Carrie's invitation to go to the fairgrounds. But Michelle and Marina, already under the influence from the drug Carrie applied to their rings, convince her to go. The girls arrive and go inside the funhouse where they hear music playing. Josh sees Marah first and tries to yell for her to leave but she's in a daze and doesn't hear him. Carrie sees Marah too and starts to pull out her gun. Cassie confronts Olivia about the secret she's keeping from Phillip and insists that part of the reason he's in Ravenwood is because he blames himself for what happened. Olivia stands her ground and says that she's scared of what will happen if Lizzie learns of the baby's existence. Cassie insists that both she and Phillip will protect the secret but if Olivia doesn't tell him, Cassie will. Realizing that she has no choice, Olivia promises to tell Phillip the truth after she takes care of one last thing. Olivia then meets with a well- dressed man to discuss papers of an unknown agenda."

    "Transcript": [
        "Olivia: You've lost your mind. You've lost it.",
        "Cassie: This is as wrong as it gets in life. You are purposely allowing a man to believe his child, your child, died at birth.",
        "Olivia: I have told you. I have been telling you why.",
        "Cassie: I don't care. I don't care. Or maybe I care in a way that you don't like. I regret every second I wasted backing you on this.",
        "Olivia: You agreed that this was the right thing to do!",
        "Cassie: There is nothing right about this. This is a decision made out of fear. I only went along with it because I thought it was your decision.",
        "Olivia: It still is, Cassie.",
        "Cassie: Well, you know what? It's really easy to make a decision when you don't come face-to-face with the consequences. Do you see Phillip? I mean, do you see him?",
        "Olivia: I see him. I see him every day. But I also see what could happen if I did tell him.",
        "Cassie: Lizzie.",
        "Olivia: What do you want me to do? What do you want me to do?! Do you want me to keep reliving the same nightmare with that child? I have gone down that road, where I thought I could protect my daughter from her, but I couldn't. Okay? And no one in that family can control her. She did everything she could to run me out of Springfield while I was pregnant, Cassie. She wanted me dead!",
        "Cassie: I know that you have been through a lot, but so has Phillip. And you are part of the reason why he is suffering like this.",
        "Olivia: What are you? Another Spaulding? Everything is my fault.",
        "Cassie: That man is convinced that he killed his child. Now, you can't give me one good reason why he should be in there suffering like that. Okay, you say that you care about Phillip, but when you married him, you married into his life in the community, you married into his family and his company and all that comes with it.",
        "Olivia: Well, look at me. I've been found out.",
        "Cassie: I don't know, Olivia. Maybe you have.",
        "Marina: It ends tonight -- the roller coaster of pain, of suffering, of sadness. Fun ride.",
        "Michelle: You know, I didn't think I had it in me to feel sorry for Carrie when she asked for this memorial.",
        "Marina: Yeah, me either. We're going, aren't we?",
        "Michelle: Yeah. Yeah, honoring Maryanne feels right. She was innocent, right? Going there tonight is the best way to put this whole thing to rest.",
        "Marah: Or not. I'm not going, and I don't think either of you should.",
        "Billy: I'm getting tired of this. Anybody know where the box is, so I can shut these lights off?",
        "Buzz: I don't know. I haven't been here for ages.",
        "(Noise in distance)",
        "Billy: What was that?",
        "Alan: Who turned on these lights?",
        "Buzz: We haven't seen anybody. Have you?",
        "Ed: No, nothing.",
        "Billy: This is turning into a freak show.",
        "Buzz: All we're missing is the freak.",
        "Alan: Any sign of her?",
        "Josh: Well, obviously somebody turned on the lights.",
        "Buzz: We're being set up. We didn't pick the field of engagement, but we sure are stumbling into it blindly.",
        "Josh: Buzz is right. We have no advantage here. We have no way of knowing what's coming.",
        "Alan: This started three decades ago. If we leave, the wheel keeps turning. If we stay, we could end it all now.",
        "Ed: Why are we walking into this woman's spider web?",
        "Billy: Come on, guys. What did you expect? For us to show up here and get into a big group hug with Carrie and she'd forgive us? No. This is her chance to torture us for what happened to Maryanne. It's her game. Unfortunately, it's her rules, too.",
        "Alan: We'll play by her rules \u0091til we find out what she wants, and then we'll deal with it.",
        "Josh: \"Deal with it,\" Alan?",
        "Alan: Deal with it, and then we will get your girls out of this nightmare in one piece.",
        "(Carnival music starts)",
        "Buzz: Well, that would seem to be our cue. Are we ready?",
        "Josh: Let's do it.",
        "Billy: All right.",
        "Billy: You coming, Buzz?",
        "Buzz: Yeah. I've got your back.",
        "Sandy: \"To Dad from Shayne, five years old, Camp Pemagawasset.\" Guess you weren't there for him either, Reva.",
        "Reva: Oh, don't you dare! I know you're not leaving.",
        "Sandy: Something like it.",
        "Reva: (Laughs) Without saying good-bye?",
        "Sandy: Sorry. Good-bye.",
        "Reva: No, come over here quick. Help me with this. (Laughs)",
        "Sandy: Okay, okay. It's a little early for spring cleaning.",
        "Reva: Yeah, well, just call me the Queen of Projects. Anyway, it keeps me out of trouble -- most of the time. Right here, that's good. So, when I was looking for the game that we played tonight, this is what I came across.",
        "Sandy: A box.",
        "Reva: Oh, not just any box. This is a box of Lewis Family memories. I mean, most of it's junk, but some of it tells a real story. Now, your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to dive right in.",
        "Sandy: And I'm supposed to just figure out what's what.",
        "Reva: No, no. I'll interpret for you. You will be the designated sorter. Come on, I need the help. Marah and Josh left, and Shayne's upstairs tweaking his computer or something. Besides, you have absolutely no escape.",
        "Sandy: So, you want me to take a drive down memory lane for a full tour of the Lewis Family's Greatest Hits.",
        "Reva: Yeah. Please?",
        "Sandy: Because, of course, you couldn't just do this yourself.",
        "Reva: Well, no, I could, but it wouldn't be nearly half the fun.",
        "Sandy: You're assuming this is going to be fun?",
        "Reva: Sandy, I know that when you start going through all this stuff, you may feel a little lost at first, maybe left out or ignored.",
        "Sandy: Maybe because I was?",
        "Reva: That's the damage that I'd like to try to repair so that we can both start healing.",
        "Sandy: How much are you paying?",
        "Reva: What do you want?",
        "Sandy: Cookies. Giant ones. Of the soft-baked, chocolate chip variety?",
        "Reva: Cookies?",
        "Sandy: Mm-hmm.",
        "Reva: I can do cookies. You start digging.",
        "Sandy: You start baking.",
        "Reva: (Laughs)",
        "(Carnival music playing)",
        "Sandy: You know, when I was little, I used to see these in store windows and... Reva? Are you okay, Reva?",
        "Reva: Uh. Uh, yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. What were you saying?",
        "Sandy: When I was little, I always wished someone would get me one of these. I'm not going to get all jealous or weepy. Is this Marah's or Shayne's? Reva? Is this like the other day? Are you having one of your things?",
        "Reva: You know what I really do... what I need to do is take a break from all these feelings that I'm having. I'm sorry. It's very sweet of you to worry about me, but it was really nothing.",
        "(Carnival music playing)",
        "Josh: Everyone stay close.",
        "Buzz: Oh, no. This isn't going to be dangerous or confusing at all, here.",
        "Ed: We're playing on her turf now, aren't we?",
        "Josh: Well, maybe we should be thinking about getting the hell out of here then.",
        "Billy: Maybe, but I don't think we should negotiate from a position of weakness. What do you think, Alan?",
        "Alan: Well, that's what we're doing, gentlemen. All right, Caroline! Show yourself, and let's get this over with!",
        "Ed: Oh, Alan, she's not going to come out and discuss... discuss with us, you know, how she's going to stick it to us. We left her niece to die.",
        "Josh: We know what we did, Ed.",
        "Ed: It's like pigs to slaughter in here.",
        "Billy: Hey, hey, Ed. Ed, just calm down. Calm down, okay?",
        "Ed: You don't have to tell me to calm down, Billy.",
        "Alan: Wait. Did you hear that?",
        "Ed: Wait, look at that. What's that?",
        "Josh: She's here.",
        "Buzz: Stay tight.",
        "Alan: All right, Caroline. We can play games all night. What was it you said, Ed? We're like \"pigs to slaughter?\"",
        "Michelle: What's the matter, Marah?",
        "Marah: What isn't the matter since Carrie came into our lives?",
        "Michelle: Well, do you think she's up to something?",
        "Marah: I don't know. Why wouldn't she be?",
        "Marina: I realize there were no farewell hugs and kisses, but wasn't this thing with Carrie supposed to be over? I mean, we told her to back off, and she did, end of story.",
        "Michelle: I just have this feeling, and, you know, it's not a bad one. It's just, like... I don't know, something's just different.",
        "Marah: But isn't going to meet Carrie tonight just drawing this whole thing out? Maybe we should just blow her off.",
        "Michelle: See, last night I was thinking about why we agreed to do this good- bye for Maryanne, and then the more I thought about it, the more peaceful I felt, you know, just really peaceful. And I just know that what she's asking us to do is the right thing. I know it. I don't know, it's hard to describe. Maybe I think... maybe these rings really do have some sort of, like, a power.",
        "Marina: Yeah, but Carrie said the power was in us and not in the rings.",
        "Michelle: Yeah, but maybe it's both. You know, and if we go there tonight and we have our rings on, Marah, I know by the end of the night you're going to have the same feeling. I just know it. You just have to, like, give in to her one more time.",
        "Olivia: You know what, Cassie? You've been a good friend to me, maybe my only friend in this town in a lot of ways.",
        "Cassie: I still am.",
        "Olivia: And yet you're implying that the only reason I married Phillip was to get my mitts on the Spaulding money.",
        "Cassie: Certain people are talking about it, Olivia.",
        "Olivia: Do I care?",
        "Cassie: You're proving them right by keeping Emma hidden away from the world.",
        "Olivia: What is this? Olivia wants to make a buck again? I don't call that original thinking on your part.",
        "Cassie: What would you have me think? You can't keep Emma hidden away forever.",
        "Olivia: Who says I can't? I can keep Emma a secret as long as I want.",
        "Cassie: Why would you?",
        "Olivia: Because of Lizzie!",
        "Cassie: Lizzie can be controlled.",
        "Olivia: Oh, right. Should I put you in charge of that?",
        "Cassie: You can't tell me that you don't see what's going on with Phillip. You can't tell me you don't see it. He doesn't deserve this, Olivia. If you had any feelings at all, you would go in there and you would put a stop to this. Look, maybe... maybe you are that afraid of Lizzie. Maybe not. But now that I've seen Phillip, I'm not giving you anymore options.",
        "Olivia: I could just leave. I could just leave. I did it before. And with all the Spaulding resources, no one could find me.",
        "Cassie: What has happened to you?",
        "Olivia: I don't like ultimatums. So I have one for you, friend. You open your mouth and Phillip not only loses the child he never knew, he loses the wife he claims to love so much. Phillip believes he owes me. I want to keep it that way.",
        "Cassie: Wow. You know, I have tried to see something different in you, something good, or at least someone who wants to do the right thing. And that's the only reason you've been able to play me, knowing how I'd feel about you losing your baby, and you used it. Even when I found out your baby was still alive, you used it. And now you're telling me that you're going to run away and take the baby with you? What, do you think I'm going to be so crushed, so upset that it's going to destroy Phillip? Is that it?",
        "Olivia: I never meant to use you.",
        "Cassie: Oh, yes, you did. You've been using me. But you know what? It's over now, Olivia, because I see what Phillip is going through, and I know how that feels. So you know what? No, you don't have anymore choices. Phillip's going to find out about his baby.",
        "Olivia: Then what, Cassie? Are you going to personally go tell Lizzie she now has the sister she never wanted?",
        "Cassie: Cut it out. Stop using the Lizzie card. You're smarter than that. Your con's over.",
        "Olivia: Oh, I don't know about that. See, I think that, so far, what I've been doing is a pretty smart play. I'm in control, Cassie. Not Phillip, not Lizzie, not her doctor -- who, ironically, is now Phillip's doctor -- not the rest of the Spauldings. Me.",
        "Cassie: And you think Phillip is too weak. You think he's too weak to stand up to Lizzie. You know why he's weak? Because he thinks he had a hand in killing his child. It's driving him insane, and you don't want him to get better.",
        "Olivia: Of course, I do.",
        "Cassie: Then you give him something to live for. He'll keep the secret about Emma if you just let him know that his daughter is alive.",
        "Olivia: How can I be sure that I can convince him to keep Emma a secret?",
        "Cassie: Well, you've convinced the whole world that your child died at birth. Phillip will believe anything you say. You got the man to marry you.",
        "Olivia: He did that out of pity.",
        "Cassie: Well, then imagine what he would do out of love for his child.",
        "Olivia: Oh, God, that's what frightens me.",
        "Cassie: Go get that little girl, and you bring her here and you save your husband.",
        "Olivia: I don't have a choice, do I?",
        "Cassie: No.",
        "Olivia: There's something I have to do first. You have backed me up against a wall and against my better judgment -- because I do love Phillip in a way you will never understand -- I'm letting you corner me, so you're going to have to trust me. I'd better not regret this.",
        "Cassie: I don't care if you do.",
        "(Carnival music playing)",
        "Sandy: What do you see?",
        "Reva: It's the music from this toy. It's like a calliope at the circus. It gives me the creeps. Maybe we shouldn't have opened this box.",
        "Sandy: Well, maybe it will help you flash back to something important, something you might need to know, that you've forgotten, like, where you lost the house keys way back when or a misplaced grocery list.",
        "Reva: You are so funny. You know something? That is twice that I have had a twinge of something when I've been around you.",
        "Sandy: Sandy, the Psychic Lightning Rod.",
        "Reva: I don't know, I can't explain it. It just seems that you make me more receptive or sensitive to something.",
        "Sandy: Does it really work like that? If you're around certain people, is it like throwing gas on a fire?",
        "Reva: Maybe it's just that we really do have a connection. Let's get back at this.",
        "Sandy: You know, I'm late for something, so...",
        "Reva: No, you're not. You're just freaking out. You are. Don't go. Please don't go.",
        "Sandy: Reva, if we are having a connection, we want it to grow, right? And that takes time. Tonight, with all the games and everything, it's a good start, right?",
        "Reva: I'm pushing again, aren't I?",
        "Sandy: A little.",
        "Reva: I'm sorry, I am. Hug? Call me.",
        "Sandy: I will.",
        "Reva: Okay?",
        "Sandy: Okay.",
        "Reva: Thanks. Thanks for coming.",
        "Sandy: Thank you.",
        "Reva: Drive safely.",
        "Sandy: Good night.",
        "Marina: I guess I never thought about it like the way that you put it, like, you know, seeking closure.",
        "Michelle: Yeah, it's like a... it's like a sense of peace.",
        "Marina: Yeah. Yeah, and I feel that, too. I mean, I feel like... I feel, like, different, you know? Like... like, good. Like I haven't felt about life in a really long time, you know? I mean, am I saying what I'm saying right now? What am I saying?",
        "Michelle: It's because we're involved in something important, you know? And we just have to see it through.",
        "Marah: But wasn't this \"important something\" bad? What about everything that Carrie did?",
        "Michelle: Marah, after everything that we've been through, don't you think that we deserve to feel better about it? I mean, don't you want this to end just, like, the right way?",
        "Marah: All right. Let's do it.",
        "Billy: Come on out, Caroline. I don't know about you guys. I was just willing to negotiate before, but now I'm getting ticked off!",
        "Carrie: Temper, temper, Billy. Anger's a dangerous emotion. It can cause you to get sloppy.",
        "Alan: There's nothing to be afraid of, Caroline. We've come here to make amends.",
        "Carrie: I'm not afraid of you. It's you who should be afraid of me.",
        "Josh: Hey, look, you wanted us all here. We're here. Now, we all want the same thing.",
        "Carrie: Oh, I doubt that.",
        "Josh: We need to find a way to put the past to rights.",
        "Carrie: You cannot put the past to rights. You cannot bring Maryanne back from the dead.",
        "Buzz: Enough with these games! Come out and tell us what you want!",
        "Carrie: I think I prefer to stay where I am: Safe and alive.",
        "Alan: Don't be ridiculous. No one here is going to kill you.",
        "Carrie: Then what was Buzz doing at the firing range today?",
        "Josh: Are you out of your mind?",
        "Buzz: I never bring a knife to a gunfight.",
        "Carrie: And never bring a gun unless you plan to use it.",
        "Josh: He won't. He won't. Just tell us what you want.",
        "Carrie: A life for a life.",
        "Billy: Whose life?",
        "Alan: One of us for Maryanne?",
        "Carrie: That wouldn't be a fair exchange, would it? Maryanne was young, full of potential.",
        "Josh: You can't be serious.",
        "Carrie: One of your girls for the one that you took from me. One of your girls must die to balance the scales. You must choose.",
        "Alan: Don't be insane!",
        "Carrie: Oh, I'm not insane, Alan. I'm just very, very angry.",
        "Cassie: Phillip? It's Cassie.",
        "Phillip: Hi. You still here?",
        "Cassie: Yeah. I could go, you know?",
        "Phillip: No. No, that's okay. I like your company. I heard voices out in the hall. Were you talking to Olivia?",
        "Cassie: Yeah. Yeah. We kind of got into it.",
        "Phillip: What about?",
        "Cassie: About you.",
        "Phillip: Always about me. I hate it. Hate it.",
        "Cassie: I can imagine. You're always at your best when you're thinking about other people.",
        "Phillip: Dr. Langham says that's what makes me crazy. What were you talking about?",
        "Cassie: Just getting you better. Getting you out of here, back on your feet again.",
        "Phillip: Too many pills, Cassie. I'm so tired all the time. And sometimes I feel like I know what I want, but I just... I can't make it happen.",
        "Cassie: I know that you feel like you're drowning, but you're going to get stronger. It's just going to take a little time and maybe a little help, you know? Help that you aren't expecting, maybe.",
        "Phillip: What do you mean?",
        "Cassie: Well, just, you know, how things happen. Those miracles that life can throw at you that just give you a little boost.",
        "Phillip: I think about you. You lost the child and you lost Richard.",
        "Cassie: You know, this is probably one of those times where you shouldn't think about other people. That's in the past.",
        "Phillip: What I can't figure out is how you got there.",
        "Cassie: Where?",
        "Phillip: To now. You managed to hold your life together. You didn't crack.",
        "Cassie: I'm permanently cracked, Phillip.",
        "Phillip: Not like I am. I go on living, but sometimes I don't know why I should.",
        "(Carnival music playing)",
        "Alan: You can't expect one of us to choose which one of their children should die.",
        "Buzz: Lady, for a minute there, I almost felt sorry for you. Now maybe I do want you out of the picture.",
        "Billy: No way, Carrie! No way!",
        "Josh: Shush-shush. Carrie, listen to me.",
        "Alan: Josh, you can't reason with her.",
        "Buzz: What are we supposed to do, lady?!",
        "Josh: You must understand that what you're asking of us is impossible.",
        "Carrie: Why? Because you say so?",
        "Alan: You're damn right because we say so.",
        "Carrie: You have no leverage. I have the advantage.",
        "Ed: Not if we can get our hands on you.",
        "Carrie: You'd love that, wouldn't you? To kill me, too.",
        "Ed: Yeah, you bet.",
        "Carrie: Why, Doctor, you're a disgrace to your profession.",
        "Ed: Listen, putting you out of your misery is the most humane act I can think of at this point.",
        "Carrie: It's been thirty years, gentlemen. Thirty years, and tonight the debt will be paid.",
        "Josh: No! You want a life, you take mine! You hear me? Take mine! You can kill me right here tonight if that's what you want, but you are not getting your hands on my daughter! Kill me! Kill me!",
        "Billy: Whoa, whoa.",
        "Carrie: And deprive myself of the pleasure of seeing you suffer?",
        "Billy: Josh, Josh, whoa-whoa. Hey, you don't negotiate with loonies. Josh, there's another way. We'll find another way. We will.",
        "Carrie: Choose!",
        "Josh: No.",
        "Billy: Josh! Josh! Just calm down. Look, nobody's going to die. Don't let her get to you. That's what she wants.",
        "Carrie: You know what I want.",
        "Ed: Well, you're never going to get it.",
        "Carrie: How do you know I don't already have it?",
        "Alan: The girls are through with you, Caroline. You won't get within a mile of them.",
        "Carrie: How can you be so sure? Young women are so impressionable. They're so easily influenced. Those girls and I have a bond, you know.",
        "Ed: In your twisted mind, I'm sure you think so.",
        "Carrie: Don't be so sure your little darlings have rejected me. I don't think they'll ever reject me ever again.",
        "Marina: This is trippy.",
        "Marah: Did Carrie set all this up?",

        "Marah: This is beautiful.",
        "Michelle: You know, I used to come here when I was a kid. It's been deserted for, like, years. I don't think it's ever been so peaceful.",
        "Marina: You know, this is cool, and I like it.",
        "Marah: Me, too. (Laughs) Look at all the lights. Whoa. Does anyone else feel weird?",
        "Marina: You mean, like good weird or just kind of, like, weird?",
        "Marah: The first one and the last one. ( Laughs)",
        "Michelle: Well, this is kind of a weird thing that we're doing, right?",
        "Marina: Yeah, yeah, I know. Like, the whole going, saying good-bye to dead people thing. Okay, you guys...",
        "(Carnival music playing)",
        "Marina: ...Music. Anyone else...?",
        "Marah: I hear it.",

        "Olivia: Good, you're here.",
        "Man: I came as quickly as I could.",
        "Olivia: Did you bring it?",
        "Man: Why all the flashing red lights?",
        "Olivia: You know, I really don't have time to explain. Just know that this is a rush job. Let's get to work.",
        "Billy: Lady, think what you want, but our girls aren't coming within a million miles of this death trap tonight.",
        "Carrie: So full of bluster. Don't you get sick of being wrong?",
        "Buzz: You'll never get to them!",
        "Carrie: Time is running out, gentlemen. Someone will die, so choose!",
        "Josh: Not one of our daughters!",
        "Alan: Maybe that someone will be you!",
        "Carrie: You have already taken away everything that ever meant anything to my life. I have nothing else to lose, so choose!",
        "Marina: I heard voices.",
        "Michelle: Was it the music?",
        "Marina: Did anyone hear voices?",
        "Marah: Yeah, I think I heard it, too.",
        "Michelle: I'm not sure. Whoa.",
        "Buzz: If she moves, we move.",
        "Billy: We're not choosing anyone.",

        "Josh: Shh...",
        "Billy: What is it?",
        "Josh: I heard a voice. It sounded like Marah.",
        "Billy: No. No, it can't be Marah.",
        "Michelle: I can't make anything out. Is that me over there?",
        "Marah: Me, too.",
        "Marina: Wow, this is awesome.",
        "Michelle: You guys, let's hold hands.",
        "Marah: Are you scared?",

        "Buzz: Let's split up.",
        "Marah: Daddy?",
        "Josh: Marah. Marah, listen to me. Get down. Get on the floor and don't move. Marah, get down! Marah, get down!",
        "Buzz: Marah, down! Now!",
        "Billy: Marah, get on the floor! Do as your Daddy says.",
