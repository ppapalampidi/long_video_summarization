        "Michelle interrupts Danny as he finalizes the arrangements for the special Valentine's benefit dance for the hotline. She hints that she's upset by her father but then begs off without leaving any details. Though he claims to be a fan of the idea of Valentine's Day, Shayne admits to Nico that he's going to the dance reluctantly because he knows Marina loves to dance. Marina opens up to Marah that she'd actually prefer to stay at home with Shayne. Hearing this, Marah enlists Sandy's help to give them a romantic date at home and asks for his help baking a cake. With Led Zeppelin playing in the background and a wig near her makeup mirror, Carrie gets ready for tonight's adventure and rehearses her words she intends to say to the men who killed Maryanne. Tony lets Danny know that he's still not sure Bruzi was behind the gas leak that almost killed Michelle. Tony warns that he's playing with fire but Danny insists he do what he tells him to do. Christopher asks Jeffrey to remove Reva from their \"project\" because she has too much going on in her personal life but Jeffrey won't hear it and guesses that he's becoming too close to Reva. Admitting she's taking her daughter, Beth urges Jeffrey to go to the benefit dance tonight because he might have a good time. Lizzie takes an interest in \"Blade\" who invites her to a rave at the warehouse on 5th Street tonight."

        "Danny: Excuse me. Cheryl, everything looks great. Really, I would just... I think we should just add some more seating over along that wall and I was thinking, also, could you put a table right here where the guests can come in and pick up information on the hotline?",
        "Manager: How would you like to handle the donation cards?",
        "Danny: Um, I think we should just put them front and center, prop them up at each place setting. What do you think?",
        "Manager: Very good, mr. Santos. Anything else?",
        "Danny: Um, yeah. Can you do me a favor? Put your best bottle of champagne on ice. I'd like to... after the party wraps up, I'd like to surprise my wife with a little celebration in the private dining room.",
        "Manager: I'll make the arrangements.",
        "Danny: Great, thank you.",
        "Manager: You're welcome.",
        "Danny: Okay. Michelle you are my favorite husband.",
        "Danny: Hey, well, I'm sure you say that to all the guys.",
        "Michelle: Oh, no. Only the ones who help me raise money for my hotline, like you.",
        "Danny: Mm-hmm.",
        "Michelle: Wow, I really like what you're doing. Cupid would be very proud.",
        "Danny: Yeah, I would hope so, since I'm doing it all for love.",
        "Michelle: Mm-hmm.",
        "Danny: Yeah, that's what i hear valentine's day is all about: Showing the people you love how much you love 'em.",
        "Michelle: Yeah.",
        "Danny: Oh, yeah?",
        "Michelle: Mm-hmm.",
        "Danny: What's the matter? You okay?",
        "Michelle:: Yeah, it's just my dad.",
        "Danny: What?",
        "Michelle: You know, he's not going to be here tonight, and--",
        "Danny: Are you, what, you never told me what went on between you two last night.",
        "Michelle: Oh, danny, it's complicated. And I have to go pick home and get some brochures.",
        "Danny: Okay, well, let me come with you.",
        "Michelle: No, danny, I'll be okay.",
        "Danny: I know. I know you'll be okay.",
        "Michelle: You don't have to follow me everywhere, then.",
        "Danny: I'm not following...",
        "Michelle: What happened the other night with the gas? That was an accident, right? Okay?",
        "Danny: I know.",
        "Michelle: I've got to go.",
        "Danny: Okay.",
        "Michelle: I'll see you later.",
        "Christopher: You are very welcome. I hope that works out for you. Beth, hi! Glad you could make it.",
        "Beth: Well, thank you for inviting us. (Cell phone rings) oh, darn. I better take this. Excuse me.",
        "Christopher: So, lizzie, how are you?",
        "Lizzie: I'm doing good, and how are you? Oh, are we on the clock? I thought you were just making small talk.",
        "Christopher: I know you've been dealing with a lot lately with your father's illness and his marriage.",
        "Lizzie: No, actually, I'm okay with it. Well, not okay, okay, but I mean I'm getting over it. I'm dealing with the whole shotgun marriage thing and i figure the more I worry about what happened with olivia, the less energy I have, and emotion to put into my being happy. Does that sound familiar?",
        "Christopher: It sounds like something I would say.",
        "Lizzie: Yes, you did, in our session last week. See, I do listen. No, I'm just over this whole drama thing. I want to be a normal kid. Yes, and I'm going to stay out of trouble.",
        "Christopher: Good, lizzie.",
        "Nico: Mm, these burgers are heart-shaped.",
        "Shayne: Yes, they are.",
        "Nico: This town is all about valentine's day. You know what? It's really starting to make me sick.",
        "Shayne: Feel the love, nico. Feel the love.",
        "Nico: I went shopping for danny and michelle this week...",
        "Shayne: Mm-hmm.",
        "Nico: Pink and red streamers on every aisle. And I filled my tank up before i came home-- doily-hearts in the gas station window. Come on, shayne. Doilies?",
        "Shayne: I don't know, man. I'm kind of into the whole valentine's day thing this year. You know? I mean, I guess if you have the right girl, then it's good.",
        "Nico: So, you and marina going to the dance?",
        "Shayne: Mm-hmm. Yup.",
        "Nico: Hey, where's the enthusiasm, mr. \"I'm into valentine's day?\" You didn't get to take her to the new year's eve dance.",
        "Nico: Yeah, I know, you did!",
        "Shayne: She was talking about you the whole time. You should be psyched that you have the opportunity to take her to this thing.",
        "Shayne: Yeah, well, I thought I would be. Ah, I thought that if I could stand even on my crutches then i could dance, sort of.",
        "Nico: So, then what's the problem?",
        "Shayne: I'd just rather... honestly, I'd rather just skip the dance and stay at home with her, the two of us alone.",
        "Nico: Quiet night at home?",
        "Shayne: Yeah.",
        "Nico: Okay, old man.",
        "Shayne: Shut up, dude, listen. It doesn't even matter what i want, okay? She loves to dance. And even though I can't quite dance yet, I'm not quite ready to dance, we're going to the dance, that's it. Whatever makes her happy.",
        "Marina: I am so not happy right now.",
        "Marah: Because of the whole thing that happened last night with carrie?",
        "Marina: Oh, god. No, please. Don't even say that name to me. No, I'm focusing my energy on more superficial problems. Shayne is determined to take me to this valentine's day dance.",
        "Marah: Because he couldn't take you to the new year's eve dance.",
        "Marina: Yeah. I mean, I don't know if you've noticed this, but lately your brother has been getting these panicky, freak-out spells where I think he thinks he's going to lose all of his progress.",
        "Marah: Uh, yeah, I've noticed the whole snow-mobiling, family- bonding thing the other day.",
        "Marina: Yeah, what was that?",
        "Marah: I don't know, that's shayne. It seems like he's going into overdrive to prove that he's not falling back.",
        "Marina: Oh. He won't talk about it. Anyway, I think that's what this whole thing tonight is about, you know. It's him proving he can take me out dancing.",
        "Marah: I thought you liked to go out dancing, anyway?",
        "Marina: Yeah, I do, but, you know, not as much as everyone else thinks I do, and-- I don't know, honestly, if it were up to me, we'd skip the whole dance, and we'd just stay here by ourselves. Anyway, I guess it's too late now, huh?",
        "Marah: Maybe not.",
        "Announcer: This portion of guiding light is sponsored by pantene pro-V. That's the beauty of health. (Knocking)",
        "Marah: Hi, what are you doing here? You know what? Nevermind. I can use your help.",
        "Sandy: You... you've got glitter in your hair.",
        "Marah: Oh, thanks. So, can you stay?",
        "Sandy: I actually just came to return some cds I borrowed from shayne.",
        "Marah: Oh, cool, but uh, you can stay?",
        "Sandy: I don't know, marah. You haven't wanted me around much lately.",
        "Marah: I want you around when I need things done.",
        "Sandy: So, when there's furniture to be moved or fashion shows to be organized, then I'm your guy?",
        "Marah: Yeah! What are brothers for?",
        "Sandy: Ah. Well, the way you've been treating me lately, I would say for bashing. But, hey, that's okay, maybe i deserved some of it.",
        "Marah: Truce?",
        "Sandy: Is that an apology?",
        "Marah: That's all your getting.",
        "Sandy: Hmm. Good enough. What's the project, sis?",
        "Marah: I am planning a surprise valentine's date for marina and shayne.",
        "Sandy: Ah, and you don't think that they may have already gotten other plans?",
        "Marah: Well, they do have other plans. The surprise is that they're not keeping 'em.",
        "Sandy: Can I ask you a question?",
        "Marah: Yeah, what?",
        "Sandy: What you avoiding?",
        "Marah: What are you talking about?",
        "Sandy: Well, you're in turbo- marah mode, and whenever I've seen you like this you're usually doing it to avoid dealing with something else, usually, I don't know, guy- related?",
        "Marah: All right, you know what? Sandy, I am going to be straight with you because I don't want to spend all afternoon listening your psycho-babble.",
        "Sandy: Okay!",
        "Marah: I like someone. And I can't be with him. Do you follow?",
        "Sandy: Yeah.",
        "Marah: Right. So, because of that, I'm going to have a lousy valentine's day. And instead of walking around sulking, I am turning my negative romantic energy into positive romantic energy and planning a wonderful date for my brother and his girlfriend.",
        "Sandy: Mm, and when you're done creating that?",
        "Marah: Well, then I'll sulk.",
        "Sandy: More glitter, yeah.",
        "Marah: Oh. So, the way I see it, if you do want to be a part of this family, then you will help me plan this date for our brother.",
        "Sandy: Well, since you put it that way, sis, I am in!",
        "Marah: Yay!",
        "Sandy: Let's go!",
        "Marah: All right. Um, we need to cook some dinner for them, and marina absolutely loves chocolate cake, so i figured there would be some baking involved, too.",
        "Sandy: I have a better idea.",
        "Marah: Hm?",
        "Sandy: How about we order them takeout for dinner, I'll make a bakery run-- we'll be done!",
        "Marah: I don't think so. But you know what? If you can't stand the kitchen, then you can turn up the heat.",
        "Romantic heat: Candles, music--",
        "Sandy: I don't think I can.",
        "Marah: Of course you can. Just, you know, think of a muse. Think of, think of, what you want in a girl, and what she would want. So, have you thought about what you would want?",
        "Sandy: I, uh, I guess I would want a girl who really knew me. The real me. What would you look for in a guy?",
        "Marah: Ooh, scruffy beard and a law degree.",
        "Sandy: Mm. But generally speaking?",
        "Marah: Uh, I guess I would want somebody who... who gets me. Someone that I don't have to pretend with. (/Whispers:/) I'll be right back.",
        "Jeffrey: You're a hard man to get a hold of, doctor.",
        "Christopher: I go where I'm needed.",
        "Jeffrey: So, what'd you hear from reva?",
        "Christopher: I don't think that now is the time to involve her in this. She's dealing with too much in her own life and I don't think she needs any more from the people she's reading. I think we should make another attempt with her daughter.",
        "Jeffrey: No. No, reva's a pro. You know, marah'S... we don't need to back- pedal on this. Why are you dragging your heels, anyway? Has this developed into something personal with you and reva?",
        "Christopher: This may come as a surprise to you, jeffrey, but everything is personal.",
        "Carrie: Maryanne, maryanne. So pretty. So young. And so... alive. That song. Do you remember that song, josh? Well, of course you do. It was playing on the car radio that night. Well, I'm sure you remember it, billy, don't you? Oh, these. These, here, do you like them, buzz? You say they're not your type? Well, they were certainly maryanne's type. And she was your type, wasn't she? Oh very much your type. And alan. Oh, alan, we mustn't forget you. After all, you started it all, didn't you? Well, it's all going to be for you. It's all going to be for all of you.",
        "Danny: She's not breathing, bill. Michelle? Hey, michelle!",
        "Tony: Hey, I got your message.",
        "Danny: Thanks for coming by.",
        "Tony: Yeah, you bet. What's going on?",
        "Danny: Listen, the more i think about this gas leak at my house the other night, the more I'm convinced that salerno or bruzi had something to do with it.",
        "Tony: Let it... let it go, all right, danny? Let it go.",
        "Danny: I'm not going to let it go. Since when do you back off of something like this?",
        "Tony: Wait a second, I'm not backing off. I'm telling you to back off. Or did you forget about your campaign?",
        "Danny: Screw the race, tony. I want you to bring bruzi to me.",
        "Tony: It's a bad idea, danny.",
        "Danny: I need to know if he targeted my family and if he's trying to drag me into this war with salerno.",
        "Tony: Okay, then fine. Let me find out. That's what I'm here for.",
        "Danny: No, because I know bruzi, and I'll be able to tell if he's lying to me.",
        "Tony: I am telling you, leave it alone, all right?",
        "Danny: And I'm telling you, set up the meeting.",
        "Sandy: So, hey, marah. What picture am I looking am i looking for again?",
        "Marah: The prom picture. So, once you find it just put it in the card.",
        "Sandy: Roger that.",
        "Marah: Ta-da! What do you think?",
        "Sandy: Oh, wow. Impressive.",
        "Marah: Yeah, now all we have to do is decorate it.",
        "Sandy: Oh, that would be all you. I'm the candles and music guy, remember?",
        "Marah: But I think we'd get this done faster if we both do it. So, I need your help. Come on, it's flowers, hearts, valentine's day stuff. It's not that difficult.",
        "Sandy: Famous last words.",
        "Marah: Hey, no, no, no. None of that. All right? Don't make me do that again. Here.",
        "Sandy: Hm.",
        "Marah: Want you to do... that one.",
        "Sandy: Okay.",
        "Marah: All right here. Just finish this.",
        "Sandy: Uh...",
        "Marah: All right? Do it smoothly and evenly. You can't mess it up.",
        "Sandy: Okay, smooth.",
        "Marah: More smoothly and evenly. (Laughs)",
        "Sandy: (Laughs) okay, okay.",
        "Marah: Flatten it out.",
        "Sandy: Mm.",
        "Marah: Flatten it out a little bit.",
        "Sandy: Like, like, okay...",
        "Marah: And grab me that one; we'll put it on top.",
        "Sandy: Mm-hmm.",
        "Marah: Okay. Okay. (Laughs)",
        "Sandy: Like, like that?",
        "Marah: Put it on top. No, no! All right. Here. There. Like that.",
        "Sandy: Bam!",
        "Marah: No. More.",
        "Sandy: Okay.",
        "Marah: More. Try it.",
        "Sandy: Okay, like this.",
        "Marah: Good, quick, quick.",
        "Sandy: Quick, all right! Like this.",
        "Marah: Uh, prettier. You need it prettier. (Laughs)",
        "Sandy: Uh, you know, I don't think this is my thing.",
        "Marah: All right, you know, when shayne and I were little, he would help me and we would bake cakes together, and he was really good at decorating.",
        "Sandy: And your point is?",
        "Marah: My point is that it must not run in the family.",
        "Sandy: Ah, okay. Well, give me this. Let me try this.",
        "Marah: Okay, with that, you need to keep the flowers one inch apart.",
        "Sandy: Flowers, like that!",
        "Marah: No, no! (Laughs)",
        "Sandy: How about this?",
        "Marah: No, no, no!",
        "Sandy: Okay, what about...",
        "Marah: Stop! (Laughs) like this.",
        "Sandy: Yeah, okay, this is officially torture.",
        "Marah: I didn't tell you that this was going to be fun.",
        "Sandy: You know what would be fun?",
        "Marah: What? (Screams) (laughs)",
        "Sandy: I bet shayne never started icing fights.",
        "Marah: Yeah, yeah he did. But you know what? I always finished! (Laughs)",
        "Sandy: Oh, oh! Oh, oh! Oh, oh! Hey, hey, hey! You okay?",
        "Marah: Yes. Oh, my gosh.",
        "Sandy: Because you got icing all over...",
        "Marah: All right, stop, stop, stop, stop! (Laughs) let's get cleaned up, okay? (Laughs)",

        "Marina: Oh, gosh, shayne, that's what I want. That's what I want to do. I just want to stay home with you. Okay, you know what? Forget it. I'm sorry, you're disappointed. I'm so sorry.",
        "Shayne: No. No, no, no, no, no. I... I don't want to go to the dance. I want the same thing you do. I want to stay home with you, just the two of us alone. That's what I want.",

        "Blade: Oh, you do.",
        "Danny: That's great, guys. Right there. That's good, thank you. Hey.",
        "Tony: You want to be a walking bull's eye for these guys, danny?",
        "Danny: I don't know what you're getting so upset about. I asked you to set up a meeting. Set up the meeting.",
        "Tony: All it's going to do is make you a target for them. You're good at pushing their buttons, danny.",
        "Danny: I'm not pushing anybody's buttons, tony. I'm living my life.",
        "Tony: You're not living your life, man. You're throwing it in everybody's face.",
        "Danny: Really?",
        "Tony: Yeah, it started with 5th street. Cleaning up the mob territory. Now you're running for mayor. Cleaning up the whole town. When is this going to end, you know?",
        "Danny: Why should it end?",
        "Tony: You know something, the hell with it. I'm serious. No, actually, one other thing. You can't run from your past.",
        "Danny: You don't know what you're talking about.",
        "Tony: Really? I don't?",
        "Danny: No.",
        "Tony: I know one thing: The families are going to turn on you, and you know that. You think that bruzi and salerno are sending you a message. Huh? Do you?",
        "Danny: Yeah.",
        "Tony: Well, I think they are, too, danny. They want to know what the hell you're up to. And quite frankly, so do I. Light rail series.End on series.End on",
        "Danny: You know exactly what I'm doing. And I thought you wanted it for me, too.",
        "Tony: All I am saying... all right, listen, danny. All I'm saying is that if you're interested in protecting your family, keep yourself out of the headline. That's all.",
        "Danny: Well, that's a little hard to do, now that I'm running for mayor, don't you think? See, you were never, never behind this campaign.",
        "Tony: But I've always been behind you, danny.",
        "Danny: (/Scoffs/) yeah.",
        "Tony: What do you mean? What? What?",
        "Danny: Why are you here, tony?",
        "Tony: (Laughs) you called me, so I came down.",
        "Danny: No, why are you here? In springfield? Why? I never understood why you came back. Frankly, I sure as hell don't understand why you're still sticking around.",
        "Tony: Interesting. What, you're complaining now? Is that it? Huh?",
        "Danny: No, I want the truth.",
        "Tony: You want the truth?",
        "Danny: Yeah.",
        "Tony: Truth is, I came back here to make peace with my past, which is something that you should do, danny.",
        "Danny: Right.",
        "Tony: We all should do it in order to move on.",
        "Danny: Yeah, I know. And that's exactly what I'm doing...",
        "Tony: Really?",
        "Danny: ...And this is how i choose to do it.",
        "Tony: The families aren't going to let you do it this way, danny. Look at me! The higher you climb, the bigger the fall, you know? It's not too late to get out. Please.",
        "Danny: I'm not getting out.",
        "Tony: Danny, please!",
        "Danny: Just get-- bring bruzi to me. All right? Can you handle it? I'll take care of the rest.",

        "Marah: Thanks.",
        "Sandy: The place is beyond romantic.",
        "Marah: Thank you. And thank you for helping. Marina and shayne deserve something nice. And it was a good distraction for me, too.",
        "Sandy: From what?",
        "Marah: Oh, the chaos that is my life.",
        "Sandy: Jeffrey o'neill?",
        "Marah: Believe it or not, i do think about other things other than jeffrey o'neill.",
        "Sandy: But you do... think about him?",
        "Marah: Sandy, do you know what? We've been through this. And I don't really feel like a lecture right now, please.",
        "Sandy: Who's lecturing? I'm thinking if you can't get him out of your head, maybe you should go for it.",
        "Marah: What are you talking about? I thought you hated that I want to be with jeffrey?",
        "Sandy: Yeah. But who am I to tell you what to do? Life is nothing but a series of choices. You make them, you live with them, and that's all you really have.",
        "Marah: Are you taking philosophy this semester?",
        "Sandy: All I'm saying is, I've made my choices, you should be free to make yours.",
        "Marah: Really? What choices have you been making lately?",
        "Sandy: We're not talking about me.",
        "Marah: Look, sandy, even if i chose jeffrey, he would still have to choose me. And I don't know that he would. Our lives are very different, and I don't know if I would fit into his. You know, you can't always have what you want.",
        "Sandy: Well, hey, anything's possible.",
        "Marah: What is it with you today? You're, like, supportive.",
        "Sandy: Yeah, it's called being a good brother.",

        "Marah: Bye.",
        "Shayne: They are all yours.",
        "Nico: No way. Not again. The last time you gave me tickets, they came with string attached. I had to take marina, but i couldn't tell marina. She didn't want to go with me; you made her go with me. Look, it's too much stress, all right? Please, keep your tickets.",
        "Marina: But we're not going to the dance, nico. We changed our plans.",
        "Shayne: No, but seriously. They're all yours, and you can take whoever you want. No strings attached.",
        "Nico: No. I still don't want these things.",
        "Shayne: Dude, what are-- two free tickets. Two free tickets. Why wouldn't you want to take these? Dude, don't make me say it.",

        "Lizzie: Are you guys?",
        "Shayne: No.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, I guess that's probably a good call. It's going to be lame, anyways. But I better get back to my warden. See you guys later.",
        "Nico: Later.",
        "Beth: Hey, so our order should be ready in a minute.",
        "Lizzie: Okay.",
        "Beth: Where are you going?",
        "Lizzie: I'll meet you out at the car. Did you follow me?",
        "Blade: I wasn't sure if you were going to show up tonight. I mean, I wouldn't think a girl like you would be into my scene.",
        "Lizzie: Then obviously you've never met a girl like me.",
        "Tony: Hey, bruzi, listen to me. You stay where you are, okay? I'll be right there. No, stay there. I'll be right there.",
        "Tony: Hey, how are you doing?",

        "Tony: No, no, no, please, what?",
        "Michelle: Well, ever since the gas leak, he's just been a little edgy, you know, and hovering over me, and worrying.",
        "Tony: He'S... he'S... he'S... trying to protect you, michelle, okay?",
        "Michelle: No, I know. I know, don't get me wrong. I appreciate it. It's just that he's got a lot on his plate and I hate to see him worrying about something that's not that big of a deal, you know. It was probably an accident, right?",
        "Tony: I know my cousin better than anyone, all right? Okay?",
        "Michelle: Better than anyone?",
        "Tony: Oh, yeah, well maybe a little more than you, I guess.",
        "Michelle: Yeah, well.",
        "Tony: Listen, listen, michelle, I know that I don't always agree with what danny does. You know that, right? But I can't fault him for how much he cares about you and robbie and loves you. He's trying to take care of you. He wants to protect you, okay?",
        "Michelle: Well, I want to protect him, too, you know, and I guess I just haven't been doing that good of a job lately, and I... I don't know. Could you just talk to him? Try to calm him down a little bit?",
        "Tony: I'm not so sure about that. I'm pretty good at riling him up lately. We're not talking, so...",
        "Michelle: Well, just try, because he listens to you.",
        "Tony: I'll see.",
        "Marina: Ah, beth! Beth, hey you forgot your coffee-- oh, hey!",

        "Frank: Oh, you're a little late. They just took off, but is that coffee?",
        "Marina: Uh, yeah, actually.",
        "Frank: Oh, thank god. Listen, I'm glad I ran into you, though. I'd like you to reserve a space for your old man on your dance card.",
        "Marina: My what?",
        "Frank: Save a couple of spaces for me? Some dances?",
        "Marina: What?",
        "Frank: Hello! The country club, valentine's day.",
        "Marina: Oh, yeah. Uh, actually, we're not going to go.",
        "Frank: What? What are you talking about? I thought this was a big celebration for you and shayne now that he's back on his feet and everything.",
        "Marina: I know, I know. It was just kind of too much, too soon. You know, I think we're going to keep it low key this year. But you're not going to miss me. You have your own valentine. Darci.",
        "Frank: Yeah, well, you'll always be my number one valentine. I've got to go. Do me a favor. Say hi to shayne, okay?",

        "Marah: Why not?",
        "Jeffrey: You're so beautiful. And you're all I ever think about. I can't get any work done at the office. I haven't slept in days. You're everywhere.",
        "Marah: No, I've been here the whole time waiting for you.",
        "Jeffrey: You know, all this time I've been fighting my feelings. Fighting my feelings for you. You know, I can put up a hell of a fight.",

        "Jeffrey: But I'm through fighting. I'm here now, and all I want is to be with you.",
        "Marah: That's all that i want.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, this has, you know, created quite an identity crisis for me.",
        "Marah: How?",
        "Jeffrey: How? Well, I'm a loner, you know? I've worked very hard to stay that way. And now, I'M... I'm not alone anymore. Everything changed one night when a beautiful, amazing young woman got into my car for a ride home. She's made me happier than I've ever been.",
        "Marah: I was so scared that it was just me who felt this way.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, you know, it took me a little longer to get there, but I finally go there, and it was well worth the trip.",
        "Marah: Just promise me that you won't leave.",
        "Jeffrey: Not a chance.",
        "Marah: You're still here. Dreams really do come true. There's just one thing missing.",
        "Jeffrey: I love you, marah.",
        "Marah: Yeah, that was it.",
        "Singer: Who are we to question this fire inside the kiss that keeps us warm, drawn to each other. We are only who our hearts allow. We're strangers in a crowd, but we're together. Love, only love can make the wind caress the sea the lonely soul, young and free. Sweet, bitter tears of passion rolling down my cheek. Everyone needs only love. A reflection in the clouds a moment that could pass without a trace. It goes around us we are winds without the slightest breeze rising high above the trees because we are made of love only love can make the wind caress the sea. The lonely soul young and free sweet, bitter tears of passion rolling down my cheek everyone needs only love only love. Next, on \"guiding light...\" Tony wants to be friends. And the weird thing is, it could be okay. Oh, good, he can be a date for you for tonight. This valentine that met you to the valentine dance at the country club, table five. Be mine and be there."
