        "Cassie agrees to join Reva and Christopher to verify if she has psychic powers. Jeffrey's unexpected presence presents a challenge but Cassie plunges into the experiment. Cassie proves not to have the power but Marah arrives to be tested. For her, Jeffrey's presence is more than a challenge; it's a visceral reminder of the feelings she has for him. By the end of the experiment, her psychic skills remain unresolved. Josh, Billy and Buzz plan to go into the tunnel to find the person they believe to be using and threatening their daughters and granddaughter. Buzz, off his earlier conversation with Alan, has not come empty-handed but has brought along a weapon for self- protection. At the same time, Marina gets a call from Carrie summoning her to her room and giving her directions through the same maze of tunnels. Without realizing they are on separate paths, Marina makes her way towards Carrie's while the three men search the tunnel. The walls being to crumble, and Marina suspects that Carrie has lured her underground to trap her. The walls then collapse and Marina is trapped beneath the debris. At the Spaulding board meeting, Olivia has arrived armed with Phillip's proxy and power of attorney. At first, Alan and Alex try to block her attempt to take Phillip's seat on the board."

    "Transcript": [
        "Alan: I propose that Gus assume Phillip's place on the board until Phillip returns.",
        "Olivia: Won't be necessary, Alan. Hello, everyone. Now that I'm a Spaulding and Phillip's wife, I'm sure you'll agree the best person to represent his interests is me.",
        "Alan: Well, Olivia, what a surprise.",
        "Olivia: Please, Alan, don't get up. Hello, Jason, Glenn, Brad, nice to see you again.",
        "Brad: Olivia, it's been a quite a while.",
        "Olivia: It was almost much longer. Please, sit down, gentlemen. Alan, you forgot to e-mail me what time the meeting was, but I'm sure it was just an oversight. I hope I didn't miss too much.",
        "Gus: Olivia, does Phillip even know that you're here?",
        "Olivia: Of course, he asked me to come. In fact, now that I'm Phillip's wife, he's counting on me to speak on his behalf if there are any decisions to be made. So, this is where he usually sits, isn't it?",
        "Cassie: You know, I don't... I'm feeling weird.",
        "Reva: Well, that's very promising for a potential medium.",
        "Cassie: I don't want to do this, Reva.",
        "Reva: Oh, come on, Cassie. Christopher is very professional, especially when it comes to dealing with his subjects, whether they have the gift or not. Besides, it will be fun -- especially if we wind up being psychic sisters.",
        "Cassie: I haven't seen this gift being too fun for you. You just want someone to be miserable with.",
        "Reva: Hello? Hello? Hello? I don't know where he is.",
        "Marina: Hang on, like, two seconds and then I will be done with my shift and then I am all yours.",
        "Shayne: Okay.",
        "Marina: Hello?",
        "Shayne: Who's that?",
        "Marina: Hey, look, whatever this is, you just need to forget it because I have not had alone time with my boyfriend in weeks and I'm going to now. No. No, I said... I said... okay. Okay. Fine. God, if it's that important. What? Why can't I just get in my car and then come... fine. Fine. All right. Go ahead. Okay. Through the main tunnel at Company to the crack in the wall. You get to crawl through it? Oh, yeah, only like 100 meters or so. Okay. Right at the fork, straight until I get to your room.",
        "Shayne: What are you doing?",
        "Alan: Just do what you have to do. You're the only one with the experience to do what needs to be done.",
        "Buzz: This is different. This is different. ( Gasps)",
        "Harley: Gotcha. You sure are a tough guy to find.",
        "Buzz: Well, here I am.",
        "Harley: You know what, Dad? I think you and I need to have some fun.",
        "Buzz: Fun? What's that?",
        "Harley: See? That's how long it's been since we hung out together. You don't even remember.",
        "Buzz: I'm a little busy right now.",
        "Harley: You're busy, huh? Sitting here, drinking alone? Daddy, I know that you have a lot of stuff on your mind, but, see, there it is. That's the look I'm concerned about, that weight-of-the-world look. Tell me you couldn't use some... I don't know, some quality father/daughter time.",
        "Buzz: Where's daughter's fianc\u00e9e?",
        "Harley: Daughter's fianc\u00e9e is at a Spaulding Board meeting which could go late. So I'm free.",
        "Buzz: You know, it's good that Gus is looking out for you and the grandkids, you know, if something happened.",
        "Harley: If what happens?",
        "Josh: Buzz, what are you doing? We're waiting for you outside. It's a big poker night tonight.",
        "Harley: Poker?",
        "Josh: Yes.",
        "Harley: Whoo, I'm in.",
        "Billy: No, no, no. You can't, maybe next time.",
        "Buzz: We're booked solid.",
        "Billy: If you don't get a move on, we're not going to get in on the action, so let's go, saddle up. Nice seeing you, Harley.",
        "Buzz: Rain check on the fun.",
        "Harley: Sure. Have fun. What's in the bag, chips?",
        "Marina: Oh, God, I hate it when people give me takeout orders when, I'm, like, two seconds away from finishing my shift.",
        "Shayne: Wait. Why would you be taking a takeout order on your cell phone? That's your line, that's not Company's.",
        "Marina: Oh, it's this stupid thing that these guys at school do. They think it's really funny to call my personal line and place delivery orders. Ever wonder where the term \"sophomoric\" comes from?",
        "Shayne: Sophomores, I guess.",
        "Marina: Hey, would you mind instead of us hanging out right now, if we did it later on tonight at the Museum?",
        "Shayne: Oh, but I thought you couldn't wait to hang out.",
        "Marina: I can't. It's just... I don't know. I'm... I'm really worried about Michelle, you know, I mean that thing the other night really freaked her out.",
        "Shayne: Yeah. Yeah, I heard about that where she had a gas leak or something, right?",
        "Marina: Yeah, and I really feel like I need to go by and check on her.",
        "Shayne: Okay, well, you know what? It's cool. I'll go with you.",
        "Marina: No. I just already made semi-plans to do it with Marah.",
        "Shayne: As in \"No Boys Allowed\"?",
        "Marina: I'll make it up to you, I promise.",
        "Shayne: You better. Soup only goes so far. Here, I'll walk you out.",
        "Marina: Oh, that's okay. I'm going to do this takeout order. See you later.",
        "Alexandra: Olivia, you may have a seat at this table, but you do not have a vote on this board.",
        "Olivia: Oh, I know, Alexandra, but Phillip does. That's why I brought these. It's his signed proxy and power of attorney. You see, when I said that I was speaking for Phillip, I meant in the legal, formal sense. Feel free.",
        "Beth: With all due respect, Olivia, how do we know that these genuinely represent Phillip's wishes?",
        "Olivia: You're sounding pretty formal yourself, Beth.",
        "Alan: I think that's a legitimate question, Olivia.",
        "Olivia: The implication being that Phillip is incapable of making a rational decision. Well, if that's the case, then we would have to disregard everything that Phillip has put his name to recently. Not just those, but this as well.",
        "Alan: Well, Olivia is quite right. The last time I saw Phillip, he was very lucid and capable of making his own decisions.",
        "Olivia: Does that answer your question?",
        "Beth: I suppose.",
        "Alan: So if Phillip wants his wife to represent him on the board, I think we should honor his wishes.",
        "Olivia: Thank you, Alan. Well, now that that's settled. Gus, I guess you can leave. I mean, you really don't need to be here to take up the slack for Phillip. You can go back to your first love: Police work.",
        "Gus: Actually, I think I am going to just stick around Spaulding for a while, you know? Maybe sure there's no slack. After all, Phillip was one of the people that asked me to come on board and, like you said, the man knows what he wants, right?",
        "Cassie: I didn't know this was open to the public.",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, I'm not the public, Mrs. Winslow, and I'm not going to invade anyone's privacy, I can sure a assure you.",
        "Reva: And you're here because?",
        "Jeffrey: Because I was invited by the doctor here. I'm just going to be an observer, that's all.",
        "Reva: You asked him to come?",
        "Christopher: Jeffrey's hardly been a negative presence. He's long been a supporter of my research.",
        "Jeffrey: We go way back.",
        "Christopher: Reva, you already used your imaging ability to help Jeffrey with the Springfield PD. Any problem there?",
        "Reva: No, no. He's always been very supportive of what I do. Well, he has.",
        "Jeffrey: Why don't we just try to put our personal issues aside, Mrs. Winslow, just for the sake of the experience experiment. What do you say?",
        "Cassie: I'll act like you're not here. How's that?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, whatever works for you.",
        "Christopher: Are we agreed?",
        "Cassie: Agreed...",
        "Christopher: Good. Then I'll just bring the sitter in and we'll get started.",
        "Jeffrey: And I'll just practice acting not here. Reva:(Laughs) I would understand if you don't want to do this in front of Jeffrey.",
        "Cassie: No, it's fine. You know, he's here. And what do I care if I do in front of Jeffrey. He thinks I'm nuts anyway.",
        "Reva: And vice versa.",
        "Cassie: That's true.",
        "Marah: Hey, am I too late?",
        "Reva: What are you doing here? You said you weren't...",
        "Marah: Interested in being a psychic guinea pig. I know I said that. But then I thought about why.",
        "Cassie: Well...",
        "Marah: I said \u0091no' so fast, so automatically, and what was that about?",
        "Reva: Well, honey, you don't have to do this.",
        "Marah: Wait, let me finish. I was just thinking if your gift does run in the family, then why not see if I have it and let me let a professional tell me if it's anything special. Hi, Jeffrey.",
        "Jeffrey: Hi.",
        "Christopher: Oh, another observer?",
        "Reva: No, actually, a participant. Marah's decided that she wants to be a part of the experiment. Unless, of course, it's too late for that.",
        "Marah: Is it okay, Dr. Langham?",
        "Cassie: You know, I'm sure she wouldn't mind if you said \u0091no,' though, since it's such last minute.",
        "Christopher: Marah, I'd be delighted if you would take part. We're trying to determine if your mother's gift runs in the family, so it makes perfect sense for you to test, too.",
        "Marah: So, when do we start?",
        "Christopher: Right now. Let me explain how this works. Someone is sitting on the other side of this screen.",
        "Cassie: A stranger.",
        "Christopher: Yes. I'm going to ask each of you in turn to read the sitter and he or she is going to give you only one word answers.",
        "Marah: By \"read,\" do you mean tell you what we're feeling about them?",
        "Christopher: What you're feeling, what you're sensing. I'm interested in any and all impressions, so don't hold back.",
        "Reva: Careful what you ask us to do.",
        "Christopher: And don't filter your responses, either. Even if they seem silly or embarrassing.",
        "Cassie: Embarrassing. That'll be me.",
        "Christopher: Don't pre-judge yourself, Cassie. This work demands an open mind, so any questions? Okay. Good. Let's get started.",
        "Cassie: Well, you're not going to put electrodes on my head or anything, are you?",
        "Christopher: Just focus, Cassie. Try to concentrate on the sitter. Any impressions?",
        "Cassie: I don't know. Wait a minute. There's something.",
        "Christopher: What?",
        "Cassie: It's a sound. It is. It's almost... it's like squeaky shoes.",
        "Christopher: That would be me.",
        "Cassie: Oh. I don't know what I'm doing. I'm sorry.",
        "Christopher: It's all right, Cassie. Let's try again. Now this time try to focus your energies on the sitter. See if you can pick up only what's coming from the sitter.",
        "Cassie: All right. The only thing I'm getting is that I have zero talent for this.",
        "Marina: Okay. Where's this stupid crack in the wall where the alternate route begins? It couldn't be creepier in here. You have got to be kidding me. You owe me big time, Carrie.",
        "Olivia: Look, I'm the last person to question Phillip's wishes. After all, he did marry me, so... (Laughs)",
        "Gus: So you don't have any problem with me sticking around, is that right?",
        "Olivia: Gus, if Phillip wants you at Spaulding, I want that, too.",
        "Alan: My, my, Olivia, you've become quite the team player, haven't you?",
        "Olivia: Well, I've taken a vow to be one. And besides, this is a family business and we're all family.",
        "Gus: Well, we're not all family.",
        "Brad: Not everyone's blessed with the good fortune of being born Alan Spaulding's son, Gus. I earned my seat on the board.",
        "Alan: Brad, Gus may be a Spaulding, but he has worked very hard for the company.",
        "Alexandra: That's very true.",
        "Alan: And I think after today and what he's done in the past few months, he has proven to be a top-flight young executive who is intelligent, forward- thinking, and, above all, loyal.",
        "Olivia: Well, in other words, Gus would be wonderful to have on the board, you know, if there was a seat available. But, unfortunately, there isn't.",
        "Alan: Well, that matter has not been settled yet, Olivia.",
        "Olivia: Alan, you still want Gus to take Phillip's seat, even now after I've shown you his proxy and power of attorney?",
        "Alan: It wouldn't be permanent, Olivia. Only until Phillip recovers and reclaims his seat on the board.",
        "Olivia: Well, I thought I made it clear that, until then, I will take his seat.",
        "Alan: But I am sure you'll want to spend some time with your new husband until he feels better.",
        "Olivia: I can do both. I will do both.",
        "Alan: That won't be necessary.",
        "Olivia: Maybe we should take a vote on it.",
        "Brad: Let's have a show of hands.",
        "Beth: Alan.",
        "Alan: Not now.",
        "Beth: Will you listen to me? I've got a fistful of proxies from Mindy and all of the rest of them and every one was given to me in support of Phillip. If you let this vote go through, I'll have to side with Olivia. Do not make me do that.",
        "Olivia: Alexandra, you've been very quiet. How do you feel about all this?",
        "Alexandra: What? I'm afraid I have to agree with Alan. I think that Gus should take Phillip's seat until Phillip's well enough to return.",
        "Brad: Let's call the roll.",
        "Alan: That won't be necessary. Perhaps we can deal with this issue at the next meeting. But for now, in the spirit of family unity, I think we should leave things as they are.",
        "Olivia: Thank you very much, Alan. No hard feelings, I hope.",
        "Gus: You said it, we're all family, right?",
        "Josh: Did you hear that?",
        "Billy: Sounds more like balsa wood than stone.",
        "Buzz: Where exactly are we?",
        "Josh: That's a good question. Let me see those blueprints. Hey, don't be leaning up against that wall, okay? I don't trust it in here. We came in right here.",
        "Buzz: Wait a second, guys.",
        "Josh: What's the problem?",
        "Billy: It branches off in three different directions.",
        "Josh: It's not on the blueprint here.",
        "Billy: This is more like a maize than a map. Hey, hey. As soon as we get through this and get out of here, the better. As soon as we find what we're looking for.",
        "Josh: We know what we're looking for.",
        "Buzz: There's a million places down here they could hide or ambush us from.",
        "Billy: It's a good thing that Alan and Ed didn't come.",
        "Josh: Yeah. Ed's about to lose it entirely and Alan is...",
        "Billy: Alan's just Alan.",
        "Buzz: Say what you want about Alan, sometimes he has the right idea.",
        "Josh: What is that supposed to mean?",
        "Buzz: Let's keep moving.",
        "Josh: Wait a second. Wait a second. What's in the backpack?",
        "Buzz: Nothing.",
        "Josh: You've been holding on to that thing pretty tight, so I'm curious what's it in it.",
        "Buzz: Just supplies.",
        "Josh: What kind of supplies?",
        "Buzz: I'll make you a list when we get back.",
        "Josh: What the hell is that? What are you doing with that?",
        "Billy: That's a service revolver.",
        "Buzz: Whoever we're looking for knows we're looking for him. I wasn't going to come down here unarmed.",
        "Josh: Put the gun away.",
        "Buzz: Forget it.",
        "Billy: It's no time to play cowboy, Buzz.",
        "Buzz: It's no time to play stupid.",
        "Josh: Put the gun back in the backpack.",
        "Buzz: No, I'm not going to shoot anybody. I'm not going to shoot.",
        "Josh: If you fire that thing down here, you could bring the whole place down on top of us. Put it away!",
        "Buzz: They might have a weapon.",
        "Josh: I don't care!",
        "Billy: There's three of us here. He's stupid to pull anything.",
        "Buzz: Look at the things he's pulled far, my God, with Marah, with Michelle.",
        "Josh: Here's the deal. You leave that thing here or we're out of here. Your choice. We can leave it here as a marker so we'll know that we came this way and we can pick it up when we come back.",
        "Buzz: Fine!",
        "Marina: (Gasps) (Coughing) What is going on? Hello? Hello, is somebody there?",
        "Billy: Shh.",
        "Josh: What was that?",
        "Buzz: What?",
        "Josh: Did you hear that?",
        "Billy: Holy smokes, what the hell?",
        "Josh: I didn't even know what that was.",
        "Buzz: Probably our friend wheeling up with a Howitzer.",
        "Josh: That's really funny, Buzz. I can't believe you thought it was a good idea to bring a gun down here.",
        "Buzz: I still do, it's for self-defense. What if we find this guy and he gets nasty on us? What are you going to fight with a well-armed...",
        "Josh: Wait a minute.",
        "Buzz: What?",
        "Josh: When we decided to do this the other night, you went outside with Alan for a couple minutes.",
        "Billy: Yeah, yeah. I wondered about that, too.",
        "Josh: Is that when he talked you into doing this? To bringing a gun in here, what? So you can take out this witness when we find him?",
        "Buzz: You're nuts.",
        "Josh: That's what got us into trouble in the first place, Buzz, listening to Alan Spaulding.",
        "Buzz: Nobody pushes me around, not you, not Alan.",
        "Billy: Guys, stop it! Stop it! We've got work to do. This might be getting dangerous, so let's... let's do it. You ready? Are you ready?",
        "Buzz: Oh, I'm ready.",
        "Billy: Okay. Three tunnels, we each take one, we meet back here ten minutes, anybody gets in trouble or you see anything, holler. Just follow me.",
        "Marina: Marah? Michelle? Is that you? Okay. Okay, okay. Don't stop here, you have to keep going. You have to get to Carrie's room. You have to...",
        "Reva: There's a man about thirty... no.",
        "Christopher: No? The sitter's not a man?",
        "Reva: No. There are two men. Two men exactly same. Are you a twin?",
        "Sitter: Yes.",
        "Marah: I'm still not sure what I'm supposed to be feeling.",
        "Christopher: Well, there isn't really a \"supposed to,\" Marah. Whatever comes up, comes up.",
        "Marah: So I just wait until something does?",
        "Christopher: Basically, yes. Just relax, try to get rid of your expectations, and allow yourself whatever images or sensations may come. What is it? What are you seeing?",
        "Marah: A man.",
        "Christopher: Tell me about him?",
        "Marah: He's lonely and he doesn't like to admit it, but there is an emptiness in his life that he can't seem to fill.",
        "Sitter: Yes.",
        "Cassie: Okay. Is it a he? Or, is it a she? I... I don't know. Well, I told you, I'm no good at this, okay? I'm just no good at this.",
        "Christopher: Give yourself a chance, Cassie.",
        "Cassie: Okay. Well, what am I supposed to be feeling? Am I supposed to be feeling what he's feeling? Is it a he?",
        "Christopher: Whatever impressions you get.",
        "Cassie: That's no help. Okay. Hunger.",
        "Christopher: Excuse me?",
        "Cassie: Well, I'm feeling... I mean, I'm sensing hunger.",
        "Sitter: No.",
        "Jeffrey: I could eat.",
        "Reva: The man is walking in a very dark place. Do you explore caves?",
        "Sitter: No.",
        "Reva: Your brother, then, could this be about him?",
        "Sitter: Yes.",
        "Reva: He's still walking, only now the passageway is getting very thin, like the walls are pressing in, closer, tighter. Can't... can't breathe, there's someone dying. Someone's dying.",
        "Christopher: It's all right, Reva.",
        "Reva: (Gasping) No. I need air.",
        "Christopher: You're just receiving some strong input, but you near no danger yourself. Just breathe, breathe. One more time. That's it.",
        "Reva: Thank you.",
        "Christopher: Better?",
        "Reva: It was so powerful, so real.",
        "Sitter: That was unbelievable.",
        "Reva: Your brother passed away, didn't he?",
        "Sitter: Emphysema.",
        "Reva: He was having more and more trouble breathing until... I'm sorry.",
        "Christopher: I think that's all we'll do for today. I appreciate your coming.",
        "Marah: Hey, is it my turn again?",
        "Jeffrey: No, they're still wrapping up.",
        "Marah: Well, that's just as well, I was a total bust.",
        "Jeffrey: Don't say that.",
        "Marah: It's true. I kept trying to concentrate and open my mind, but something kept getting in the way.",
        "Brad: Congratulations, Olivia.",
        "Olivia: Thank you, Brad.",
        "Brad: Who says change can't be beautiful?",
        "Olivia: Did you think up that line by yourself?",
        "Brad: I look forward to working closely with you. I have one of those, too. See how much we have in common? My door is always open.",
        "Olivia: The one to your office or the one to your condo in Vail?",
        "Brad: I love a woman who does her homework.",
        "Olivia: Beth, you know, I thought I made it clear the other night that I do love Phillip. That's actually why I'm here. It proves it. I have his best interest at heart.",
        "Beth: Oh, it proves something all right. But love has nothing to do with it.",
        "Olivia: You couldn't be more wrong. I must say, it is so gratifying to know that I'm a part of a family that pulls together in time of crisis.",
        "Alexandra: Well, you know, Olivia, if there's a crisis, it's you who caused it.",
        "Alan: You may wear Phillip's wedding ring, but you will never be family, Olivia.",
        "Olivia: Well, wasn't I family when I was wearing your ring, Alan?",
        "Alan: Why don't we all take a ride over to Ravenwood and ask Phillip how he feels about you taking his seat on the board?",
        "Olivia: Well, if that will ease your mind, why don't you start up the car? But I must say there's one little problem because Phillip has left strict instructions by the staff that he doesn't want to be disturbed by his auntie and his father.",
        "Alexandra: And how very convenient.",
        "Gus: Timely.",
        "Olivia: Well, you know what? It's not going to be forever. He just needs a little distance from you for his recovery's sake.",
        "Alexandra: Somehow I think that you may be keeping him in that hospital.",
        "Olivia: This is funny coming from the woman who drugged her brother into near catatonia. Remember that?",
        "Alexandra: Then, of all things, I should know exactly what I'm talking about, shouldn't I?",
        "Alan: You are the main reason that Phillip is in that sanitarium in the first place.",
        "Olivia: Oh, this is so familiar, you know, being branded as the outsider with an agenda, again. Speaking of which, Gus, you're the new Spaulding who wants so badly to be on the board. What's your agenda?",
        "Marina: Oh, my God. Okay, that is the same rock. I just went around in a big circle. Thanks for the great directions, Carrie. Geez, if I didn't know any better, I'd think that you were trying to... you wanted me to get lost down here.",
        "Josh: We came down right there and... Did you see anything?",
        "Buzz: It's a dead end.",
        "Billy: We didn't come up with anything, either.",
        "Buzz: It's bad.",
        "Billy: No, we're down here, let's give it another hour or two.",
        "Josh: Wait a second. Wait a second. Did you feel that?",
        "Billy: Whoa!",
        "Marina: Okay, that's it, I'm out of here! ( Screams)",
        "Harley: Hey... yo. So much for your first board meeting, huh?",
        "Gus: It was a bloodbath.",
        "Harley: That bad?",
        "Gus: I'm surprised people didn't leave with their own personal stretchers.",
        "Harley: Well, you know, hon, there's that Spaulding truism that if you get more than one of them in a room together, somebody's going to suffer.",
        "Gus: Let's just hope it's not Phillip suffering more than he already has.",
        "Harley: Why? Was Phillip even there?",
        "Gus: No. Well, yes, by proxy. His charming wife strutted in and she was armed with a briefcase full of legal work.",
        "Harley: Really? What did Olivia want?",
        "Gus: Probably to take over the entire company. I really couldn't tell you. But I'll tell you something, in one fell swoop she managed to block Alan's bid to put me on the board and she injected herself right into Phillip's seat.",
        "Harley: All by herself. Impressive.",
        "Gus: No, actually. I think she's got Brad Green on her side.",
        "Harley: Really? Why do you say that that?",
        "Gus: That guy was way too eager to back her up.",
        "Harley: Why would he do that? I mean, Olivia... Well, Alexandra and Brad are pretty close, and Alexandra hates Olivia, so...",
        "Gus: No, no. I think it's because of me. See, earlier I practically accused him of not being on the up and up with Spaulding Pharmaceuticals and I did in the front of the whole board.",
        "Harley: So Olivia's not the only Spaulding stirring things up.",
        "Gus: That guy, that guy is up to something, I know it.",
        "Harley: What? What do you think he could be up to?",
        "Gus: I don't really know, but I tell you, I'm going to get the bottom of it. And Big Al, he's on his way over here. We're going to have a whole post-mortem on the board, and maybe he can shed some light on this guy.",
        "Harley: Well, then, I should go so that you guys can talk business, which you can't do in front of a civilian anyway. So I'll just see you later at home tonight.",
        "Gus: See you.",
        "Harley: Okay. Bye.",
        "(Door Closes)",
        "Harley: Brad Green. No, Brad Green's voice mail. Brad Green, this is Harley Cooper. I was thinking about you today and I was thinking that it's been quite a while since we saw each other, so why don't you... why don't you meet me at the Beacon later tonight? I'll make it worth your while.",
        "Olivia: Hello, my sweet girl. Look at how wide awake you are. Hey, guess what? Guess where Mommy was today? I was at a big, big meeting that went very, very well. Yes, it did. You see how happy Mommy is? That's because I'm taking care of you and it feels so good, baby. You know, when Mommy was little, she didn't have anyone to fight for her. But your life's going to be different now, because I will always be here to fight for you. Yes, I will. And what a great future you're going to have, because you know what? One day Spaulding Enterprises is going to be all yours. That's right. It's going to be all yours.",
        "Jeffrey: You know, Marah, I didn't know you were going to show up here. If I had known that you were going to...",
        "Marah: It's okay. You know, we can't go through life avoiding each other. We're bound to run into each other sometimes, so, I guess this can be practice.",
        "Jeffrey: An experiment.",
        "Marah: Right. Right. So you don't need to read me to know what my feelings are about you.",
        "(Cell phone rings)",
        "Marah: I have to take this.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay. Yeah. Take it.",
        "Marah: Carrie, for once you have perfect timing. What's this about? Right now? Yeah, I'll pick up Michelle. I can pick up Marina, too. She's already on her way? All right. Bye.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, Cassie Winslow is about as suited to this job as I am to sumo wrestling.",
        "Christopher: Yes, but there were definitely some signs of receptivity in Marah.",
        "Jeffrey: No, no. Not Marah.",
        "Christopher: Why are you so quick to discount her?",
        "Jeffrey: I'm not discounting anyone. I just... you know. Things are moving fast, okay? We don't have time to develop someone's skills. We need proven talent and we need it fast.",
        "Christopher: Meaning Reva?",
        "Jeffrey: Yes. It's your job to make sure that she's primed and ready, okay?",
        "Cassie: Well, I guess I proved this gift doesn't run in the family. Reva, what's wrong?",
        "Reva: My chest. My chest is tightening again. Is the sitter still here?",
        "Cassie: No, he left a while ago.",
        "Reva: I don't understand then, if he... I feel like I'm running out of air. It's gone. That was weird.",
        "Cassie: What do you think it was, some leftover sensation from the sitter?",
        "Reva: I don't know.",
        "Cassie: You know what? Why don't I drop you off at home on my way to Fifth Street?",
        "Reva: Fifth Street?",
        "Cassie: Yes, I have to go work the phones for Harley's Angels. Okay? Come on. Reva?",
        "Reva: It was just different this time than what I was picking up before.",
        "Cassie: You mean different from the sensation you had with the sitter?",
        "Reva: It wasn't just about not being able to breathe. It was more. It was... I was trapped in the dark.",
        "Josh: Sounded like a collapse.",
        "Buzz: You were the ones making all the noise.",
        "Billy: Shh.",
        "Josh: Both of you just shut up. This whole thing is unstable. It could collapse at any minute.",
        "Billy: Look on the bright side. Maybe the guy we're looking for is buried under a tunnel of rubble.",
        "Josh: Why don't we get out of here before it happens to us?",
        "Alexandra: Next on Guiding Light...",
        "Alan: I just don't want you to get caught in the cross-fire, that's all.",
        "Gus: I can't believe it. You're trying to get rid of me.",
        "Young Man: Talk? I don't think so."
