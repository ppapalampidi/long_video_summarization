        "Buzz: Two hot ones coming through!",
        "Reva: Buzz is a real whirlwind today.",
        "Sandy: Uh, well, like I was saying, I think we should tape in the studio on wednesday and do the remote on thursday.",
        "Buzz: (Breathing heavily): Party of two? Right over here. I've got your buttons for you, got bumper stickers for you, I've got flyers for you to tell you all about the evil spaulding family, the scourge of the earth and how they're trying to destroy me and my family.",
        "Reva: Buzz?",
        "Buzz: Hey, gorgeous.",
        "Reva: Hi, honey. Well, you know what? Take a break?",
        "Buzz: I can'T. I've got bulldozers around the corner. I've got to make every second count.",
        "Reva: Okay. Okay. Then at least take a deep breath because you're panting like you just ran a marathon.",
        "Buzz: (Panting): The fan broke in the kitchen. It's like an oven in there.",
        "Reva: Can I tell you something?",
        "Buzz: What?",
        "Reva: I really wanted to do a story on your situation here, but my new boss, weasel that he is, nixed the whole idea.",
        "Buzz: (Laughs bitterly) probably a crony of phillip spaulding'S.",
        "Reva: Actually, my new boss is phillip spaulding. He bought wsbr.",
        "Buzz: (Panting)",
        "Reva: Are you okay?",
        "Buzz: Yeah. That guy's got to be stopped. Then I'll be okay.",
        "Phillip: You know, the next time the governor calls, hilary, you do not put him on hold. Do you understand?",
        "Hilda: Yes, sir.",
        "Phillip: He's the governor, hilary. Of the state.",
        "Hilda: Yes, sir. I'm sorry, sir. And by the way? My name is hilda, sir.",
        "Gus: Hm. Well, brother, next time you don't remember her name, why don't you just go, \"hey, yo! Servant!\" Why don't you do that?",
        "Phillip: Oh, gus. Champion of the little people.",
        "Gus: I prefer \"hero of the little people,\" thank you very much.",
        "Phillip: Well, you've definitely got some attraction for them, because I cannot fathom for an instant why you are standing by the coopers after they turned their back on you and humiliated you the way they did.",
        "Gus: So compassion is weakness in your book?",
        "Phillip: Only if it means that your loyalties are divided and you can't effectively represent the best interests of spaulding enterprises.",
        "Gus: Phillip-- and this is for the last time-- I told you, since I'm back on board, okay, i will do my job. And I will. Like a good little soldier, i will. Okay? So who do we crush next?",
        "Harley: Okay, so you guys want to take down phillip and spaulding enterprises via the business route, some kind of overthrow.",
        "Olivia: Some kind of overthrow?",
        "Harley: We are never going to take away all of phillip's power all at once. Never. We have to chip away at it.",
        "Bill: Death by a thousand cuts.",
        "Harley: Exactly. So I say we concentrate on saving company first, dealing him a loss.",
        "Olivia: How did I know you were going to say that?",
        "Harley: Olivia, you may have the business sense, but when it comes to people, I'm on it, okay? We have to make spaulding look bad. So, we have to get all the stockholders and all the potential stockholders to turn against them, and I say company is a great rallying point for that.",
        "Olivia: No offense, but it's a little restaurant. We're talking about a company that makes multi-millions of dollars.",
        "Harley: I wouldn't expect you to understand about family...",
        "Bill: Okay, ladies. Ladies. Ladies. Let'S... okay, all this bickering is hurting my old tum- tum. All right, we all want the same thing, right? Take spauldings down.",
        "Harley: Right.",
        "Bill: Right.",
        "Olivia: Right.",
        "Bill: Right.",
        "Olivia: So, tell harley why her plan is not viable.",
        "Bill: Can't do that, olivia, because I happen to think she's right.",
        "Tony: Hey, michelle.",
        "Michelle: Tony.",
        "Tony: What?",
        "Michelle: You scared me.",
        "Tony: I saw you pull in. What are you doing here? You want the rest of your stuff?",
        "Michelle: Yeah. What are you doing here?",
        "Tony: Well, I... the house is mine now. I bought it from danny. It sounds a little crazy, but it actually makes a lot of sense.",
        "Michelle: Wow. I guess danny was right. You really do want everything he has.",
        "Tony: Look, michelle, i bought this house for one reason, okay? To help put some cash in danny's pocket. All right? Now when he gets back on his feet and he's working, he's got a paying gig, I told him that he could buy the house back from me. That was the deal that we made, you know? I mean, it's like, you know, you try to do something nice... in fact, I hate this place.",
        "Michelle: Whoa, whoa. Okay, I was kidding. I was kidding you. I probably like this place less than you do, but I know that it means a lot to danny, so I think that what you did was really nice.",
        "Tony: Well, at least someone sees it that way.",
        "Michelle: You know, the way you were going on and on like that, it seemed like you really thought I was serious. Did you?",
        "Tony: You know, I'm tired of hearing that from people. I've been told that all my life.",
        "Michelle: Okay. All right. Sore subject.",
        "Tony: Yeah.",
        "Michelle: Duly noted. I'm going over to the lighthouse now. Do you want to come? I'm going to check out the drawings the designer did and make some notes.",
        "Tony: It's a waste of time. I mean, ross is still blocking the permit. Why would you go?",
        "Michelle: Tony... you just... you know, you've got to forget about the stupid permits. The only way this place is going to happen is if we make it happen. So, going to come with me? Because I have some great ideas.",
        "Tony: (Laughs) well, unfortunately, you're going to have to do it on your own because I have a lot of stuff to do around here.",
        "Michelle: Oh, what stuff?",
        "Tony: I've got stuff to do. Go. Go on, get out of here. Go on.",
        "Michelle: Okay. Your loss.",
        "Buzz: First phillip pulls a sneak attack on company. Then he takes over the local station so honest reporters like you can't get the word out. I mean, that's the definition of sleaze.",
        "Reva: Well, he won't get away with this.",
        "Buzz: (Breathing heavily): No, he won'T. Excuse me.",
        "Reva: What do you say we talk about stories that we can do?",
        "Sandy: Okay. Sounds good to me.",
        "Reva: What we have to start with is some hard research. You know, facts and figures about how many kids actually out there have found their biological parents. Do a show. The adoption show.",
        "Sandy: Yeah. Yeah, you know, we don't have the okay from phillip on that.",
        "Reva: Well, it doesn't challenge phillip's power base at all. We're going to do this show, whether he likes it or not.",
        "Sandy: You know you're asking for trouble, reva.",
        "Reva: From phillip or from you? Look, I know that you don't like the idea of this show, but at least I've gotten past the idea of you being an interviewee. You know, on camera? And all I really need from you is your insight and your ideas about the whole thing.",
        "Sandy: If I don't want to give them, what, am I fired?",
        "Reva: Sandy, there are thousands of kids out there searching for their biological mothers, and then there are thousands out there who have found them just like you. This is A... it's a rich human topic and I think it's worth doing.",
        "Sandy: Knock yourself out. Do it without me.",
        "Reva: Where are you going?",
        "Sandy: I have an appointment I forgot about.",
        "Bill: Okay, this isn't just about saving company, okay?",
        "Olivia: No, exactly. We have bigger fish to fry.",
        "Bill: But any loss for phillip is a win for us, especially a public one.",
        "Olivia: All right, fine. That makes sense, but can we keep our eye on the bigger picture, please?",
        "Bill: Always.",
        "Olivia: So what do we do? Do we print more lovely flyers and little \"save company\" buttons and hand them out? What?",
        "Harley: No. I will let my family handle that stuff. Defending ourselves is important, but so is being on the offensive, which is where we come in. We're going to take the fight to phillip.",
        "Bill: A girl after your own heart, isn't she?",
        "Olivia: What does that mean?",
        "Harley: It means that I've already got mel boudreau working on getting the applications that phillip filed to secure eminent domain.",
        "Bill: Has she had any luck?",
        "Harley: Of course not. It's the same thing every day: \"It's in the mail, it's in the mail.\"",
        "Olivia: So what? So what? You're a private detective. Why don't you just find the documents another way?",
        "Harley: You're right. You're right. I need to take this a step further. I'm not going to play by their rules.",
        "Olivia: Who is she calling?",
        "Bill: I have no idea, but she's got an evil look in her eye.",
        "Harley: Spaulding legal department, please. Hello, this is stacey collier, mark berkowitz's assistant at berkowitz smith hoyt and weintraub in new york city. Who am I speaking with? Hello, alice. Yes, we have some confidential contracts en route to your office via air courier. They need to be hand delivered to your chief counsel and signed by him asap. Do you have any idea where he'll be in the next half hour? Perfect. Thank you so very much. He's at the spaulding mansion right now.",
        "Bill: (Laughs) very good.",
        "Olivia: Okay, so how does that help us?",
        "Harley: It helps us because i am going to threaten to shove him face first into the pool unless he gives me the stupid papers. Or I could just steal his briefcase.",
        "Olivia: Okay, it's working for me. Now it's working for me. While you're there, why don't you corral some servants and just see if they know what phillip is up to?",
        "Harley: Oh, so now you like my little talking-to-the- servants idea.",
        "Olivia: It was a good idea, okay? I just needed time to get my head around it.",
        "Harley: All right, guys. I'm heading to the big house.",
        "Bill: All right. Now, are you sure you're going to be all right through this alone?",
        "Harley: Oh, please. I am looking forward to putting the screws to this creep. Excuse me?",
        "Gus: Hilda.",
        "Harley: Black, two sugars.",
        "Gus: Yeah, I said I didn't want another cup of coffee.",
        "Harley: Aw, heck, I knew you didn't mean that. Just like you di't mean a lot of the things you've said. Living here, in the mausoleum? Ugh, sterile city. Now you and me and the kids in my place? That was nice. Lots of laughter, love. Well, at least you've got the memories, right? Too bad that's all you've got. Unless you've had a change of heart? Unless you want us back enough to sacrifice for us.",
        "Gus: Of course I do. You're killing me here. You're making me choose between my family and your family.",
        "Harley: Please. There's no contest. Do you want me back or don't you?",
        "Gus: Of course I want you back. Of course I do. Of course I do.",
        "Buzz: No. No one from spaulding enterprises is to set foot on my property.",
        "Billy: Buzz, who was that?",
        "Buzz: (Breathing heavily): Phillip's structural engineer. He says he needs access to this property prior to demolition. Not while I'm kicking.",
        "Billy: Hey, you know, I've been giving your situation a lot of thought here, and I think you can beat phillip at his own game. Josh and I came up with an idea. How about you let josh and i relocate you?",
        "Buzz: Relocate me?",
        "Billy: We pick the whole place up lock, stock and tomahawk, and we set it down wherever you want. And I've got a couple of good places in mind.",
        "Buzz: You are a beautiful man, but no one is chasing me out of here, and that's it.",
        "Billy: Look, I appreciate your spunk and I think fighting back is good, but the fact is...",
        "Buzz: No, the fact is, when the diner went down, when it burned down for the second time, I started again from scratch. This is it. I don't plan to do that again. Phillip can build his... you know, his mall, whatever the heck he wants to build, someplace else!",
        "Billy: Hey, you know, the truth of the matter is that the state passed on it and the governor signed off on it. He's got a lot of money. No, you can stall him, but odds say that he's going to win.",
        "Phillip: He's right, buzz.",
        "Buzz: There's the door. Use it.",
        "Phillip: I can see you're not feeling sociable. That's all right. I'll seat myself.",
        "Billy: Why don't you just leave?",
        "Phillip: You're turning away a paying customer?",
        "Buzz: This is still my property. I want you to leave. Either do it of your own free will or I will make it happen.",
        "Phillip: You're threatening me.",
        "Buzz: I know what you're thinking: \"He's old, he's out of shape, I'll take him out with one punch.\" Before you make a stupid mistake, chew on this: I am against the wall. I have nothing to lose. You do. So bring it on. Come on, I'm begging you.",
        "Reva: So, your appointment was with a pool cue.",
        "Sandy: It's a good way to blow off some steam.",
        "Reva: Steam that would otherwise be directed at me?",
        "Sandy: I'm not mad at you, reva. I just don't feel like talking.",
        "Reva: Well, then let's not talk. Let's play. Eight ball. It's the only game I know. (Laughs) but I should warn you, I'm not very good at it.",
        "Sandy: Oh, neither am I.",
        "Reva: Right.",
        "Sandy: Right.",
        "Reva: No, I'm serious, I'm really bad at this. (Laughs)",
        "Sandy: So am I.",
        "Reva: (Laughs) yeah, right.",
        "Sandy: Right.",
        "Reva: Okay, here's the deal. Whoever sinks a ball gets to ask the other person a question.",
        "Sandy: I thought we weren't doing the talking.",
        "Reva: We're not talking. We're asking and answering, questioning and answering.",
        "Sandy: Could you split that hair any finer?",
        "Reva: Oh, you know what? You're smiling. That must mean you want to play.",
        "Sandy: Okay. If you buy me lunch.",
        "Reva: And why am I supposed to buy you lunch?",
        "Sandy: Because the losers always buy. And you're going to lose.",
        "Reva: Ooh, baby. Them's fighting words.",
        "Michelle: I knew you wanted to come with me. See, you love this place as much as I do. What the...?",
        "Tony: Hey! Hey! Who are you guys, huh?",
        "Guy #1: You live here?",
        "Michelle: This is private property, okay? It's my property. I'll ask the questions.",
        "Guy #2: What's going on with the construction upstairs?",
        "Michelle: I'm building a restaurant and a club, not that it's any of your business.",
        "Guy #1: That's not a good idea.",
        "Tony: No, what's not a good idea is you being here, man.",
        "Guy #2: Keep it up and you could get hurt.",
        "Michelle: Oh, really? Who's going to hurt me, huh? Are you going to hurt me? Look, tony, look. The big, mean men. I'm so scared, I'm shaking all over.",
        "Phillip: That's okay, I'll just sit at the bar.",
        "Billy: Whoa, whoa. Buzz, no, wait. Look, just calm down. Hurting him is not going to help your cause.",
        "Buzz: Get him out of here.",
        "Billy: Okay, you go back and cool off. (Sighs) phillip, look, why don't you just leave?",
        "Phillip: Well, billy, actually, I'd be more than happy to leave. But as much as I'd like to let buzz foam at the mouth in peace, I'm meeting a business associate.",
        "Billy: Why don't you do it somewhere else?",
        "Phillip: Well, I guess i could.",
        "Billy: I mean, beating a guy fair, square or dirty-handed is okay, but rubbing his face in it, that's another thing.",
        "Phillip: Yeah. Well, let me tell you, I think you have a lot bigger things to worry about than your old pal, buzz. Have you seen who your son has picked for a business partner?",
        "Bill: What was that all about?",
        "Billy: Just phillip being phillip. So, I hear you two have something to tell me. What, you wait to tell me in a week or two?",
        "Bill: No, no. Soon as I saw you. Soon as I saw you. There you go. Slingshot enterprises. What do you think of that logo, huh? (Cell phone rings)",
        "Billy: Ah, excuse me.",
        "Olivia: Saved by the ring. You know what? Let's clear this and sit here.",
        "Bill: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,",
        "Olivia: I've been wanting to tell you that I think this thing that phillip is doing is bigger than we originally thought.",
        "Bill: All right, how's that?",
        "Olivia: When I called you from the house, he and alan were having a meeting. They were acting really weird-- weirder than usual-- and he also called a special meeting of the board for select shareholders to, you know, \"preview the new corporate strategy,\" as he put it.",
        "Bill: All right. Well, I can't wait to hear what he has to say.",
        "Olivia: Well, you're not going to, because we didn't make the cut. We're not select enough. He excluded us from the meeting.",
        "Bill: Oh, wait a minute now. Can he do that?",
        "Olivia: He can try.",
        "Bill: You want to crash the meeting, huh?",
        "Olivia: Oh, I do, I do. Don't you?",
        "Buzz: Out. Now.",
        "Phillip: Buzz, please try to calm down. I promise you it will all be over soon.",
        "Harley: Hilda!",
        "Hilda: Harley. Hi.",
        "Harley: Hi. Oh, it's good to see you.",
        "Hilda: Good to see you.",
        "Harley: How are you?",
        "Hilda: Good. Harley, I'm so sorry to hear about you and mr. Gus. You looked so beautiful in your wedding dress, and I was so happy for you both that day.",
        "Harley: Thanks. Yeah, well, you know, things happen for a reason, right?",
        "Hilda: Well, if you're here to see mr. Gus...",
        "Harley: No, no, no, no. If I never see mr. Gus again, it will be too soon. No, actually, I heard that the spaulding legal counsel is here and I have a bone to pick with him, so I'll catch you on the way out, okay?",
        "Hilda: Oh...",
        "Harley: Thanks, hilda.",
        "Hilda: But harley...",
        "Harley: Excuse me? Sorry. Uh, I was looking for the spaulding legal counsel. Have you seen him?",
        "Gus: You're looking at him.",
        "Sandy: Coming up on \"guiding light.\"",
        "Olivia: The way david slew goliath, bill and I are going to go up against spaulding and we're going to win.",
        "Billy: You should try and find yourself another business partner.",
        "Phillip: This is buzz cooper. He's the owner of this fine establishment. This is pete langtree of langtree demolition. Oprah: Our first-ever celebrity spouse challen",
        "Reva: Score!",
        "Sandy: So, you're not very good at this?",
        "Reva: I may have underestimated myself a little, but I get to ask you a question now.",
        "Sandy: Shoot.",
        "Reva: When you found out you were adopted, were you surprised or did you suspect it all along?",
        "Sandy: Suspected it all along.",
        "Reva: And did you at the time...",
        "Sandy: One question. Unless you want to make another shot?",
        "Reva: Oh. No problem. Oh, this isn't fair. Oh.",
        "Sandy: Too bad-- for you. 13, corner pocket.",
        "Reva: Ooh, great shot. Okay, you get to ask a question.",
        "Sandy: No, I think I'll pass. I'll go for six...",
        "Reva: Sandy, wait. You can ask a question. There has to be something you want to know.",
        "Sandy: Okay. Did you ever wonder if you made the right choice, leaving your child?",
        "Reva: I agonized over it. But at the time, it was the only way I could keep you safe from edmund.",
        "Sandy: And after edmund was no longer a threat?",
        "Reva: There were so many years that I don't even remember. And when I went back to san cristobal, when it all started coming back to me, I had to choose all over again, and i believe I made the right choice. You know, richard and I came to see you when you were still a little boy. That was when I told you that i was your fairy godmother. You remember that, I know you did, because you mentioned it to me.",
        "Sandy: Yeah.",
        "Reva: We had the most incredible day on the beach, fishing, we built sand castles. You were so happy. \"Well-adjusted\" was the way marissa put it. If I had any inkling at all of how miserable you were...",
        "Sandy: Your shot.",
        "Reva: I loved you and i thought about you every day, and every day that you weren't with me, a piece of my life was missing.",
        "Sandy: You... do you feel whole now?",
        "Reva: Yeah. Do you?",
        "Sandy: I'm working on it.",
        "Reva: I'm so proud of who you are, and I'm so glad that you came home to me.",
        "Sandy: You know, let's forget the game. I'm hungry.",
        "Reva: (Laughs) now, wait a minute. We have to finish the game, or else we don't know who's buying lunch.",
        "Sandy: Oh, right. Okay. Eight ball, corner pocket. Ah, look at that.",
        "Reva: You could have made that shot with your eyes closed. You missed on purpose. Why?",
        "Sandy: Gee whiz. Can't a son do something nice for his mama without all these questions?",
        "Reva: (Laughs)",
        "Michelle: So, you guys know who this is? Huh? Do you? You don't, do you? This is tony santos. Bet you didn't know that, huh? And you guys are pussycats compared to the goons he's got on his payroll. So, are you packing? Hm? Let me see. Let me see the heat. Let me see what you got.",
        "Tony: Get out of here. Get out of here!",
        "Michelle: Oh. Aw, come on. You going so soon? We were just starting to have fun. Yeah, that's right, you better run, you chicken. And don't think I don't know who sent you! Danny sent those guys. He's trying to scare me so i won't build the restaurant. It's not going to work, tony.",
        "Tony: And you're sure those were danny's guys, right?",
        "Phillip: Yeah, well, that's fine. However it works.",
        "Bill: So that's all phillip said about this special board meeting? Nothing specific?",
        "Olivia: No, no, that's it. But do you want to hear my idea on how we can crash it?",
        "Bill: Well, we've got to get past spaulding security.",
        "Olivia: That's not a problem. We can do that. My... (cell phone ringing)",
        "Bill: Sorry, I'm going to have to take this, all right?",
        "Olivia: All right.",
        "Bill: I'll be right back.",
        "Billy: So, just what is it exactly you got going on with my boy?",
        "Olivia: Boy? No, billy, he's a full-grown man.",
        "Billy: Look, I know all the grief you caused my little brother. I hope you're not trying to reprise that song.",
        "Olivia: Well, just so you know, that grief was a two-way street. But you can relax, because bill and I are just business partners.",
        "Billy: Slingshot enterprises?",
        "Olivia: The way david slew goliath? Bill and I are going to go up against spaulding and we're going to win.",
        "Billy: You're going to use my boy to get back at phillip.",
        "Olivia: You don't think that phillip deserves his comeuppance?",
        "Billy: No, no. What I think is that you should try and find yourself another business partner.",
        "Bill: Dad? Lay off her.",
        "Harley: This is great. This is just great.",
        "Gus: What are you talking about? I told you that I had to come back and work for spaulding, didn't I?",
        "Harley: Yeah, but this?",
        "Gus: I am going to help you and your brother and your father.",
        "Harley: How am I supposed to believe that? You're not pushing papers for them. You're not just crunching numbers anymore. You're head of their legal department!",
        "Gus: Which means what? Think about it. It means I'm privy to every single move they make before they make it.",
        "Harley: What does that mean? What are you saying?",
        "Gus: What do you think I'm saying?",
        "Harley: Are you saying that you're going to work against alan and phillip undercover to stop this development project? Is that what you're saying?",
        "Gus: I can't stop it because I don't have the authority. But listen, I can slow it down. I can give your side more time.",
        "Harley: Tell me this: What was the point in withholding the paperwork from mel?",
        "Gus: Because, honey, if i send them paperwork, she has to legally respond to it. This way, if I drag my heels, she can go to a judge and go, \"hey, that side is holding up the works.\" It gives them more time. It gives you more time.",
        "Harley: But you could get blamed for that.",
        "Gus: \"Phillip, I'm so sorry. I don't understand what happened. I guess that my whole plan backfired.\" Look, the way that I look at it, if I can just get him to focus on something else, maybe he'll not go ahead and destroy company.",
        "Harley: You don't understand. This is not about business. This is personal for him. Phillip is targeting us.",
        "Gus: This is personal for me as well.",
        "Langtree: Mr. Spaulding?",
        "Phillip: Mr. Langtree! How was your ride from centerville? Did you find it okay?",
        "Langtree: It was fine.",
        "Phillip: Good, good. Well, let's have a seat over here. Do you like burgers? They've got great ones here. Oh, buzz, there's somebody I'd actually like you to meet. This is buzz cooper. He's the owner of this fine establishment. This is pete langtree, of langtree demolition. Yeah, pete and his crew are the ones that are going to tear this place down.",
        "Sandy: So you've never played",
        "Sandy: So you've never played nine ball? You'd love it; it's ruthless.",
        "Reva: You know, I am so glad you inherited the pool gene from me. Marah and shayne, they never really had it, but your grandpa hawk, he has it, too. I've seen him make some incredible shots.",
        "Sandy: Marah and shayne just weren't interested?",
        "Reva: Marah is an incredible card player, but shayne always had so many other sports on his mind. You know, when they come home, we're going to get together and have another family game night.",
        "Sandy: Oh, great.",
        "Reva: Oh, come on. That was fun. When they come home... huh, seems so far away. Thank you, sandy.",
        "Sandy: For what?",
        "Reva: For keeping me company. For letting me win. You're a good son. Thanks.",
        "Sandy: Ha. I'm paying, remember?",
        "Reva: No, not really.",
        "Sandy: Yes, really. I'm flush now, as soon as I get my first check from the station.",
        "Reva: Oh, that reminds me. Money, money, money. I hope you don't mind that i filled out all the information here.",
        "Sandy: What is this, from the payroll department?",
        "Reva: Yeah, it's a legal document, but you can't sign it as sandy foster. You have to sign it as jonathan randall.",
        "Sandy: Ah, right. So they can withhold so much for taxes that I might as well not even work at all.",
        "Reva: You know what? I wouldn't worry about that, though. Poverty is not going to be an issue for you. What you signed is not a payroll form. It's the official release on your trust fund.",
        "Michelle: I better not get his voice mail. Danny? Hey, guess who? That's right, it's your wife! You know, the one that you have no faith in? Look, I know you don't like the idea of tony and I building this club together, but there are other ways to get your point across than sending a couple of bruisers over here to trash the place. What? No, no. No, I was kidding. I'm kidding. I... it was a joke. It was a joke. No, it was a dumb... it was a bad joke. It was really... you know what? That's my other line. I've got to go.",
        "Tony: Not danny's guys, huh?",
        "Michelle: Oh, tony. What did I just do? I just chased these guys away with an oar. Tony. Oh, no.",
        "Tony: Well, you scared them. (Laughs)",
        "Michelle: (Laughs) I did, didn't I?",
        "Tony: Well, the question is: If they weren't danny's guys, who are they and what do they want?",
        "Gus: I can help you, and all you have to do is let me. That's all.",
        "Harley: Why should I believe you?",
        "Gus: Because I love you.",
        "Harley: No. No. Because you're living in this house and you're working with them, and you've already lied to protect them.",
        "Gus: Well, I'm going to help you whether you want me to or not.",
        "Harley: You want to help me? Go get those papers. Go get the documents on the eminent domain and hand them over to me now. That's how you can help me.",
        "Gus: They're in the other room. I'll get them.",
        "Hilda: Harley? I'm sorry. I tried to tell you mr. Gus was in here.",
        "Harley: Don't even worry about it, hilda. Wait. Wait, before you go. Look, I don't want to get you into any trouble or anything, but I'm worried about phillip, you know? Do you think he's okay? He's been so, kind of, wired lately, you know? And he is the father of my son and I'm wondering, do you have any idea what's going on with him?",
        "Hilda: No, but you're right. He has been upset about something, business I think. He goes out at all hours by himself. It's very strange.",
        "Harley: Yeah, that is strange. Do you have any idea where he goes?",
        "Hilda: No.",
        "Harley: Well, if you should find out, would you just let me know?",
        "Hilda: Of course. Harley? Maybe it's not my place, but the one you should be worried about isn't mr. Phillip. It's mr. Gus. He really misses you.",
        "Buzz: Hey, hold it. I thought you were going to stay for lunch.",
        "Billy: No way. Come on. With phillip spaulding on one side of the room and olivia, who is about to ruin my son's life because of phillip spaulding on the other side of the room, buzz, too much spaulding for this old boy. Look, you better take it easy because you look beat.",
        "Buzz: Well, another family at odds thanks to spaulding enterprises. Congratulations. Hey, you guys... you guys are going to stay, right?",
        "Olivia: No, I lost my appetite, you know, with...",
        "Bill: Hey, we got your back, okay?",
        "Buzz: Choke on it.",
        "Phillip: Oh, buzz? That little announcement that you just made? That was completely unprofessional and totally unnecessary.",
        "Buzz: When I think that my grandson has to grow up with you as a father, that makes me sick.",
        "Phillip: (Laughs) well, I find that very funny, coming from you. Oh, and buzz? A little update on the date of the demolition?",
        "Buzz: Oh, leave me alone. I know when it is. I know when...",
        "Phillip: No, you don't, because I've just changed my mind. We're going to tear it down next week.",
        "Harley: Is that everything?",
        "Gus: That's everything you need.",
        "Harley: Great. Well, I'm going to head over to company to look these over with my dad.",
        "Gus: Can I come with you?",
        "Harley: Why would I want you to do that?",
        "Gus: Well, I could point out certain clauses, you know, to mel.",
        "Harley: Well, you know, mel's pretty sharp. I think she can find the clauses herself.",
        "Gus: Coop? When are you going to cut me some slack?",
        "Harley: I don't know. Maybe when I can look at you without feeling sick or hurt.",
        "Gus: That's because... that's because you still love me. (Sighs)",
        "Tony: Nothing'S... nothing's out of place?",
        "Michelle: Everything is out of place. What do you mean?",
        "Tony: Look, you know what i mean.",
        "Michelle: Nothing is missing, if that's what you mean. No.",
        "Tony: All right, well, then what were they looking for?",
        "Michelle: I don't know. Maybe they were just trying to scare me, you know? Maybe they just wanted to vandalize the place and we walked in and we surprised them.",
        "Tony: Maybe.",
        "Michelle: Well, what are you thinking?",
        "Tony: Well, I'm thinking that we've got a bigger problem on our hands, michelle. You know, not just zoning variances, not just block permits. Somebody doesn't want us in this lighthouse and by the looks of it, they mean it. They mean business.",
        "Reva: I hope you don't mind i took the liberty. I mean, we discussed this, that this was the year that you were going to come into your trust, and when the bank sent over the paperwork... I mean, all you have to do is you go down to the bank, you show them some id that proves that you're jonathan. Are you okay?",
        "Sandy: Yeah, yeah. Wow. A lot to wrap my head around, though.",
        "Reva: So I thought we'd take the release down to the bank later and you can show them your passport...",
        "Sandy: No. I don't want to do that.",
        "Reva: Why? Why not?",
        "Sandy: I don't want the money.",
        "Reva: Sandy, we've been over this before.",
        "Sandy: Mm-hmm, we have. And I still feel the same way. Every trust-fund baby I've ever met is beyond messed up. I don't want to become one of them.",
        "Reva: Not you. You're who you are.",
        "Sandy: Reva, read my lips: I don't want the money.",
        "Reva: Okay. Can we make a compromise?",
        "Sandy: I don't want to compromise, either.",
        "Reva: Fine. Then I'll just fax this back to the bank. They wanted them back as soon as possible. And when you're more rational, then you can go in...",
        "Sandy: I am rational. You're just not listening.",
        "Reva: Then you better come up with a very valid reason for why you don't want the money, otherwise your friends are going to give you a very hard time tonight.",
        "Sandy: My friends, tonight?",
        "Reva: Oh, you know what? I didn't even tell you. (Laughs) I'm throwing you a birthday bash at the house later. Nothing formal. Just informal. And you can't protest because i intend to spoil you rotten. Thanks for lunch.",
        "Sandy: You're welcome.",
        "Reva: Bye.",
        "Sandy: Yeah, hi. I got a question. How does one go about claiming a trust fund at your bank? No, no, no. Actually, I need to know exactly what kind of identification is required.",
        "Buzz: No, I will die defending this place! This place is my life and you will not take it from me!",
        "Langtree: Mr. Cooper...",
        "Buzz: Shut up! Shut up! You hear me? You hear me? I have failed in the past, but not this time! This time you do not win, I do not quit! You like the burgers here, huh? You like the burgers? You like to throw your money around like a big guy? Here. Well, eat this. (Plates crashing) you want a bulldozer? I've got your bulldozer!",
        "Gus: Hey! You just ran through two red lights.",
        "Harley: That's because you were tailing me the whole time. Go away.",
        "Gus: Why do you have to be so stubborn? Please, just admit it.",
        "Harley: Admit what?",
        "Gus: Just look at me... look at my face...",
        "Phillip: Hey, I'm glad you're here. Maybe you can calm him down.",
        "Harley: Who?",
        "Phillip: Your father nearly attacked me. He's lost it.",
        "Harley: Why do you think he's lost it? God, phillip. God, I hate you! I hate you! I hate all of you spauldings! Every one that ever walked the face of the earth!",
        "Phillip: Well, I guess it would be pointless to remind you that your son-- our son-- is also a spaulding.",
        "Harley: That's because I was stupid enough to marry you.",
        "Phillip: Sorry I brought it up. Come on, pete. (Crash)",
        "Gus: What was that?",
        "Harley: I don't know. Oh, my god. Daddy. Call 911! Call 911! Daddy? Next, on \"guiding light.\"",
        "Harley: Stay away from me. It's because of you that my father is in there fighting for his life.",
        "Michelle: You know, would it be so hard for people to actually give tony a chance?",
        "Mel: Michelle, tony is taking advantage of you."
