    "Recap": [
        "Instead of saying hell no, all Brooke says to Ridge is she wants him to be sure. He replies it will mean the world to him if she says yes and marries him. Thorne tells Eric that Ridge is not capable of committing to Brooke but he is. Liam drops in on Bill who thought he was going home to be with his wife. Bill says work is important but do not forget what comes first \u0096 his wife. Liam says he appreciates Bill's support and they have come a long way. He and Steffy might not even be speaking to each other if it had not been for Bill. Steffy made him see Bill's good points, his loyalty to his family and he does not take that lightly. Eric tells Thorne that he knows Brooke cares for Ridge and he always supported them to get back together but he too wonders if another round is good for either of them. Ridge tells Brooke that he knows before he has always screwed up on his commitment and Brooke would be questioning that now, but he sees their future clearly. She goes into his arms and says yes she will be his wife again. Steffy tells the doctor that she has been all stressed out but that seems to be behind her now. The doctor says good; she will go check on her blood tests.",
        "Liam asks if Bill would like to come over and have dinner but Bill declines and says they need time alone. Liam apologizes for going on and on about how happy he is again and that must hurt Bill right now so he will try to be more sensitive. But the next thing out of his mouth is about Brooke. Bill realizes that he will never have her again. But he does not begrudge Liam's happiness with Steffy so he should go be with her. They hug. Thorne tells Eric that if Ridge cannot change then he needs to be gone \u0096 out of Forrester Creations and out of Brooke's life. Quinn walks in on the conversation and says that may be too late. She knows nothing definitive but the way Ridge has been acting she thinks he might have other things on his mind other than leaving. Upstairs Ridge tries to get Brooke to put on the ring. He tells her she is the most beautiful woman he knows and proceeds to undress her and then lays her on the bed where he romantically kisses her shoulders, legs and finally mouth. Later he tells her there is no doubt they should be together. They are going to be okay. They have a future together forever and later the ring will be on her finger where it belongs. Liam shows up at the doctor's office surprising Steffy. He says after everything that has happened he just wanted her to know he was there for her. The doctor comes in and is not sure she can speak in front of Liam. Steffy says it is okay. Both go crazy when she says according to the blood test she is pregnant. Steffy is ecstatic ..until she suddenly remembers her night with Bill."

        "Brooke: Are you sure about this?",
        "Ridge: Hey, I know there's no heart in the sand, and no exotic location, but I wanted to do this here, in the house where we dreamed about growing old together. You want to do that? You want to grow old with me?",
        "Eric: You said this to brooke? That you want a future with her?",
        "Thorne: Yeah. I did. When I came back to L.A., I had every intention of keeping my feelings to myself. Then I found out what ridge did with your wife. Brooke deserves better, and ridge is not capable of committing to her. But I am.",

        "Steffy: Hi! Steffy, good to see you. You're just here for a check-up, right?",
        "Steffy: Mm-hmm. Yeah. And how have you been doing?",
        "Steffy: Great. I mean, you know, life -- newly married, newly C.E.O. - There's some stress, but no complaints. Well, I'm a big fan of no complaints. We're just gonna run some routine tests. Choose an arm.",
        "Steffy: I pick this one. Great.",

        "Liam: Hey.",
        "Bill: Hey. What are you doing here? I thought you went home to your wife.",
        "Liam: Yeah, well, steffy had an appointment. I figured I'd kill some time here, maybe knock some items off tomorrow's to-do list.",
        "Bill: Definitely my son.",
        "Liam: [ Laughs ]",
        "Bill: Work's important. But remember what comes first.",
        "Liam: Uh...money?",
        "Bill: No. Steffy.",
        "Liam: Oh! [ Laughs ] I thought -- no, yeah, believe me, I know, and given everything we've been through lately, I'm gonna make sure she knows it, too. Actually, I'm gonna apologize in advance because that may mean more days like this, where i have to get a little creative with my office hours. Hope that's cool.",
        "Bill: No problem. In fact, I encourage.",
        "Liam: Well, I appreciate the support. We have come a long way.",
        "Bill: Yeah, we have.",
        "Liam: Thanks to steffy. I mean, you and I -- you and I might not even be speaking to each other if she hadn't gotten in the middle. 110/70. That's good.",
        "Steffy: Good. How's your diet?",
        "Steffy: Healthy enough. Drink much?",
        "Steffy: Well, like, I have a glass of wine at dinner. But I work out and I get enough sleep. Tell me about the stress you mentioned earlier. It must be tough running a fashion house.",
        "Steffy: Oh, yeah. But it's not work-related. Is it personal then?",
        "Liam: It's actually funny. You know why I think steffy was so successful in bringing us together?",
        "Bill: Why?",
        "Liam: I was so obsessed with our differences, you know, trying to find fault in you -- I even took pleasure in it. And I'm not proud to admit that. But steffy made me realize I was overlooking your best quality. No! Not your hair.",
        "Bill: Not my hair?",
        "Liam: Good as it is, not your hair.",
        "Bill: Then I don't know.",
        "Liam: It's your loyalty to your family, especially your two sons, and I just -- I just want you to know that I really am grateful for your support, and I don't take that for granted anymore.",
        "Eric: I have to admit, you've kind of gotten into my head about all this. I've always been a big supporter of ridge and brooke reuniting, all of us getting a fresh start, but I have to wonder if this particular go-around is really wise. I know she cares for him.",
        "Thorne: Yeah, but is he good for her? No. Years of mistreating her, including this latest thing with your wife proves it. Brooke needs to be done with him, for good.",
        "Brooke: You want to hear the truth? I never really needed a heart in the sand or any of these big grand gestures that you've shown me through the years, although they've been nice. But, really, I just needed you, your love, and your commitment.",
        "Ridge: And somehow, I always found a way to screw that up. And you want to know why this time would be different.",
        "Brooke: Well, yeah. I'd be a fool not to.",
        "Ridge: Well, I'd be a bigger fool to make a promise that i can't keep. I want this. I want you. I want us. Here. I want that future. Man, I can see it. I can see it clearly.",
        "Brooke: I can see that same future. So, yes. Yes, I will be your wife. Again.",
        "Ridge: [ Laughs ]",
        "Brooke: And forever.",
        "Ridge: I love you.",
        "Brooke: I love you.",
        "Steffy: I didn't mean to make it sound like I'm all stressed out. I'm doing a lot better, actually. Well, if you ever want to talk to someone, I could recommend a great doctor --",
        "Steffy: Oh, no, no. I'm fine. Seriously. Okay. Well, then I guess we can just wrap this all up, then. I'm gonna go check your blood tests.",
        "Steffy: Okay. Go ahead and get dressed.",
        "Steffy: Sounds good. Thank you. Not stressed. Not anymore.",
        "Liam: So, you got dinner plans?",
        "Bill: You're not trying to invite me over, are you?",
        "Liam: Why not?",
        "Bill: Because I have no interest in being a third wheel.",
        "Liam: Oh, give me a break. Just come over. Let us feed you.",
        "Bill: Listen, uh... you guys just, uh, should spend time alone. That's time you need. What you don't need is daddy tagging along.",
        "Liam: Well, thank you, but i think my wife appreciates daddy as much as I do. Are you okay?",
        "Bill: Yeah. I'm fine.",
        "Liam: [ Sighs ] No, you're not. I'm so stupid. I'm being really insensitive right now, going on and on about how lucky I am to have someone, and I -- I know that hurts you, a lot. I'm sorry.",
        "Eric: Look, of course we both want what's best for brooke. But that's not up to us. Look, if ridge says that this time it's gonna be different and brooke believes him, what can we do about it?",
        "Thorne: We can set an example. We can show her that we won't let ridge walk all over us again.",
        "Eric: I stand up to ridge all the time.",
        "Thorne: You made him co-C.E.O.",
        "Eric: Yeah, well, that's --",
        "Thorne: Fire him, dad!",
        "Eric: Fire him? That's a little extreme, wouldn't you say?",
        "Thorne: Call it a leave of absence, if it makes you feel better, but I think ridge needs to take a time-out. It's warranted.",
        "Eric: [ Scoffs ]",
        "Thorne: He needs to think about his actions and how he treats people. I mean, do they have such a thing as narcissist rehab centers?",
        "Eric: Oh, for god's sake, thorne.",
        "Thorne: Look, if ridge can't change his ways, he needs to be gone. From the company and from brooke's life, for good.",
        "Quinn: Gone from brooke's life? Well, that's doubtful, considering he's probably proposing to her as we speak.",
        "Ridge: Let me put in on you.",
        "Brooke: Oh, wait! Wait. I don't know, ridge. I don't think I should put the ring on until my divorce is final with bill. I'm sorry, I don't want to disappoint you.",
        "Ridge: No, you're not disappointing me. It's the right thing to do and I respect you for it.",
        "Brooke: But there are certain things I do miss about our relationship.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, I miss those things, too.",
        "Brooke: Our long talks.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, the long talks were great. That was -- I... I remember other stuff.",
        "Brooke: Hmm. Well, why don't you show me what that other stuff is?",
        "Liam: You know, you fought so hard and waited so long to be with brooke, and now she's gone, and as happy as you want to be for me and my marriage, I want you to know it's okay to be upset about what happened.",
        "Bill: For a brief time... I had the best. I had exactly who I wanted. But I can't anymore. I'll never have her again, and i have to come to terms with that. I don't begrudge you having what I don'T. I want you to be happy. Just don't apologize for it. Now, you should go. Go be with her.",
        "Liam: You know what, I just might. Thanks, pop.",
        "Bill: For what?",
        "Liam: Being here.",
        "Bill: Always.",
        "Thorne: Proposing? What are you talking about?",
        "Quinn: Well, I don't know for sure, but let's just say the way he's been acting, I wouldn't be surprised.",
        "Ridge: Are you sure you don't want to put it on?",
        "Brooke: [ Laughs ] Of course I want to put it on. It's just so beautiful. But when I put it on, I want to leave it on.",
        "Ridge: Mm, I like the way you think.",
        "Brooke: [ Giggles ]",
        "Ridge: But you're right, because once you put it on, i have a lot of work to do. I got to design the dress, alert the media... why did you bring me here, brooke logan?",
        "Brooke: I think you brought me here.",
        "Ridge: Six of one.",
        "Brooke: What?",
        "Ridge: You are the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.",
        "Ridge: Wow.",
        "Brooke: [ Sighs ]",
        "Ridge: If there was ever any doubt that we were supposed to be together, then...",
        "Brooke: No, there isn'T.",
        "Ridge: Not after that. [ Sighs ] Mmm.",
        "Brooke: [ Giggles ]",
        "Ridge: There it is. That giggle -- I missed it.",
        "Brooke: Oh, you've always loved my laugh.",
        "Ridge: It's infectious.",
        "Brooke: Seriously?",
        "Ridge: Yeah. Life-affirming.",
        "Brooke: Now I know you're messing with me.",
        "Ridge: Mnh-mnh. I hear your laugh, and I know I'm gonna be okay. We're gonna be okay.",
        "Brooke: Yeah. We are.",
        "Ridge: This is where I want to be, right here. This is where we belong, right? And this? This is gonna be where it belongs -- on your finger. We have a future together. Forever. Me and my beautiful, one-of-a-kind logan.",
        "Brooke: Mm, mm, mm.",

        "Steffy: Yeah, come in. What are you doing here?",
        "Liam: Well, I mean, I said I'd wait for you. The nurse said it was okay, so...",
        "Steffy: You know this is just a check-up, right?",
        "Liam: No, I -- [ Sighs ] I know, and I know it sounds weird, but after everything that's happened, I just want you to know I'm here for you. Whenever, wherever, I'm here for you.",
