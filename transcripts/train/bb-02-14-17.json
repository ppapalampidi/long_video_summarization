        "Nicole is surrounded by Vivienne and Maya and her own hairstylist and makeup artists. Vivienne says she is stunning. The kitchen is a buzz with Pam and Charlie decorating the cake. Kristen and Tony arrive and are greeted by Eric. He tells them nothing is going to ruin this day for Nicole. Sally hugs Shirley for bringing in some cake; just what she needs to crash the wedding. Julius arrives and thanks Eric as this is the greatest thing he could have ever done by doing this for his baby daughter. Vivienne gives Nicole a boxed antique handkerchief that her mother gave her. Julius shocks Nicole but he says nothing would have stopped him from coming for this very important day. He is so proud of her. Ridge praises Quinn for being the gracious host. Sasha comes in and Zende tells her to relax. She says she wanted to show her love and support for both of them. Sally and Shirley manage to sneak in the open door as part of the catering team, complete with cakes.",
        "Eric catches Quinn looking a little too long at Nicole's portrait. He says she may have him wrapped around her little finger but he thinks he can still detect a little jealousy. Ridge sees them hugging and even Thomas tells him to stop staring. Sally brings the food in and she keeps looking at Thomas and remembers their kiss. Pam is just a little suspicious of Sally and Shirley as she was not informed they would be joining the team. Sasha tells Nicole she is gorgeous and then wants a little alone time with her to wish her the best. She tells her she is truly grateful that Nicole allowed her to be here. Steffy and Liam arrive. Zende and Carter tell Maya they are ready and good to go. Nicole tells Maya that she needs just a moment. She feels so blessed. Maya says now they need to get that dress on. Zende tells Rick that he cannot wait. Liam tells Steffy that it won't be long before they will see her walking down that aisle. The wedding march begins and Nicole descends the stairs. Her father awaits her with the bouquet and leads her to the altar. She sees the portrait and says Oh My God. Carter officiates and states it is so fitting on Valentine's Day."

        "Eric: Actually, Zende's responsible for that.",
        "Julius: Ah. Wow. On your wall, the same place that my other daughter used to reside. Oh, wait a minute. Are you and the lovely wife moving out and giving Nicole and Zende the estate? Is that what's happening?",

This exposure is gonna tie us to the Forresters and Steffy's followers. Just more eyeballs for our upcoming preview. I can see it now -- \"sally spectra crashes Forrester wedding.\"",
        "Vivienne: I'd like you to have this. Or at least borrow it.",
        "Nicole: Mom...",
        "Vivienne: Your grandmother gave it to me on my wedding day. Apparently, it's a day for tears.",

        "Zende: Hey.",
        "Sasha: Hi.",
        "Zende: Relax. Nicole invited you. Sister of the bride. Look, we can't get closer to family than that, right?",
        "Sasha: Yeah. Yes, you're right. Thank you. I really needed to hear that. Look, I just came today because I wanted to show my love and support for you two. Nic really is marrying... well, an incredible man.",
        "Zende: Thank you.",
        "Nicole: So, what do you think? Your baby girl's tying the knot.",
        "Julius: I couldn't be prouder. And what a setup! It must have cost a fortune.",
        "Nicole: [Laughs] Dad...",
        "Julius: I know. I know. When did you decide to grow up? I mean, I still see you as my little baby girl. You used to fit right here. All 7 pounds of you. With your little fingers wrapped around my thumb. Then you started walking and talking and...",
        "Nicole: And it all went downhill from there.",
        "[Both laugh]",
        "Julius: And you found a good man, too. But he better take good care of you.",
        "Nicole: He will. I'm so happy, daddy.",
        "Julius: This is your day, baby. All yours. And I want it to be the happiest day of your life. Come here.",
        "Eric: Shouldn't be long now.",
        "Quinn: Uh-huh.",
        "Eric: I'm curious about your fascination with this portrait.",
        "Quinn: It's lovely. Just like everybody says.",
        "Eric: Mm-hmm.",
        "Quinn: What?",
        "Eric: You may have me wrapped around your little finger, but I'm still pretty good at reading my wife, and I think I detect just a hint of jealousy.",
        "Quinn: What? Don't be silly. Okay, well, maybe you're not being silly. It's just, Eric, that is my spot. In this whole house, there's only one place that belongs to me and only me, and it's -- it's there. That could be a zillion- dollar Picasso, and I still wouldn't be very fond of it, and... I am being ridiculous and you need to ignore me.",
        "Eric: You know, there is one other place in this house that's yours alone. Right here.",
        "Quinn: [Gasps] I love you.",
        "Thomas: Dad. Hey. How you doing? Stop staring. She's the hostess. You have to be nice.",
        "Ridge: You're right, I'll have to try to rise above it.",
        "Shirley: [Sighs] Well, this sort of spits all over your perfect little plan, doesn't it? [Sighs] I have seen better cakes in a cow field.",
        "Sally: Well, life is what it throws at you, grams. Deal.",
        "Shirley: [Sighs] Honey... I didn't have enough time to make it presentable. And we don't even know if it's edible. We never got to taste it.",
        "Sally: To be continued! Here. Let's go mingle.",
        "Thomas: It's a little bit better than yours...",
        "Rick: I don't even recognize the living room.",
        "Carter: Zende did good.",
        "Rick: I'm good. Thank you.",
        "Thomas: Oh, watching your girly figures? You look cute.",
        "Carter: It's not a carb day. It's not a carb day.",
        "Thomas: Really?",
        "Rick: Look at all this other food we're gonna be eating.",
        "Carter: Yeah. Save some room.",
        "Charlie: All right, the cake is all done, and it's perfect. It's really great. The bird goes in the oven...",
        "Pam: I still wonder about those two.",
        "Charlie: Well, they're -- they're just backups, you know? Their coach probably called them in, in case they need more help. Pammy, you got enough to worry about.",
        "Pam: [Sighs]",
        "Julius: You just take care of my little girl, okay?",
        "Zende: Always and forever. Look, you have my word.",
        "Julius: Congratulations. Son.",
        "Nicole: You've been through this before.",
        "Steffy: Mm-hmm.",
        "Nicole: Any advice?",
        "Steffy: Just breathe.",
        "Nicole: [Sighs]",
        "Steffy: The bride is the star of the show.",
        "Nicole: Not used to that.",
        "Steffy: You're gonna look gorgeous, and so is the wedding, okay?",
        "Nicole: Okay.",
        "Steffy: I'm so happy for you. I really am so, so happy for you.",
        "Nicole: Thank you.",
        "Vivienne: All right, girlies. Come. Let's put that dress on.",
        "Steffy: Okay, so, just remember -- everyone loves you. Everyone in that room loves you.",
        "[Knocks on door]",
        "Sasha: Oh, wow. Nicole, you look gorgeous. Um, do you guys mind if I have a moment alone with my sister? I just want to wish her the best.",
        "Sasha: Nic, you look so beautiful.",
        "Nicole: Thank you.",
        "Sasha: I mean, no, I mean it. You look all...glowy.",
        "[Both chuckle]",
        "Nicole: Big moment to glow, I guess.",
        "Sasha: And you will. Nic, I am so happy for you. And I -- I am truly, truly grateful that you let me be here.",
        "Nicole: Sisters are forever. No matter what.",
        "Sasha: Zende's really a lucky guy.",

        "Carter: Why are you nervous?",
        "Zende: It's hot in here.",
        "Carter: I mean, she said yes, right?",
        "R.J.: Looks nervous.",
        "Ridge: A groom has a right to be.",
        "R.J.: You won't be when you and mom tie the knot, right?",
        "Ridge: No.",
        "Tony: I'm actually more nervous than I thought I would be.",
        "Vivienne: I feel like I'm about to faint.",
        "Kristen: Well, don't do that, but I know what you mean. I am so excited, I could burst!",
        "Vivienne: [Chuckles]",
        "Julius: There's a lot of that going around. My baby girl...",
        "Maya: Hello, hello. Are we all set? What are we chatting about?",

        "Nicole: Are you kidding? I'm so grateful for everything, everyone in my life. I feel so blessed.",
        "Maya: You are blessed. And so worthy. You deserve all of the good that life is going to give you. Now let's get that dress on so Zende can see how lucky he is! [Giggles]",
