        "Katie and Steffy press their ideas for the Summit on Ridge and he likes them and is sure his dad will too. Charlie tries to pry Pam to go out to lunch but she is still cold to him. She says she thought he was going to drop this about Quinn and he is still at it. Eric comes home and finds Quinn preparing a celebration. He says he is so lucky and she says no, he is her husband and she is the lucky one. Please let him never regret that he is married to her. He says he never will. She says she struggled all her life to make ends meet but just look at her now. He says he hated living in this house alone but she rang the doorbell and brought in all this fun and laughter. He cannot imagine living without her. Sheila sits at the restaurant and thinks about Eric. She soon asks Charlie if she can sit at his table for a moment. She senses he is down and asks if it has anything to do with Eric. Wyatt joins the group and Ridge fills him in on what they were just discussing. He'd like Katie to inform him of her idea. Katie presents a swimsuit showing but instead of a runway, use the backdrop of Monte Carlo. Wyatt says he likes it and he will have to run it past his dad but he cannot imagine him objecting. Katie has hit a homerun in her first try. Eric tells Quinn that he cannot stay as Katie is presenting her idea on swimsuits and he needs to be there. Charlie asks Sheila how she met the family but she keeps skirting the issue and says it seems like she has always known them. But she has spoken to people who have their concerns about Eric and that is all she wants is his happiness. She asks Charlie what he knows. He says not everyone dislikes Quinn. She and Ridge are certainly a-ok with each other. She laments if Charlie is implying more then she needs to know so she can be there for Eric.",
        "Alone Sheila thinks this over and wonders if it could be. She knows Eric and Ridge have shared a woman before but she cannot believe this. Katie thanks all of them for their vote of confidence and looks toward Wyatt who created the initial idea. Sheila shows up at Eric's door and pushes her way in. She is glad Eric is not there so she can be alone with Quinn. Wyatt tells Katie that she has great instincts. She says he has no idea how much this means to her. It makes her feel alive. She thanks him. Quinn asks Sheila what she can do for her. Sheila says it must mean a lot for her to have her portrait over the mantel. The conversation revolves around to Ridge and Sheila thinks that is very convenient, all of them under the same roof. Quinn corrects her that Ridge does not actually live in the house, just on the property. She announces that she and Eric are blissfully happy. She tells Sheila that she thinks the conversation is over. Sheila laments that she was taken down to the police station and thrown in jail. She has done things wrong in her past but she is sorry for every one of her misdeeds. She is sure Quinn is guilty of some wrongs too. She offers that she is no threat to Quinn. She cannot hurt her as Quinn has not done anything wrong."

        "Steffy: So, what do you think, Dad? Swimwear. Monte Carlo. I think it's a positive, charitable event.",
        "Ridge: Does it have to be the Spencer summit?",
        "Katie: Well, that's actually gonna save us a lot of money. Uh, putting an event like this together can take months, and the Spencer summit is already a hot international ticket, it's already booked, and there's the added benefit of working with Liam and Wyatt.",
        "Steffy: I like it.",
        "Ridge: I like it, too. And dad's gonna like it. Look at you. You've been here five minutes, you already have a winning concept.",
        "Katie: [Chuckles] Well, I forgot how much I enjoy collaborating.",
        "Steffy: Well, you've been busy with will. But now that he's at day camp, you can, you know, do you. And we have to make sure that Liam and Wyatt are on board.",
        "Katie: Well, I can't speak for Liam, but I have a feeling that Wyatt won't have any objection.",
        "Charlie: Ya know... how 'bout if I take the most beautiful woman in north America out to lunch?",
        "Pam: Not hungry.",
        "Charlie: Come on, Pammy. Don't be mad.",
        "Pam: I am not mad, Charlie. I just thought you were gonna drop this.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, well, I can't, Pammy. It's [Stammering]",
        "Pam: Charlie, look. You are floating some very dangerous ideas. Suspecting ridge and Quinn of being...involved!",
        "Charlie: Well, the truth is the light, especially for Eric.",
        "Pam: [Sighs] Well, I don't believe it. And neither will he. Ridge and Quinn would never betray him in that way, so just stop with your insinuations!",
        "Eric: Well, this is lovely. What's the celebration?",
        "Quinn: Well, I woke up this morning. And you're my husband.",
        "Eric: I am so lucky to have you as my wife.",
        "Quinn: No. No. I am the lucky one. I don't deserve you, and yet here you are. I promise never to make you regret loving me.",
        "Eric: You never could.",
        "[Glass clatters] Oh, I-I am so, so sorry!",
        "Sheila: You idiot! I apologize.",
        "Sheila: You almost got that all over me! I'm so sorry. I'll have someone clean this up right away. Can I offer you a glass of wine on the house? Uh, dessert, perhaps?",
        "Sheila: That's not necessary. Accidents do happen.",
        "Ridge: Ah, just in time. I trust your dad is not joining us?",
        "Wyatt: Uh, I could call him over if you like.",
        "Ridge: Ugh.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] No, uh, Liam had a meeting that ran over, but he said he'll be here later for the calendar shoot. Uh, my question is, is why are we all here?",
        "Ridge: Well, as you probably know, Katie is in charge of P.R. And marketing at Forrester.",
        "Wyatt: Yes. Yeah, I-I couldn't have made a better choice myself. I'm sure she's just throwing out fabulous ideas.",
        "Katie: [Chuckles]",
        "Ridge: Well, actually, she has a concept she wants to run past you.",
        "Wyatt: Really? Well, let's hear it. I'm sure it's intriguing.",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles]",
        "Eric: [Chuckles] What?",
        "Quinn: Oh! It's just... my life. In this beautiful home with my wonderful husband, drinking champagne, eating caviar, I... [Laughs] It's definitely not what my life used to be. I worked all the time, I struggled to make ends meet, but... Look at me now. You have changed every aspect of my life.",
        "Eric: I was empty, Quinn. I hated living in this house all alone. Then you rang the doorbell, and you... you brought in all that warmth and love and laughter. I can't imagine living my life without you.",
        "Quinn: You never have to.",
        "[Indistinct chatter]",
        "Charlie: Yeah, just iced tea.",
        "Sheila: Charlie. Hi. Do you mind if I join you for a moment?",
        "Charlie: Okay.",
        "Sheila: Are you okay? You seem to have something weighing heavy on your mind.",
        "Charlie: Well, you know, I, uh, think about things.",
        "Sheila: Sometimes it helps to talk to a stranger. No judgment or preconceived notions.",
        "Charlie: That would be refreshing. If I had anything to say.",
        "Sheila: [Chuckles] I'm sure you've got plenty to say. Head of security at Forrester creations? Probably know a little bit about everything going on over there.",
        "Charlie: Yeah, sometimes it's a curse.",
        "Sheila: This mood that you're in... does it have anything to do with Eric?",
        "Katie: Unveiling the swimwear line at the Spencer summit takes our clients on vacation. Instead of a showroom, we give them the beautiful backdrop of Monte Carlo. Steffy, I hope you'll model.",
        "Wyatt: I mean, it sounds like a tailor-made campaign for you, actually.",
        "Steffy: It almost sounds like this is something Wyatt would come up with.",
        "Ridge: What's the verdict? What do you say?",
        "Wyatt: Well, uh, partnering with Forrester for a-a new line while making it a charitable event always puts Spencer in a positive light. Makes dad look good. Liam gets to sleep at night. And we get a ton of exclusives with all the publications. I like it. I think it's a great idea. You've got my vote.",
        "Steffy: Great. Great.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. I-I do have to run it by dad, but I don't see a reason why he would object.",
        "Ridge: Excellent.",
        "Wyatt: Congratulations, Katie. Not many people hit a home run first time at bat.",
        "Katie: Well, you know, sometimes inspiration comes from where you least expect it.",
        "Wyatt: Ain't that the truth.",
        "Quinn: Mm. Mm. No.",
        "Eric: You make it a little difficult to tear myself away.",
        "Quinn: No, that's the idea. Do you really have to go?",
        "Eric: Yes. Conference call. Katie pitched launching the swimwear line in Monte Carlo, in conjunction with the Spencer summit.",
        "Quinn: Really?",
        "Eric: Yeah.",
        "Quinn: Hm.",
        "Eric: I knew she'd be great in marketing and P.R. She's terrific.",
        "Quinn: Yeah. Wow. Monte Carlo. That brings back memories.",
        "Eric: What, Monte Carlo?",
        "Quinn: Mm-hmm.",
        "Eric: Oh, yeah! Monte Carlo. Where you danced for me the first time.",
        "Quinn: Would you like for me to dance for you right now?",
        "Eric: I think I would. I love watching you move. Never gets old.",
        "Quinn: How 'bout like this?",
        "Eric: Uh...",
        "Quinn: Huh?",
        "Eric: No.",
        "Quinn: Like this?",
        "Eric: No, no, no.",
        "Quinn: This?",
        "Eric: Not like that.",
        "Quinn: No?",
        "Eric: Like this.",
        "Quinn: Ahh.",
        "[Both sigh happily]",
        "Eric: [Speaks indistinctly]",
        "Quinn: [Laughs] No!",
        "Sheila: You admitted it yourself -- you're an integral part of Forrester creations.",
        "Charlie: It's not like I'm a designer or anything.",
        "Sheila: [Chuckles] Designers are basically clueless when it comes to knowing a company's heartbeat. That takes feet on the ground to do that.",
        "Charlie: That's very perceptive of you. Not many people realize that.",
        "Sheila: You probably run the company. In your own subtle way, of course.",
        "Charlie: Well, you know, I like to keep my finger on the pulse of what's going on.",
        "Sheila: Yeah, my point exactly. That way you would know if anything were off.",
        "Charlie: You said you're a friend of the Forresters. Uh, how'd you meet them?",
        "Sheila: Wow. It was so long ago, I... it just seems like the Forresters have always been there, you know? Which is why I'm -- I'm concerned, Charlie, about Eric specifically, and I think you are, too. Is it his health?",
        "Charlie: He's in, uh... he's in great shape.",
        "Sheila: [Sighs] Yeah, of course. Of course. I'm sure Quinn has him taking very good care of himself. She is good for him?",
        "Charlie: It's -- it's none of my business.",
        "Sheila: It's just that I -- I've talked to... well, some people that -- that care about Eric, and it seems that there's some misgivings where Quinn is concerned. Not -- not that I would know. I don't really even know her. But I-I know she makes Eric -- or seems to make him -- very happy. And that's all I want, is -- is Eric's happiness. And if Quinn can do that... Charlie, what is it? Quinn seems lovely. It seems like nobody really likes her, though.",
        "Charlie: Not everyone dislikes her. I can tell you one person that likes Quinn just fine -- ridge. Quinn is a-okay with ridge.",
        "Sheila: I-I -- I don't understand. Are -- are you implying --",
        "Charlie: Nothing. Uh...you just assumed that no one likes Quinn, and I was just correcting that false assumption.",
        "Sheila: You know what, it's okay to tell me the truth. I care deeply for Eric. And if he needs a friend or help, I want to be there for him.",
        "Charlie: I got to go.",
        "[Indistinct chatter]",
        "Charlie: I can tell you one person that likes Quinn just fine -- ridge. [Echoing] Ridge. Ridge.",
        "Sheila: [Thinking] Strange. Almost like Charlie's suggesting... it can't be. Sure, Eric and ridge have shared a woman before... but his own stepmother? Oh, I can't believe it.",
        "Quinn: I don't want you to ever doubt how much I love you. Or my commitment to you. Those are both rock-solid. You are the only man for me.",
        "Ridge: What's the status of the calendar shoot?",
        "Steffy: Just a few last-minute details to sort out with the charity.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, and Liam just texted. He said he's on his way, and he's got Jarrett coming with an EPK crew for some behind-the-scenes footage and a live feed.",
        "Steffy: But we're meeting later today.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Katie: I think this photo shoot is the perfect teaser for our show in Monte Carlo.",
        "Ridge: I agree. Keep it up.",
        "Steffy: It's a good fit for you, Katie. Swimwear line in Monte Carlo? It was inspired.",
        "Ridge: And it just came to you?",
        "Katie: Yeah, something like that. Uh, thank you for the vote of confidence. It, um... it feels amazing.",
        "Wyatt: Uh, it's nothing less than you deserve.",
        "Ridge: We've been missing you around here. But now with Katie in charge, I get a feeling we're not gonna miss you anymore.",
        "[All chuckle]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Quinn: Uh, did you forget something [Singsong voice] My love? H-- oh. It's you.",
        "Sheila: Hello, Quinn. May I come in?",
        "Quinn: What are you still doing here? I thought you said you were leaving town?",
        "Sheila: I said, \"may I come in?\"",
        "Quinn: Eric is not here.",
        "Sheila: Good. Then we're all alone.",
        "Steffy: I'm glad you're on board, Liam. Hopefully your dad will be, too. I think Monte Carlo will be the perfect backdrop for the swimwear showing. Heh. Okay. Okay. I love you, too. I'll see you at the shoot. Bye. [Sighs]",
        "Wyatt: [Clears throat] You were great in there.",
        "Katie: [Scoffs] Well, I'm still getting my bearings. I haven't done P.R. In a long time.",
        "Wyatt: But you have great instincts. That's half the gig right there.",
        "Katie: I really can't thank you enough.",
        "Wyatt: Wh-- stop. For what? I suggested an event at the Spencer summit. You came up with the swimwear concept.",
        "Katie: I don't think you realize how much this means to me, having a job again and feeling like I'm contributing. It makes me feel vital. It makes me feel alive. And that's in no small part because of you. So thank you.",
        "Wyatt: It's my pleasure.",
        "Quinn: So. Sheila. What can I do for you?",
        "Sheila: Every time I walk into this house, I think how incredibly lovely it is. You're very lucky to be living here. You must be thrilled having your portrait above the mantel.",
        "Quinn: I don't really think it's a good idea for you to be here.",
        "Sheila: I don't think Eric would mind.",
        "Quinn: Perhaps. But I was thinking more about ridge.",
        "Sheila: Were you now?",
        "Quinn: Yes. He's not as forgiving as my husband.",
        "Jane: Why would that matter?",
        "Quinn: Well, because ridge lives on the property, and if he saw you here, he wouldn't be too happy.",
        "Sheila: That is fascinating. You, Eric, and ridge all under the same roof.",
        "Quinn: No. No, no, no. You misunderstood. Ridge lives in the guesthouse. Not in this house. And I don't want to have to call him, so I really think you should go.",
        "Jane: I don't understand the attitude. It's almost as though you see me as some kind of a threat.",
        "Quinn: [Scoffs] I wonder why.",
        "Jane: I have no idea.",
        "Quinn: Well, maybe because you're a psycho.",
        "Sheila: Oooh! [Chuckles] Ouch!",
        "Quinn: \"Ouch\"? My husband's ex-wife, who just got out of prison for doing all sorts of horrible things... [Scoffs]",
        "Sheila: Yes. I've made mistakes. Haven't you? I was awful. And I'm ashamed of everything. But that was in my past. Rest assured, I pose no threat to you or anyone else.",
        "Quinn: I still don't know why you are here.",
        "Sheila: You and Eric... you're happily married. Isn't that true?",
        "Quinn: Oh. Ah, let me guess. You've been talking to people. I mean, I guess people are always gonna talk about me. Yes, rest assured, Sheila, Eric and I are blissfully happy. Do you mind if I ask who it is you were talking to?",
        "Jane: That's not important.",
        "Quinn: Well, it is to me. I'd like to know who my friends are, as well as my enemies.",
        "Sheila: Well, I understand ridge qualifies.",
        "Quinn: Excuse me?",
        "Sheila: As a friend. You and ridge, you are friends.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] Why are you bringing ridge up again?",
        "Sheila: I'm just making conversation.",
        "Quinn: Yeah, well, I think this conversation's over.",
        "Sheila: Hey, might I remind you that I was falsely accused of trying to kill you? I was taken down to the -- the police station and thrown in jail. The least you can do is be nice to me.",
        "Quinn: So... that's where your threat is? Is that right? I mean, are you about to, what, falsely accuse me of something, Sheila?",
        "Sheila: [Scoffs] How could I do that? You haven't done anything wrong. Have you, Quinn?"
