        "Liam sits in Bill's office as Bill opens more welcome back gifts. Bill says they are just pouring in. Bill asks if he has the animal piece ready. Liam says it will be in a few days. Bill says no, it will be today. He doesn't want to be a hard-ass about it but he's leaving town in a few days and he wants to be sure he has time to read it. Liam says he will have it. He wants to know where Bill is going. Bill says about as far away from here as he can get. Liam doesn't understand since he just got his company back and Brooke, so why would he want to leave it all now. Bill says he is not going to be gone that long and besides he has Liam as his trusted VP. He hopes he can trust him. And as far as Brooke, he would not leave town without her. She is the one motivating this trip. She knows nothing about it so Liam has to keep this secret. Liam says his lips are sealed. Bill turns his laptop around and Liam sees it is Dubai. Liam is blown away and says it is one of those once in a lifetime trips. Bill says it is making memories. Brooke gave him his life back, all of it, so this is just his way to show her what she means to him. Liam says most guys would just have bought her flowers, but this is like only old Dollar Bill can. Bill says lucky for Brooke; he is not like most guys. He promised her the world and he's giving it to her. Brooke asks Hope if she has any updates in her personal life. Hope says she is still dating both Liam and Wyatt and it is good. She needs this time. Brooke tells her there is no need to rush if she has feelings for both. Hope says she does. She could see herself with either of them. So she has to be careful and make the right decision before she moves on with her life. She knows both guys are frustrated but they are trying to hide it as they both want a life with her. She's so lucky but she doesn't want to drag this on. Brooke tells her again just to take her time and get to know both of them better and then when she is ready to make her decision and settle down, she will be glad she gave it this time. There is no timetable. Hope says but people will talk and it's not fair to Wyatt or Liam. She does not want to put them through this much longer. Brooke says the guys are fine. She is sure it's not a problem for them to court her for a few weeks. Hope likes the old fashioned sound of that. She thinks she deserves to be courted. She thinks the guys see it as a challenge. Bill calls Brooke and says he has something to show her; he'd like her to come over as quickly as she can. Hope pretends to be upset as Brooke is canceling their luncheon. Brooke apologizes and says it sounds important. Hope says she has issues with Bill but look how happy he is making her mom. As long as he treats her like the most important person in this world and makes her feel good about herself then she will be thrilled. So go and be happy. Quinn yuks when she finds cat hair on Wyatt's shirt. She says at least it is proving he is spending time with Hope. He says Liam gained points when he took Hope to the animal shelter but he is getting points too. Play time with a kitten usually drives girls crazy. Quinn makes a face at cats. She tells Wyatt that when Hope picks him in the end, and he will, just make sure Liam gets custody of the cat. She says they have new pieces to show Hope and wonders if Wyatt has signed the order forms. No, he says, but he will do that right now. He hesitates and is not sure what name to put. She tells him to be proud and use his new name. She says good job, he is a full fledged Spencer now .. Liam may have thought he had an edge, but no more. Wyatt quips that yeah they are both Spencers and both like cats so it's a level playing field. But then you add in his charm and winning personality She laughs Hope's choice will be clear. Quinn misses Brooke on her way out when she wanted to show her the pieces for the new collection. Must be off to see Bill, ah young love. She tells Wyatt she doesn't want to get in the middle of that. Maybe he should just grab Hope and take off too. They could take a cue from Brooke and go frolic too. They can start downstairs and see the new pieces. Hope says okay, they will frolic. Wyatt whispers to his mom that she is not very subtle when it comes to matchmaking. She says she knows. When they leave, Hope's phone rings. Quinn hesitates only a moment and looks at it. It's Liam asking Hope to meet him in the steam room. She deletes it.",
        "Hope and Wyatt come back to get the phone. She says she missed nothing but she feels naked without it. He hears the word naked and says they can lock the door. Well at least he tried, they settle for a kiss. Liam calls out Hope's name as he enters the steam room and decides that he is a little early. Quinn sneaks around and puts the lead bar on the door and turns up the heat to 135 degrees. She smirks when Liam gets hot and pounds on the door trying to get someone's attention. Brooke arrives at Bill's and says it is good to see him back in his element working so hard. How will he ever thank her. He asks where has she been in the Middle East as he has only the most romantic trip of her life. She thought Monte Carlo was pretty spectacular so how could he top that. They were in front of the Prince's palace and on his fabulous yacht. He shows her the laptop with Abu Dhabi and Dubai. He pulls the jewel box out of his pocket and she opens it. She's surprised that he saved the ring. He says of course as he knew the day would come when she'd want it back on her finger. He tells her that she is the only woman that has ever accepted him completely .who he is, how he thinks and he hopes he is doing the same for her. So he planned this trip to make it official .who they are and what they mean to each other. It's time for them to move forward. She has given him back his life, his company, his son. All that is missing is her. He says so let them start this adventure together. Marry him and let them commit themselves to each other for the rest of their lives. She can't say yes fast enough. He kisses her, then takes the ring and puts it on her finger and kisses it. They kiss again."

        "Quinn: Yeah? Well, at least it proves you're spending time with hope.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. You know, Liam got points for adopting it, but I'm earning some points, too. Play time with a kitten -- most girls go crazy for that sort of thing. Girls like hope. I know. Okay. Fine. You know kittens like to play with shoelaces?",
        "Quinn: Yay. Cats.",
        "Wyatt: I was annoyed at Liam when he took her to the shelter. I mean, come on. He was trying to obviously manipulate her feelings. But she didn't buy into it. She said she was still going to date both of us equally.",
        "Quinn: Well, in the end when she picks you -- and she will -- make sure Liam gets custody of the cat.",

        "Wyatt: [Sighs]",

        "Quinn: And then hope's choice will be clear.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles]",
        "[Birds chirping]",
        "Brooke: You're doing the right thing.",
        "Hope: I hope so. I don't want to send mixed signals.",
        "Brooke: I doubt Liam and Wyatt are thinking that.",
        "Hope: Oh, they are. They're trying not to be frustrated. They're hiding it. But I can tell they are. They're -- they're both ready to start a life with me.",
        "Brooke: Well, good. That's great. There's two very wonderful guys fighting over you.",
        "Hope: [Chuckles] I'm so lucky! I know! I-I just -- I don't want to drag this on.",
        "Brooke: Honey, really, just take your time. Get to know each one of them as best as you can, and then when you do make that decision, when you're ready to settle down, you'll be happy you took that time to choose the right man.",
        "Liam: Uh, dad, you ju-- [Chuckles] You just got your job back. You're finally back together with Brooke. Why on earth would you leave town right now?",
        "Bill: Well, I'm not gonna be gone that long, and, uh, besides that, I have my trusted V.P. -- Well, wait a minute. Katie appointed you. Are you my trusted V.P.? Can I trust my own son?",
        "Liam: What? Are you kidding me right now? Yeah, of cour-- yes.",
        "Bill: As far as Brooke is concerned, you think I'd go out of town without her? She -- she's motivating the whole trip.",
        "Liam: Ah, okay. Where you taking her?",
        "Bill: She knows nothing about it. Can you keep a secret?",

        "Liam: The look on your face. What is that? You got something planned?",
        "Bill: Making memories. Brooke gave me my life back. All of it. My company, equal custody of my son. So this is just my way of showing her what that means to me. What she means to me.",
        "Liam: Like only dollar Bill Spencer can. You know, most guys would have just bought her flowers.",
        "Bill: Well, lucky for Brooke, I'm not most guys. I promised her the world, Liam. And I'm giving it to her.",

        "Brooke: There is no timetable.",
        "Hope: No, but... [Sighs] People will talk.",
        "Brooke: You really shouldn't worry about that.",
        "Hope: Well, it's not really fair to Liam or Wyatt anyway. I don't want to put them through this much longer.",
        "Brooke: Liam and Wyatt are fine. I'm sure it's not a problem for them to court you for a few weeks.",
        "Hope: [Chuckles] You make it sound so old-fashioned.",
        "Brooke: [Chuckles] Is that bad?",
        "Hope: No, no. I deserve to be courted.",
        "Brooke: Every woman does. So, do Liam and Wyatt know the position you're in, that you have feelings for both of them?",
        "Hope: Uh, Liam certainly does. He gets it, because he's been through it. Wyatt -- you know, he's -- he's trying to understand. I think they both see it as a challenge.",
        "Brooke: Sounds strange, but I think this pregnancy scare was a good thing.",
        "Hope: Someday I'll be ready for that. But I-I can't let that happen on a whim. That's not how I live my life.",
        "Brooke: Somehow I think your future's gonna be wonderful no matter who you choose.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",

        "Brooke: Well, it depends on how motivated I am.",
        "Bill: Well, get motivated. I've got something to show you.",
        "Brooke: Okay. I'm on my way.",
        "[Cell phone beeps]",
        "Hope: So, it sounds like you're canceling our lunch plans.",
        "Brooke: Oh, honey! Oh, no! I'm sorry! Is that all right?",
        "Hope: It's fine. It's okay. Of course.",
        "Brooke: Okay. I know you're not a huge fan of Bill Spencer.",
        "Hope: We have our issues. No question. But look how happy he makes you. You know, as long as he's treating you like the most important person in the world and he makes you feel good about yourself, then I'm thrilled.",
        "Brooke: He does.",
        "Hope: Good. Then go be happy. You deserve it.",

        "Hope: There it is.",
        "Wyatt: I told you it was in here.",
        "Hope: Oh, you were right. Just where I left it. Oh, it's fine. I didn't miss anything, though. It's weird how naked I feel without it.",
        "Wyatt: Naked? What? Right now? Okay. You know, we should probably lock the door, though.",
        "Hope: I feel like maybe you misheard what I said.",
        "Wyatt: Hmm. Did I?",
        "Hope: A little.",
        "Wyatt: I don't think so.",
        "Hope: Yep. Mm-hmm. [Both laugh] Cute, though.",

I'm gonna have Justin send you the contract, look it over. Any problems, get back to me directly. Yeah, thanks. It's good to be back. Look at you.",
        "Brooke: It's so great to see you like this, back in your element.",
        "Bill: Yeah. All thanks to you.",
        "Brooke: How are you ever going to repay me?",
        "Bill: Hmm.",
        "Brooke: [Laughs] Now, that's a good start.",

        "Wyatt: [Clears throat] Huh. I wonder where my mom went.",
        "Hope: I don't know. But I'm gonna text her, let her know how much I love her jewelry. They really compliment Caroline's designs.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, but she also has an eye for couples that should and shouldn't be together, too.",
        "Hope: She might be a little bit biased.",
        "Wyatt: Yes, yes. But we should probably do what she suggested.",
        "Hope: With the bracelets?",
        "Wyatt: No. [Chuckles] No. Let's get out of here. Let's go hit the beach. Let's go somewhere.",
        "Hope: Well, I have a meeting. Can we go after the meeting?",
        "Wyatt: Are you slotted in for some Liam time?",
        "Hope: No.",
        "Wyatt: Hmm?",
        "Hope: No, no. In fact, he -- he hasn't called me today. I'm kind of surprised he hasn't.",
        "Wyatt: Hmm.",
        "Hope: I don't know. He must be caught up in something.",
        "Wyatt: Poor guy. He must be sweating it out over some fashion article. Darn it. I guess that means you're stuck with me.",
        "Hope: Oh, no.",
        "Wyatt: No.",
        "Hope: [Chuckles]",
        "[Steam hissing]",
        "Liam: [Sighs] Got to be...a thermostat in here, right? Too much. Too hot.",
        "[Doorknob jiggling]",
        "Liam: H-hello? Is somebody out there? I think you locked me in here. Hello? Uh, hello! It's -- it's really hot in here! Hello?!",
        "Brooke: A trip? Now?",
        "Bill: Oh, not just any trip.",
        "Brooke: Oh, right. The most romantic trip of my life!",
        "Bill: You are being sarcastic. You don't believe me?",
        "Brooke: Yes, I believe you. I wouldn't expect anything less from dollar Bill Spencer. Just, I don't know how you're gonna top our last trip in Monte Carlo. We were there in front of the prince's palace and on your fabulous yacht.",
        "Bill: Yeah, those are some beautiful memories, aren't they?",
        "Brooke: Yeah.",

        "Bill: What do you think?",
        "Brooke: Bill. [Gasps] You saved the ring.",
        "Bill: Of course I saved it. I knew the day would come when you would want it back on your finger.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs]",
        "Bill: Brooke, you are the only woman who's ever accepted me completely, who I am, the way I think. I hope I'm doing the same for you.",
        "Brooke: You know you do.",
        "Bill: So why did I plan this trip? Because it's time to make it official -- who we are, what we an to each other, everything about us. It's time to move forward. You have given me back my life, my son, my company. All that's missing is you. So let's start this adventure together. Let's commit to each other for the rest of our lives. Marry me.",
