        "Michelle: Good morning.",
        "Tony: Well, I don't think so. You walked out on danny? Huh?",
        "Michelle: Everything is fine, okay?",
        "Tony: How can it be fine, michelle?",
        "Michelle: Because danny and i agreed that it was for the best. We even kissed when I was saying good-bye.",
        "Tony: Okay, do me a favor. Tell me... tell me what's so great about you two splitting up. I don't understand.",
        "Michelle: We're not splitting up, tony. We're just giving each other some space. It's actually perfect timing, while danny needs to raise money by selling the house.",
        "Tony: What? Michelle, as danny said, you guys would live there the rest of your lives. It's your dream house, michelle. Why would he sell it?",
        "Michelle: Dreams die, and you find new ones.",
        "Blake: What a terrific space.",
        "Mr. Crandall: Tear out that wall, it'd really be something.",
        "Blake: This is the living room. Hey.",
        "Danny: Everything going okay?",
        "Blake: Um, danny?",
        "Danny: Yeah?",
        "Blake: It might be a little easier if you weren't here when we show the place. I know how difficult it was for the people who sold ross and i their house.",
        "Danny: No, no. It's fine. I want to be here, you know, in case they have any questions or anything that... put that down!",
        "Alan: You really love this project, don't you?",
        "Phillip: I'm going to turn springfield into the city that it should be. How could I not love that? There's so many possibilities. Once we get company leveled, we can really get moving.",
        "Alan: So buzz has to give up his dream for you to realize yours. Is that it?",
        "Phillip: It's called progress. You taught me that, or don't you remember?",
        "Alan: Buzz has run that restaurant for many years, though, phillip.",
        "Phillip: Out with the old, in with the new. You taught me that, too.",
        "Alan: I also taught you not to take unnecessary risks, and i think until this project is under way, we should keep this model covered. I don't want any stockholders seeing it. It might start a fight.",
        "Olivia: Hi. It's a good thing I brought my gloves.",
        "Joey: Hey, lizzie. What's going on? I got your message. What's so important?",
        "Lizzie: (Laughs)",
        "Dinah: Wow, the coffee smells wonderful, especially after the brandy last night.",
        "Edmund: You could have borrowed a pair of my trousers as well.",
        "Dinah: Oh, edmund, I'm sorry. I... gosh, you've been so good to me, letting me stay here and all. I just assumed it was okay to wear one of your shirts.",
        "Edmund: Oh, yes. Yes, of course it is. I'm sorry. Here.",
        "Dinah: Thanks.",
        "Edmund: Oh, and I had valet service take care of these. You can... well, you can have them.",
        "Dinah: Thank you.",
        "Edmund: And I don't think i did you any great kindness. You didn't have much of a choice but to stay here, what with jeffrey o'neill threatening your life.",
        "Dinah: Yeah, he certainly scared me, that's for sure. How did you sleep last night? Okay?",
        "Edmund: No. Very badly, as a matter of fact.",
        "Dinah: Well, that's because you weren't with cassie. I understand.",
        "Edmund: That obvious, eh?",
        "Dinah: Well, to a woman, yes. You know, I realized last night that she is very lucky to have somebody like you.",
        "Edmund: I don't know if she'd agree with that, the way I acted yesterday.",
        "Dinah: Well, whatever you did, I'm sure you did it out of love. I can see that's the kind of person you are.",
        "Edmund: I do love cassie, very much.",
        "Dinah: Well, I certainly hope she appreciates it. Sometimes you don't know what you have until it's gone. (Telephone ringing) edmund? Would you like me to get the phone?",
        "Cassie: Edmund? Hello? (Sighs) I was afraid you'd still be mad at me. Look, I don't know what happened, okay? I'm sorry about last night. Just things got out of hand, and I just want to get past this. Nothing is more important than what we have together, edmund.",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, my neck. Coffee. I need coffee and a massage after a night like that.",
        "Cassie: I can only help you with coffee, okay?",
        "Jeffrey: Oh. Well, then I'll just help myself.",
        "Cassie: Edmund? Are you there?",
        "Dinah: It just rang.",
        "Edmund: Cassie?",
        "Cassie: Oh, it's so good to hear your voice. Look, I am so sorry about last night.",
        "Edmund: Oh, god, no. I'm the one who should be sorry, cassie.",
        "Cassie: No, no. Don't apologize, okay? I just... can you just tell me you love me, please?",
        "Edmund: I do love you. I do love nothing in the world so well as you. Um, are you still at reva's?",
        "Cassie: Actually, I'm at the farm.",
        "Edmund: What? Jeffrey o'neill said that wasn't safe with the imposter still at large. What do you...",
        "Cassie: Yeah, but you know what? I talked to jeffrey earlier this morning, and there's news.",
        "Edmund: Well, what? Tell me.",
        "Cassie: They got her. They got the imposter. She is in custody right now, and she's on her way to washington, D.C., To be sent back to europe.",
        "Edmund: They arrested her? Cassie, that's wonderful news! Well, do we have a name to go along with the lunatic?",
        "Cassie: No names. Not yet, no. We don't have any names.",
        "Edmund: Okay, where in washington are they holding her?",
        "Cassie: I'm not sure. I don't know. But jeffrey said that he would meet me here this morning so he could explain all the details.",
        "Edmund: When?",
        "Cassie: He should be here any... any minute. But I would like you to be here, too. Can you come?",
        "Edmund: Right. On my way.",
        "Dinah: So they caught the princess of darkness, huh?",
        "Edmund: Yes, they did, and it's terrific news.",
        "Dinah: I guess so.",
        "Edmund: Wait, dee, don't you understand? With this woman in custody, jeffrey will have no reason to stay in springfield or hover around cassie, which means he's out of her life and he's back in yours, if that's what you want.",
        "Dinah: Well, that's a big \"if.\"",
        "Cassie: What are you staring at?",
        "Jeffrey: (Chuckles) you didn't tell eddie boy the whole truth.",
        "Cassie: I told him the parts that count, all right?",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, did you now? (Chuckles) oh. Ow. I forgot what a night in the surveillance van can do to a neck.",
        "Cassie: It was a quiet night in the van, which means the imposter's accomplices are far away from here. Thank you.",
        "Jeffrey: That's not necessarily true, cassie. Just because the accomplices didn't show up last night doesn't mean that there aren't any accomplices. This is going to take some time, you know.",
        "Cassie: No. No, I want my life back, okay, jeffrey? I want this to be over.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, I want it to be over, too, but we have to be 100% sure that the danger has passed.",
        "Tammy: What danger?",
        "Lizzie: It's just that my friend katie in new york wanted me to come up for the weekend, and I wanted you to come with me.",
        "Joey: To new york?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah. We can have a blast. When was the last time you even went?",
        "Joey: Uh, let me think. Never. (Laughs)",
        "Lizzie: Well, you have to go, then. Come on, joey. It's new york. We can do anything. Like, meet nightclub owners and booking agents and record execs, too.",
        "Joey: Record execs. Are you serious?",
        "Lizzie: It just so happens my friend katie's family is really big in the music industry, and i think this could help your career. Maybe you could call it a business trip.",
        "Joey: Business, huh?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, but with a little fun, too.",
        "Joey: You'll keep bugging me till I say yes, won't you?",
        "Lizzie: Nonstop. (Laughs)",
        "Joey: Then I have to say yes. (Laughs) I want to go. But I first have to finish my work today, and I have to get paid, plus, lizzie, I have to square it all with my mom.",
        "Lizzie: But, joey, the flight leaves in, like, a couple hours.",
        "Joey: Okay. Well, then I'll just have to take a later flight and meet you there. If not, the trip is out.",
        "Lizzie: Okay, I guess I can arrange something for you to pick up the tickets at the airport. See you in the big apple.",
        "Olivia: My, my, phillip. What's going on?",
        "Phillip: Nothing. Alan and I were just discussing a special meeting that I'm holding for some select spaulding shareholders to discuss our corporate strategy before we actually put it into place.",
        "Alan: I think that's a good idea.",
        "Olivia: Well, you know, as major shareholders, bill and i will be very interested to hear how it will impact us.",
        "Phillip: No. I said select shareholders. That would leave you and bill out.",
        "Olivia: Hm.",
        "Danny: Oh, god, I'm so sorry. I did not mean to bark at you like that. It's just that some of these things are really important to me and valuable, and when you picked it up, I thought maybe you were going to drop it. I'm sorry.",
        "Blake: That's okay. We understand. We do. That's what makes this house so special. Everything is put in place just so with love, and cherished. And please, feel free to look around.",
        "Danny: It's just... it's weird for me, you know, having strangers poking around in the house that I bought for my wife and me, and peeking into our closets, sitting on the sofa that we used to curl up on. No, no, no! Please, please sit. Please. Please.",
        "Mrs. Crandall: It's a lovely house, but it's really not for us.",
        "Blake: Oh. Well, I'll tell you, you haven't seen the kitchen yet. It's fantastic. And the backyard is wonderful.",
        "Mr. Crandall: We wouldn't want to leave footprints in the grass. Come on, honey.",
        "Blake: So much for that sure thing.",
        "Danny: Yeah, sorry.",
        "Blake: Hey. You know, don't apologize to me. You're the one who said he was desperate to move this house.",
        "Danny: I am. I am. I need it sold yesterday.",
        "Blake: Well, do me a favor: Next time I show the house, lock yourself in the garage until i tell you it's okay to come out. All right?",
        "Tony: You'd sell your house?",
        "Michelle: Look, it's his house, okay? And this is mine now, right? And that's why I figured I'd stay here while he unloads the taj ma-santos.",
        "Tony: Okay, and when that happens, what?",
        "Michelle: Then he's going to find his own place, things will calm down, and we'll see where we stand.",
        "Tony: I don't know, michelle. It sounds kind of vague to me. Sorry.",
        "Michelle: I want to keep my options open, okay?",
        "Tony: That's exactly what scares me.",
        "Michelle: Tony, I'm just being honest. I mean, danny and I shouldn't kid each other. The wife, the one he shared all the memories with, she's not coming back anytime soon.",
        "Tony: Maybe not, no.",
        "Michelle: No. So it's best for danny and I to just start completely from scratch. And by the way, our permit got denied, thanks to danny and ross.",
        "Tony: Really?",
        "Michelle: Mm-hmm. Apparently, danny didn't like the idea of you and I working together, so he called upon the mayor-- A.K.A. My father's best friend-- and they decided what's best for me.",
        "Tony: Oh, that's okay. I'll take care of it.",
        "Michelle: How?",
        "Tony: I will tell you when I'm sure. All right? I will take care of it. I'll see you later.",
        "Michelle: But you just got here.",
        "Tony: Yeah, it's tony. That account in caymans, I need you to close it now. I need the cash.",
        "Edmund: This is good. This is good, because jeffrey o'neill will have no choice but to leave town, or admit he was staying here for cassie.",
        "Dinah: Well, good. I'm glad that some people's lives are working out.",
        "Edmund: Don't give up. And I have to shower, get dressed, and get back to the farm. Excuse me.",
        "Dinah: Edmund?",
        "Edmund: Hm?",
        "Dinah: Are you happy there?",
        "Edmund: Well, as far as I'm concerned, wherever cassie is, is home. The place was pretty dead the first time I saw it-- haunted by memories, I guess-- but I think cassie and I have effectively erased those.",
        "Dinah: What kind of memories?",
        "Edmund: A man cassie loved died there. That's the kind of loss you live with forever, I think.",
        "Dinah: I'm sure.",
        "Edmund: Yeah, well, excuse me. I'm going to get ready.",
        "Tammy: What is going on, mom?",
        "Jeffrey: Tammy, you realize that someone has been impersonating your mother, using her creditards and basically just stealing her identity, don't you?",
        "Tammy: In europe, right?",
        "Cassie: And she was here, too.",
        "Tammy: Here, like here here? In this house?",
        "Cassie: A few days ago, someone broke into the house, and they wanted me to make sure I knew they were here.",
        "Tammy: Oh, my god.",
        "Cassie: And it was her.",
        "Tammy: Well, who is she? Some kind of crazy person?",
        "Jeffrey: It's okay. It's okay, tammy. We caught her last night.",
        "Cassie: That's right. And she's on her way to D.C. Right now, and she's going to be sent back to europe.",
        "Tammy: So if you already caught her, then why did you say there's still danger? I mean, what are you doing here?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, I just... you know, I wanted to make sure that you and your mother were completely safe, that's all. There may be some accomplices out there.",
        "Tammy: Well, where's edmund?",
        "Joey: Hey, everybody. Everything okay?",
        "Cassie: Yeah. Yeah. Everything is fine. Whenever you want to get started in the barn this morning, that's fine, too.",
        "Joey: Oh. Well, when I'm done in the barn, is it okay if I take a few days off? It's for my music.",
        "Cassie: Yeah. Yeah, sure, you know. We'll miss you, right? All of us.",
        "Tammy: You missed all the excitement. That wacko who has been impersonating my mom? They caught her, here. It turns out she'd snuck into the house a few times.",
        "Joey: Wait. Was one of them a few days ago?",
        "Jeffrey: Why do you ask?",
        "Joey: I think I met her.",
        "Olivia: Do I have to remind you that bill and I together own a sizable piece of spaulding stock?",
        "Phillip: No, I'm well aware of it.",
        "Olivia: Well, I'm sure i don't have to tell you that to exclude me, as your shareholder, from a shareholder meeting will only cause a rift in a company that really needs to pull together at this time.",
        "Alan: Oh, now that's a good point, phillip.",
        "Phillip: Olivia, you and bill have started your own company now. What's the name of it? Slipshod?",
        "Olivia: (Laughs)",
        "Phillip: Slingshot! Slingshot, that's it.",
        "Olivia: You got it. There you go. Good memory.",
        "Phillip: Yeah. And, I mean, it's natural that you want to make your own mark and pursue your own interests, but let's just say for a second... let's say you were to come to this meeting, and there were things about my strategy that in some way mirrored something that you and bill wanted to do in your new slingshot company?",
        "Olivia: Yeah?",
        "Phillip: Well, see, that would be a conflict of interest for you, then, to go ahead and do that after a confidential spaulding briefing-- not to mention illegal. So you see, I'm just trying to spare you a potential headache.",
        "Lizzie: Hi, daddy!",
        "Phillip: How's my girl?",
        "Lizzie: Good. How are you?",
        "Phillip: Good. What?",
        "Lizzie: Okay, I'm going to new york, and I was wondering if I could borrow your platinum card maybe?",
        "Alan: Are you going to visit new york, or buy new york?",
        "Lizzie: Well, I mean, you never know. Just in case, right? Please.",
        "Phillip: Yes. You can take it.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, you're the best!",
        "Phillip: I want you to have fun.",
        "Lizzie: Thank you.",
        "Phillip: Okay.",
        "Lizzie: Bye.",
        "Alan: You are spoiling that child rotten.",
        "Phillip: (Laughs) no, I'm just teaching her about entitlement, that's all.",
        "Olivia: That's something she knows far too much about, trust me. I'm going to go get emma.",
        "Phillip: And take her where?",
        "Olivia: To the garden, if that's on the approved list.",
        "Phillip: Oh, yeah. Sure. I'll have lydia come out with you.",
        "Olivia: My daughter needs me, phillip. And no matter how many worlds you try to conquer, or how entitled you feel to dictate other people's lives, there is something more powerful out there than you, and that's biology. She and I have a connection, and that's a closeness you cannot, will not fight.",
        "Phillip: Why would I want to, when it's going to turn out to be so useful in the end?",
        "Michelle: (Sighs) oh, independence. It's an awesome thing. No one to answer to. No one to check in with. No one to tell you how to live your life.",
        "Danny: Don't worry, I will not be here the next time you want to show it.",
        "Blake: Too late.",
        "Danny: Why?",
        "Blake: A potential buyer just called. He's on his way over, with cash.",
        "Danny: Cash? Are you serious?",
        "Blake: Cash is always serious.",
        "Danny: Okay. I hate to sell this place, but if I can get top dollar right away, I can get on with my life.",
        "Blake: Well, that's a good thing.",
        "Danny: Who has that kind of cash around here?",
        "Tony: I don't need to see the place, blake. Just give me the contract and tell me where to sign.",
        "Lizzie: Coming up on \"guiding light\"...",
        "Jeffrey: What?",
        "Cassie: You're the expert. But from right here, that looks like a bullet hole.",
        "Danny: You cannot buy my house.",
        "Tony: Why not? Hm? Why not? You need the cash, I've got the cash. It's a perfect fit, danny. Oprah: Only 11 years old and wants a sex change?",
        "Danny: What is this, a joke?",
        "Tony: No, not at all. I've got every penny lined up, danny.",
        "Danny: You cannot buy my house.",
        "Tony: Why not? Hm? Why not? You need the cash; I've got the cash. I need a bigger place in this town; you've got it. It's a perfect fit, danny. All right?",
        "Danny: Tony...",
        "Blake: Should I...",
        "Tony: Yes.",
        "Blake: ...Start the paperwork?",
        "Danny: No.",
        "Tony: Yes, blake.",
        "Danny: Blake, don't you dare. I am not selling my house to you.",
        "Tony: Danny, listen to me. It's not like I'm going to buy it out from under you and put you on the street.",
        "Danny: Oh. Well, that's very comforting.",
        "Tony: You care about this place. You know that, I know that. All right? You want perfect strangers living in here? Is that what you want? It doesn't matter to you that me buying this place keeps the house in the family?",
        "Danny: (Scoffs) family.",
        "Tony: Look, danny, I know that michelle moved out, all right?",
        "Danny: You talked to her?",
        "Tony: Yes, I did. I saw her this morning at the lighthouse. We are partners.",
        "Danny: Right.",
        "Tony: Here's the way I see it. Okay, while michelle is living there, you can live here as long as you want. It's your place, too.",
        "Danny: Really? What, as a renter?",
        "Tony: Don't insult me, danny. I'm not going to change anything in this place. I'll leave everything the way it is, all right? And when you get a paying gig and you're back on your feet, and michelle is ready to move in with you again, I'll sell you the house back at market value. Everybody's happy. It's a good deal, right? (Telephone ringing)",
        "Danny: Hello?",
        "Michelle: Danny. Hey. Want to hear something strange?",
        "Danny: Go ahead. It couldn't be any stranger than what I've already heard today.",
        "Michelle: I can't seem to get you and robbie off my mind. Yeah, me, michelle with no memory. So how are you guys doing?",
        "Danny: We made it through the night.",
        "Michelle: Yeah, I know this is going to be a tough day for you, you know, with me taking off and you putting the house on the market.",
        "Danny: Actually, I found a buyer. We're closing the deal right now.",
        "Michelle: Really? Wow. Well, you should come over. We'll celebrate.",
        "Danny: What?",
        "Michelle: Come to the lighthouse. I want to show you the place, anyway. Oh, and bring some of robbie's toys. That way he'll have something to play with next time he comes over.",
        "Danny: Okay. Building blocks and champagne. Anything else?",
        "Michelle: Nope, just you. See you soon.",
        "Danny: Yeah, okay.",
        "Tony: So, we have a deal?",
        "Danny: Looks that way.",
        "Tony: We are family, danny. That's all that matters.",
        "Danny: I'll go tell blake.",
        "Tony: All right.",
        "Alan: What you consider entitlement may be another word for selfishness.",
        "Phillip: It worked for you, didn't it? Now, you know very well in your day, spauldings made their own rules, and everybody else fell in line or they got out of the game.",
        "Alan: Yeah. That was the golden age.",
        "Phillip: Yes. Wwell, we're about to head into another one, and this time it will be my children who reap the rewards.",
        "Alan: Ah, the inheritors of the empire.",
        "Phillip: That's right. And I could do a lot worse for them.",
        "Jeffrey: You know, and it doesn't matter, joey, if you saw her or not, because right now she's in a jail cell in dc.",
        "Cassie: It matters to me. This is a woman who walked into my house several times, as if it were hers.",
        "Tammy: Oh, that is so creepy.",
        "Cassie: What did she say?",
        "Joey: She said she was a realtor, elaine something.",
        "Cassie: What did she look like?",
        "Joey: I don't remember. She had... kind of like you, blonde hair, except she had a really tight ponytail.",
        "Tammy: Oh, that's freaky, too.",
        "Joey: She totally fooled me, because she knew the place so well.",
        "Cassie: She knew the place so well? So maybe she took something else besides the cloak.",
        "Jeffrey: Now, hang on.",
        "Tammy: Wait, wait, wait. Are you saying that she might have been in my room going through my stuff?",
        "Cassie: Who knows?",
        "Joey: Tammy, have you had breakfast yet?",
        "Tammy: No.",
        "Joey: No?",
        "Tammy: And I am so not hungry after hearing about all of this.",
        "Joey: Mrs. Winslow, is it okay if I bag my chores for today and spend the rest of the day with tammy, kind of took care of her?",
        "Cassie: That would be great, joey. Thank you. Thank you so much.",
        "Joey: Cool. Hey, do you want to go into town or something? Maybe to the park or someplace where I can just keep my eyes on you?",
        "Tammy: Yeah. Just let me freshen up.",
        "Joey: Okay, I'll be outside.",
        "Jeffrey: What are you doing? You know, you're wasting your time.",
        "Cassie: My time, my house.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay.",
        "Cassie: (Sighs)",
        "Jeffrey: What? What is it?",
        "Cassie: Why don't you tell me? You're the expert, but from right here, that looks like a bullet hole.",
        "Alan: Phillip, you could learn a thing or two from your daughter.",
        "Phillip: Oh?",
        "Alan: Yeah. When you were her age, you were much like she is. I mean, you were full of yourself, impulsive, a little bit reckless at times.",
        "Phillip: Those were the days.",
        "Alan: Yeah. You had friends like she does-- katie in new york.",
        "Phillip: I don't have time for friends. I have shareholders.",
        "Alan: Tell me something: How long has it been since you and rick had a beer together, huh? Caught up, huh?",
        "Phillip: I'm too busy to go and have beer.",
        "Alan: So, building an empire, I guess, for your company and family doesn't leave you much time for anything else, does it?",
        "Phillip: I think I've finally got my priorities straight.",
        "Alan: Look, don't get me wrong. I have never been more proud of you than I am right now for what you're doing to this great city, and for the company and for your family.",
        "Phillip: Yeah, but?",
        "Alan: I just hope you're not doing this because you're trying to make up for something that's missing in your life.",
        "Phillip: I don't see how that's possible, because there's nothing missing.",
        "Alan: I never thought I'd hear you say that.",
        "Phillip: Well, you know, i give you a lot of the credit for that. Think about all those years that I fought you and I judged you and I discounted the things that you believed in and what you stood for. Well, you were right, and I was wrong. Other people's rules and what they think doesn't matter. They're always going to hate us anyway. No, the only people that I care about, the only people that i feel like I have to please are all living under this roof: Spauldings.",
        "Olivia: Bill, it's olivia. Look, you have to meet me at J. Farley's bar right away. I know, but phillip has got something huge up his sleeve, okay? All right, I will call harley, but remember this: You and I are running the show. Got it?",
        "Blake: All that's left is to set the closing date.",
        "Tony: Do it as soon as possible, blake. I want this transition to go as smooth as can be.",
        "Blake: Oh, transition. More like a takeover.",
        "Tony: (Laughs) you know, blake, I know I'm not your favorite person on earth, but I suggest you keep your comments and your commissions to yourself, all right? Work for me.",
        "Blake: I just find it very interesting that this is so much more than buying a house for you, tony.",
        "Tony: I'm sure you do. What does that mean?",
        "Blake: You've taken danny's place as top santos, and now you've partnered with michelle, making her a key part of your life. And now you're buying up danny's pride and joy, the house he bought for michelle.",
        "Tony: Blake...",
        "Blake: Is that a coincidence? I don't think so.",
        "Tony: Hey, I did it for danny's sake, to keep this house in the family until they get back together. All right?",
        "Blake: If you say so.",
        "Tony: Go. Set the closing date.",
        "Blake: Okay.",
        "Tony: Good.",
        "Blake: You know, that's what's so great about cash. Everything's happened so fast. It makes it so convenient, don't you think?",
        "Tony: Yeah, and what does that mean? Hm?",
        "Blake: I'm just thinking if danny and michelle don't get back together again, you've got a ready-made house, perfect to woo some lucky girl, whoever she may be.",
        "Danny: Champagne.",
        "Michelle: Oh, cool. Thanks.",
        "Danny: Sure.",
        "Michelle: Come on in.",
        "Danny: Wow.",
        "Michelle: What's wrong?",
        "Danny: Nothing. Nothing. It'S... I'm just a little surprised, that's all. I was expecting to see the beginnings of a club, not A... not a home. But you've obviously been spending a lot of time here. You must like it.",
        "Michelle: Yep, I do. Oh, good. You brought robbie's toys. I can't wait for him to come over and play here.",
        "Danny: Why didn't you tell me?",
        "Michelle: Tell you what?",
        "Danny: You know, that the lighthouse meant so much to you? Because this was a special place for both of us, and I could have been a part of... but that was the point, right? To find a place of your own, to make it your own, by yourself, huh?",
        "Michelle: Yeah.",
        "Danny: Okay. Well...",
        "Michelle: I needed it to be my own thing, you know?",
        "Danny: All right, well, you're on your way. I can understand why you'd like it here.",
        "Michelle: So when do you have to move out of the house?",
        "Danny: Actually, I can stay as long as I want. But I was thinking that it would probably be best if I find a new place for me and robbie as soon as possible, somewhere that feels, you know, right for us. What?",
        "Michelle: Oh, it's just funny that now that we're apart, we finally have something in common.",
        "Cassie: That's definitely a bullet hole. What happened, jeffrey?",
        "Jeffrey: Too late. (Gunshot) don't worry, I'm going to have it fixed, okay?",
        "Cassie: A bullet was fired in my house and you're telling me not to worry? Why the gun? Did she have it? Did you? Did you both have guns? What happened here?",
        "Jeffrey: It wasn't a wild west shoot-out or anything like that. Take it easy, okay? There was a bit of a struggle, that's all.",
        "Cassie: You could have been killed.",
        "Jeffrey: Not really. I mean, you know, the odds were against it.",
        "Cassie: Thank god you're all right.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, you know, I'm fine except for the stiff neck, you know?",
        "Cassie: If anything would have happened to you, I would have never forgiven myself.",
        "Danny: Now that we're living in separate addresses, if I were to ask you to dinner tonight, would that be a bad thing? Would that be a good thing?",
        "Michelle: No, good. Yeah, good thing, definitely. Oh! Mee grob.",
        "Danny: Me what? Me who?",
        "Michelle: You know, that thai noodle-y, spicy fried thing. Oh, I totally could get into that right now.",
        "Danny: Really? It's not even lunchtime yet.",
        "Michelle: Yeah, well, tell that to my stomach. Have I always been into thai food?",
        "Danny: You know what? I will tell you at dinner. Deal?",
        "Michelle: All right.",
        "Danny: I will see you later.",
        "Blake: You've taken danny's place as top santos, and now you've partnered with michelle, making her a key part of your life. And now you're buying up danny's pride and joy, the house he bought for michelle.",
        "Tony: No. It's just the way things are. But I like things just like this. Yeah.",
        "Joey: So o'neill said that he watched the place last night, even after they caught her?",
        "Tammy: I think so, yeah.",
        "Joey: Tammy, it means that there still could be trouble.",
        "Tammy: Joey, you know, it's really sweet of you to worry, but I'm really feeling much better about all this already. I mean it. So if you'd rather go back to work instead of hanging out with me, I'd understand.",
        "Joey: No. There's nothing I'd rather do than be with you. I left something outside. I will be right back, okay? Lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: Hey, I was just thinking about you. Thanks for calling. Listen, there's been a change in plans.",
        "Joey: Yeah, same here.",
        "Lizzie: Well, what's wrong?",
        "Joey: Yeah. Um, I can't make it to new york.",
        "Lizzie: What? Why?",
        "Joey: Something came up, just some stuff I have to do around here. Sorry.",
        "Lizzie: Okay. Yeah, that's fine. I'll just... I'll hang out with the other kids here. It'll be fun.",
        "Joey: Great. So have fun.",
        "Tammy: Hey, joey?",
        "Joey: Uh, I've got to go.",
        "Lizzie: Bye. Yeah, you have fun, too, joey.",
        "Edmund: Tammy! You must be very relieved.",
        "Tammy: Yeah, I'm working on it.",
        "Edmund: Is your mother inside?",
        "Tammy: Yeah, with jeffrey.",
        "Edmund: Great. Great. Excuse me.",
        "Jeffrey: Hello, edmund.",
        "Edmund: Good morning.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, I guess it is, actually.",
        "Edmund: Mr. O'neill, i realize I haven't been the most gracious of men lately, but a fantastic piece of police work. Cassie told me what happened.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, thank you, edmund. I'm just, you know, doing my job.",
        "Edmund: And now that you have, I guess you'll be going back to washington, D.C. Nothing to hold you here, right?",
        "Jeffrey: Not a blessed thing.",
        "Cassie: Hi.",
        "Edmund: Hey.",
        "Cassie: Hey. I thought I heard your voice. So, can you believe they got her? I mean, they got her.",
        "Edmund: It's amazing. I was just congratulating mr. O'neill on a job well done.",
        "Cassie: Yeah. Things could have turned out so differently.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, but they didn't, so be happy and hug away.",
        "Edmund: My thoughts exactly.",
        "Cassie: All right. Well, you know, come inside, okay?",
        "Edmund: Great.",
        "Cassie: I guess this is it, then.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah. I've just got a few loose ends to tie up around here, and then I'll be heading to D.C. To make sure that our imposter doesn't bother you any more.",
        "Edmund: Have a safe trip, mr. O'neill.",
        "Jeffrey: Thank you.",
        "Cassie: Thanks again.",
        "Dinah: Springfield inn. Springfield inn. Let's see... springfield inn, thank you very much. Hi. Good afternoon. Yes, I'd like to make a reservation for my boss. O'neill. Mr. Jeffrey o'neill. Yeah. Yeah, a single room would be fine, as long as it's a king- sized bed for two. I think that's what mr. O'neill prefers. Yeah. Okay. O'neill. Thank you very much.",
        "Olivia: Next, on \"guiding light\"...",
        "Tony: Well, I... the house is mine now. I bought it from danny.",
        "Michelle: I guess danny was right. You really do want everything he has.",
        "Harley: I was looking for the spaulding legal counsel. Have you seen him?",
        "Gus: You're looking at him."
