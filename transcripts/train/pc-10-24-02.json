        "Rafe: Ok. All right, hold on. Hold on. Let me make sure you got this right. You're talking about Elizabeth Barrington, right? Yeah. Alison Barringtons mother? Ok, that's great. No, no. It's nothing, never mind. You did a good job. Yeah. Uh -- hold -- I -- I\u2019ll -- I\u2019ll talk to you later. Bye. ",
        "Alison: Hi. We're finally home. ",
        "Rafe: Where you been? ",
        "Alison: I didn't mean to make you worry or anything. We just got so caught up talking. ",
        "Elizabeth: It's my fault. ",
        "Rafe: Hello, Elizabeth. ",
        "Elizabeth: Hey, Rafe. ",
        "Alison: We really actually did have a very nice day today. We got to know each other a little bit better. ",
        "Elizabeth: And, Alison, that's meant the world to me. Thank you. I really appreciate that -- I mean that from the bottom of my heart. ",
        "Rafe: Well, I'm glad you had such a great day. ",
        "Elizabeth: It was extraordinary. ",
        "Rafe: Well, since you had such an extraordinary time, you wouldn't mind if Alison and I had a little alone time together? ",
        "Alison: Actually, I'm sorry. I asked her to stay. ",
        "Rafe: Stay? ",
        "Alison: Well, yeah. I thought maybe I could use a little bit of her help. You know, I just wanted to get things ready for tonight. Um -- Nana and the lawyer are coming over to read my father's will. ",
        "Elizabeth: I offered to help Alison get things ready tonight. ",
        "Alison: Yeah. ",
        "Rafe: Well, thanks, Elizabeth. That's considerate, but I think we can manage. ",
        "Alison: I actually would really appreciate her help. I wanted to make some of my Nana's favorite things, you know, so that it wasn't so cold in here tonight, so it just seemed a little bit warmer. ",
        "Elizabeth: And believe it or not, I actually know my way around a kitchen. ",
        "Alison: Yeah, you do. It won't take long, though, I promise. ",
        "Rafe: Alison \u2013 ",
        "Alison: Rafe, I promise, ok? I promise. Thank you. I was thinking maybe we could make some lemon tea cakes. ",
        "Elizabeth: Ah, that sounds perfect. ",
        "Alison: Ok, ok. ",
        "Rafe: Ahem. ",
        "~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~",
        "Jack: I'm not going crazy. Tess was there. She was in that cave. ",
        "Jamal: Jack? Jack, come on. We looked everywhere. We didn't find anything. We didn't find any -- any rag dolls, we didn't find any digital camera pictures or anything like that. We just found a bunch of junk. ",
        "Jack: I don't understand why you don't believe me that that was Tess' s stuff in that cave. ",
        "Jamal: Look, I could, or maybe things just didn't happen the way that you think they did. ",
        "Jack: No, they did. I'm telling you they did. ",
        "Jamal: Ok, so, so -- ok, fine. So one day you met a girl who lived in a cave that nurses you back to health who just happens to look exactly like Livvie, right? ",
        "Jack: You know what? I'm done arguing with you. ",
        "Jamal: Look, I'm just trying to understand, brother, that's it. ",
        "Jack: Well, you'll understand when Chris gets back and you see the x-rays that I had a broken leg two weeks ago. ",
        "Jamal: That she fixed? No cast, no splints, no crutches, no nothing -- and you just walked away? ",
        "Jack: Actually, she turned my arms into wings and I flew home. ",
        "Jamal: Come on, dude. This day is long enough already. Just chill out",
        ". ",
        "Chris: Well, we should have you out of here in no time. ",
        "Jamal: What's up, Chris? ",
        "Chris: Jamal. ",
        "Jamal: Hey. ",
        "Chris: Got your results back. It's good news. ",
        "Jack: So my leg's doing better? Is \u2013 ",
        "Chris: Yeah, you could say that, I guess. ",
        "Jack: Well, what? ",
        "Chris: Well, I checked and then I rechecked them, but your x-rays don't show anything. In fact, I can't find any evidence that you ever broke your leg at all. ",
        "~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~",
        "Tess: Brennan. Brennan. Better. Happily -- happily ever after. Better. ",

        "nurse: Knock, knock. Just doing my rounds. How are you feeling? ",
        "Livvie: Ok, I guess. I'd feel a lot better if Jack were here. ",
        "Nurse: I can understand that. Your boyfriend is really cute and sweet. ",
        "Livvie: Yeah, but it's not like him to keep me waiting like this. He knows how much I need him.",
        "Nurse: Well, you may not have to wait long. I just saw him down in x-ray a while ago. I'm sure he'll be up soon. ",
        "Livvie: Jack was in x-ray? All right. Something must've happened to him. Ow. Ow. That explains why he hasn't been here to see me. I wonder what happened. ",

        "Ricky: So, now that I\u2019m dead to Stephen Clay and his whole rocking experience, I might as well be dead to the whole world. Ugh. Good for nothing but drinking -- at least for tonight. ",
        "Marissa: Hey, Ricky. I've been looking all over for you, my favorite writing partner. ",
        "Rafe: Marissa -- Marissa? ",
        "Marissa: Ricky \u2013 ",
        "Ricky: Now's not a good time. ",
        "Marissa: No, dude, I am so in the zone, I can't -- I couldn't stop writing all night. You know, I used to think that being a reporter was a high, but this songwriting stuff? Man, this is a rush. ",
        "Ricky: Yeah, yeah, it's a rush -- like totally, it's such a rush. ",
        "Marissa: Exactly. It totally kills. So you know what? I can't wait for the band to see some of this new stuff, so we should go before \u2013 ",
        "Ricky: Well, you know what? You know -- whoa, whoa, whoa, stop. I'm going to pass. Hey, buddy, can you set me up with another one, man? ",
        "Marissa: Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Ricky, come on, let's go \u2013",
        " ",
        "Ricky: Marissa! ",
        "Marissa: I promise you'll have fun -- what? ",
        "Ricky: What part of \"no\" did you not understand? ",
        "Marissa: What's with this? ",
        "Ricky: I'm not in the band, ok? ",
        "Marissa: What are you talking about? ",
        "Ricky: They kicked me to the curb. I'm out. So run along and play rock star with somebody else. ",
        "~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~",
        "Jack: No, Chris, you got to recheck those x-rays, all right, because I know that I had a broken leg. ",
        "Chris: Not a chance, pal. ",
        "Jamal: Well, maybe you misread it and made a mistake or something. ",
        "Jack: Yeah. ",
        "Chris: No, I don't make mistakes. And it's nearly impossible to misread a fracture x-ray. I mean, even after a break is completely healed, a third-rate doctor is going to be able to tell where it was. ",
        "Jamal: So if there's no sign on the x-ray, then that means that \u2013 ",
        "Chris: Jack's leg was never broken. ",
        "Jack: No, no, no, that can't be. ",
        "Chris: You know, I don't understand what the big deal is. Most people, I tell them, you know, \"you don't have a broken leg,\" they're grateful and happy. What happened in the woods, you were eating those magic mushrooms or something? ",
        "Jack: Chris, this is not funny, all right? ",
        "Chris: It's kind of funny. ",
        "Jack: No, it's not funny. ",
        "Chris: Look, I'm going to go see some people who might actually need my golden touch, so excuse me. ",
        "Jamal: Later. Yo \u2013 ",
        "Jack: No, don't say a word, Jamal. Look, this was real, Tess was real, and I had a broken leg. ",
        "Jamal: I believe you. ",
        "Jack: You know, I don't even know why I bother with you. This is ridiculous. ",
        "Jamal: Dude, what is up with you, man? You've been hounding me all day about this. The second I say I believe you, you turn and walk away. ",
        "Jack: Ok, so you're telling me you believe me. ",
        "Jamal: As crazy as it sounds, yeah. ",
        "Jack: Why? ",
        "Jamal: Because I know that you don't have a good enough imagination to make up all this stuff on your own. So now what? ",
        "Jack: Well, we've got to find Tess fast. ",
        "Jamal: Whoa, you don't want to tell Chris the whole story and maybe he can run some other kind of test to find out what she really did to your leg or something? ",
        "Jack: No, no, no, I don't want to bring a lot of people in on this. I want to find out who she is and if she's connected to Livvie, so let's just keep it between me and you right now. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, yeah, that's cool. It's just \u2013 ",
        "Jack: What, what? What now? ",
        "Jamal: Well, what are you going to do about Livvie? ",
        "~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~",
        "Livvie: All right, Jack, you're not in x-ray. Come on, I got to find you. ",
        "~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~",
        "Tess: Jack. Find Jack. ",
        "Chris: Livvie? What are you doing out of bed? We told you that you needed to -- why are you dressed like this? And what's with the hair, hon? It looks like you threw it up in the air and ran under it. Listen, it's too early to be discharged, so why don't we get you back in bed, ok? Get some rest. ",
        "Tess: Jack \u2013 ",
        "Chris: Jack, yeah. I'll tell Jack you're looking for him. He's here in the hospital, but right now, I\u2019d really like you to get some rest and stay put, ok? ",
        "Tess: Better. Jack. ",
        "~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~",
        "Alison: Actually, these chocolate ones are my mother's recipe. ",
        "Rafe: Really? ",
        "Alison: Yeah. ",
        "Rafe: Hmm. ",
        "Elizabeth: You look surprised. ",
        "Rafe: It's just that you didn't strike me as the type to spend much time in the kitchen. ",
        "Alison: Rafe? ",
        "Elizabeth: Well, my future son-in-law obviously has a lot to learn about me. It may take a little time. ",
        "Rafe: Maybe not as much time as you think. ",
        "Alison: Hey. What's going on? ",
        "Elizabeth: I think it's my fault. Rafe obviously wanted to spend some time alone with you, but in all honesty, there is something very important that I need to discuss with you guys. ",
        "Alison: Look, look, look, wait, wait, wait, wait, please. I know this is a very crazy time for everyone. There's something very strange about the reading of a person's will. It's almost like a voice from the grave, and I'm just trying to make things a little bit easier on everybody, ok? ",
        "Rafe: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Elizabeth: Alison, I know that, but we have got to discuss something. ",
        "Alison: Well, I think we have a little time before everybody gets here. ",
        "Elizabeth: Alison, there's an issue with the will. ",
        "Alison: I don't \u2013 ",
        "Rafe: Finally. Go ahead, Elizabeth. Come on. Tell us about the will. ",
        "Elizabeth: I already know what's in the will. I read your father's will before he died. In it, he has left half of his estate to you and half of it to me. ",
        "Alison: I don't -- I\u2019m sorry. I really don't want to talk about this right now. I don't want to talk about my father's money -- please. ",
        "Elizabeth: No, Alison, there's \u2013 ",
        "Alison: Why don't we have something to eat. These are so good, so let's have a cookie or \u2013 ",
        "Rafe: No, hey, hey \u2013 ",
        "Alison: Talk about something really positive like our wedding. That's awesome. ",
        "Rafe: Let's just forget about this whole thing, all right? Let's postpone the reading of the will, all right? ",
        "Elizabeth: I think that's an excellent idea. I'll call your grandmother and invite her to dinner. ",
        "Alison: Wait. What \u2013 ",
        "Rafe: I just -- look \u2013 ",
        "Alison: What's going on here? ",
        "Rafe: You've already had such a big day, and I think it'd be good if you -- just come with me, ok? ",
        "Alison: No, I think we don't really have a lot of time because they're going to be here very soon. ",
        "Rafe: Just give me a second, would you? ",
        "[Knock on door] ",
        "Alison: No. They're already here. Ok? ",
        "Elizabeth: Wait. Don't answer that, Alison. ",
        "Alison: You guys, please? Hi. Um -- you must be here \u2013 ",
        "man: Here to see you \u2013 ",
        "Alison: Yeah. ",
        "Man: If you are Alison Barrington. ",
        "Alison: Yes, I am. Would you like to come in? ",
        "Man: That won't be necessary. Here you are. ",
        "Alison: Ok. Thank you. ",
        "Alison: I didn't think that she would come without her lawyer. ",
        "Elizabeth: Alison -- probably not a good idea to \u2013 ",
        "Alison: That's ok. We'll just -- we'll just read this now, I guess, just us and get all this legal mumbo-jumbo out of the way. Oh, my god. ",
        "Elizabeth: I'm sorry. ",
        "Alison: How could you do this to me? ",
        "~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~",
        "Marissa: Wait. What about that song that we wrote together? They loved that song. ",
        "Ricky: No, correction -- they loved your lyrics. ",
        "Marissa: But your music is what made the whole thing rock. ",
        "Ricky: Marissa, stop. You want to know what they thought about my music? They thought it was -- wait, what was that word that Joshua used? \"Pedestrian,\" yes. \"Pedestrian.\" ",
        "Marissa: They can't do that. ",
        "Ricky: Yeah. They just did. They never wanted me. They were just interested in you, ok? They could've saved us the hassle if they would've told us that from the beginning. ",
        "Marissa: No, Ricky, they're wrong, ok? They're wrong. All right? You are a good musician, a really good musician, and you know that. You know what? I'll just go over there and then make them give you another chance. ",
        "Ricky: No. You will not go beg them for me, all right? ",
        "Marissa: I'm not going to beg, Ricky, ok? I'm just going to tell them straight up, all right? If they don't have you, then they can't have me. ",
        "Ricky: Marissa, no. I'm not going to let you blow this, all right? You know how long people wait around for a chance like this? This is a chance of a lifetime, and you're going to go for it. ",
        "Marissa: Ricky, we're in this together. ",
        "Ricky: You have to do it, Marissa. ",
        "Marissa: No, it's the two \u2013 ",
        "Ricky: You listen to me. If you blow this because of me, I'm going to be so pissed, all right? I'm not going to let you walk. You cannot walk, Marissa. ",
        "Marissa: This is wack. Ok, this wasn't even my dream. It was yours. ",
        "Ricky: Yeah. You know what? It still is. I just -- I'll have to figure out another way of making it happen. Meantime, nature calls. ",
        "Marissa: So that's what these big shot musician people are like, huh? All right. They just haven't had to deal with me yet. And you know what, Ricky? They are not going to get away with this. ",
        "~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~",
        "Jamal: Livvie, she wants you back, my man, in a big, bad, ugly way, too. ",
        "Jack: Yeah. Yeah, I know. ",
        "Jamal: And she thinks that you're cool with all this? ",
        "Jack: Well, look, Jamal, I had to get her to the hospital or she would've died. ",
        "Jamal: So you lied to her. ",
        "Jack: No. I actually just didn't respond when she started saying how we belonged together and stuff. ",
        "Jamal: Oh, oh. You're in pretty deep, my man. ",
        "Jack: Yeah. Yeah, well, I really need to go talk to her and set her straight. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, well, good luck because I don't want to be anywhere in the vicinity when you're handling your business. ",
        "Jack: Yeah. ",
        "Jamal: Hey, call me up later if you want to go, you know, locate this Tess chick. ",
        "Jack: All right. See you. ",

        "Tess: Jack. Like before. Happily ever after. Be all right. Better. Find Jack. ",

        "Chris: Livvie \u2013 ",
        "Livvie: Have you seen Jack anywhere? ",
        "Chris: How many times do I have to tell you to stay in bed? ",
        "Livvie: What are you talking about? ",
        "Chris: Look, when I see Jack, I will tell him to head your way, ok? Until then, go. ",
        "Livvie: Hey, no, no, no, no, look. Can you stop playing doctor for one second and just answer my question? Is Jack here or not? I heard he was in x-ray and I just want to know if he was hurt or something.",
        "Chris: No, he's fine. He's fine, so please, just get back to bed, ok? I have to get these down to the lab. ",
        "Livvie: No, Chris \u2013 ",
        "Chris: Livvie, you heard me. Go. ",
        "Livvie: Fine. You don't want to help me, I'll help myself. The files have got to be around here somewhere. And when I find them, I will -- now what? God, that was such a weird feeling. Where is that coming from? ",
        "~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~",
        "Alison: How could you this to me? ",
        "Rafe: I just found out. That's what I was trying to tell you before. ",
        "Alison: This is the only reason why you came here, isn't it? ",
        "Elizabeth: No, just let me explain. ",
        "Alison: Explain what? It is all right here in the paper! God, you're contesting my father's will? You want to steal my inheritance? You not only want your money that he left to you, you want the money that he left to me, too? ",
        "Elizabeth: Alison \u2013 ",
        "Alison: I thought that you wanted to know me -- that's what you said. You said you wanted to be the mother that you never were. How could I be so stupid? ",
        "Elizabeth: Oh, come on, please, just \u2013 ",
        "Alison: This is the only reason why you came back here -- it is to steal this inheritance. God. You make me sick. This is the only reason why you came back here, isn't it? ",
        "Isn't it? ",

        "Jamal: What's going on, my man? ",
        "Ricky: Hey, man, what's up, man? ",
        "Jamal: What's up with you? ",
        "Ricky: Nothing, man. Long story short -- no Stephen Clay, no experience, not for Ricky. They kicked me to the curb. ",
        "Jamal: Ah, dude -- oh, my -- are you kidding me? What about Marissa? Where is she \u2013 ",
        "Ricky: Oh, no, no, no. No, they love Marissa. They want her bad. ",
        "Jamal: Ok, dude, just -- just chill out, ok, because, you know, I got a bad feeling about this band anyway. ",
        "Ricky: They love her. I mean, they'll do anything for her, whatever she wants. ",
        "Jamal: That's exactly what I\u2019m afraid of, too. ",
        "Ricky: You want me to tell you straight up what they said to me? ",

Ricky is a great musician, he is a great guy, and he did not deserve to be blown off like that.
