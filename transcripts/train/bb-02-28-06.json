        "Brooke: \r\nBy the end of the day, I'll be Mrs. Ridge Forrester. Again.\n\r\nHope: Mommy!\n\r\nBrooke: Hey, honey. Come here. Up on the bed.\n\r\nHope: It's so fancy downstairs.\n\r\nBrooke: I told you, we're having a wedding today.\n\r\nHope: Will Uncle Nick be there?\n\r\nBrooke: No.\n\r\nHope: Do I have to go?\n\r\nBrooke: I know you love Uncle Nick. I do, too. But he can't be here all the \r\ntime.\n\r\nHope: Why not?\n\r\nBrooke: Because he has his own life.\n\r\nHope: I wish you were marrying Uncle Nick.\n\r\nBrooke: You love Ridge, too.\n\r\nHope: I know, but I still wish you were marrying Uncle Nick.\n\r\nBrooke: Hey, we really want you to be our flower girl today.\n\r\nHope: But I have school.\n\r\nBrooke: It's okay, you can miss school for one day.\n\r\nHope: But I want to go to school.\n\r\nBrooke: Okay. Why don't you have Catherine help you get ready, okay? Sweetie, \r\nUncle Nick will already be in our hearts. He'll be right here. And right here. \r\nWe can't always have what we want. Everything's going to be perfect. I promise \r\nyou. Just perfect. Come here.\n\r\n-------------------------------------\n\r\nEric: Ridge, good, you're here. I want to see you for a minute.\n\r\nRidge: What's up?\n\r\nEric: Listen, this thing is happening very very quickly.\n\r\nRidge: This wedding has waited long enough, Dad. \n\r\nEric: I know you're ready for it. But is Brooke?\n\r\nIf you're worried about Nick, he couldn't be further from her mind.\n\r\nEric: Are you sure?\n\r\nRidge: Absolutely positive. She's as committed to this as I am.\n\r\n--------------------------------------\n\r\nStephanie: I want to talk to you.\n\r\nBrooke: You mean talk me out of marrying your son.\n\r\nStephanie: If it's possible.\n\r\nBrooke: It's not.\n\r\nStephanie: Then answer me one question.\n\r\nBrooke: One question.\n\r\nStephanie: Are you absolutely sure that you want to spend the rest of your life \r\nwith my son?\n\r\nBrooke: Yes.\n\r\nStephanie: But Nick is free.\n\r\nBrooke: Nick is devastated. He just lost his child. And then he finds out that \r\nDominick isn't even his son. He's hurting, Stephanie.\n\r\nStephanie: You could be there to comfort him.\n\r\nBrooke: Oh my God. I can't even believe you're encouraging me to go after my \r\ndaughter's husband now, when she needs him the most.\n\r\nStephanie: What she needs the most is honesty. Brooke, you married Eric. It \r\ndidn't take away your feelings for Nick. You marry Ridge, that's not going to \r\ntake away what you feel for --\n\r\nBrooke: That's it. I don't want to hear one more word.\n\r\nRidge: Neither do I.\n\r\nStephanie: Ridge.\n\r\nRidge: Why won't you leave her alone?\n\r\nStephanie: Will you at least please talk to Nick?\n\r\nBrooke: No. Nick and Bridget are committed to each other. They're happily \r\nmarried and nothing is going to change that.\n\r\n----------------------------------\n\r\nNick: Morning. How are you?\n\r\nBridget: I'm okay.\n\r\nNick: How'd you sleep?\n\r\nBridget: Didn't really. I was up most the night thinking.\n\r\nNick: Me, too.\n\r\nBridget: And?\n\r\nNick: And you're my wife and I love you.\n\r\nBridget: I never questioned your love for me.\n\r\nNick: Well, then what is it? Is it your love for me?\n\r\nBridget: No. No, I love you more now than I probably ever have.\n\r\nNick: Well, then what are we doing?\n\r\nBridget: We're discussing our future.\n\r\nNick: Good. Good, let's do that.\n\r\nBridget: Nick, we're always going to be a part of each other's lives. We're just \r\nnot going to be husband and wife.\n\r\nNick: So you haven't changed your mind.\n\r\nBridget: Have you? I'm sorry, Nick, I cannot go on with this marriage. Not when \r\nyou won't try to be a father to Dominick. Not when I know you're in love with my \r\nmother.\n\r\n---------------------------------------\n\r\n[Doorbell rings]\n\r\nEric: Reverend, there you are. Hi. Come in, come in.\n\r\nDarla: So is Bridget upstairs helping Brooke get ready?\n\r\nJackie: I don't think she's feeling up to it.\n\r\nThorne: I thought she and Nick were doing better.\n\r\nJackie: Unfortunately, they got more bad news last night. Now's not the time to \r\nactually --\n\r\nMassimo: Jacqueline, if something's going on with our son, I would like to know.\n\r\nJackie: I knew I shouldn't have brought it up.\n\r\nMassimo: But you did.\n\r\nAll right. If you must know -- Dominick isn't Nick's son.\n\r\n[Massimo sighs and clears throat]\n\r\n------------------------------------------\n\r\nBrooke: This tragedy is not going to derail Nick and Bridget's marriage.\n\r\nRidge: This is not about Nick and Bridget.\n\r\nStephanie: You're so right. It's all about Nick and Brooke.\n\r\nRidge: Oh, will you stop? Look, this is our wedding day, Mother. If you can't \r\nsupport it, then get the hell outta here.\n\r\nBrooke: [Sighs] God. Maybe we should have eloped.\n\r\nRidge: Yeah, I'm inclined to agree. But we've been there and done that.\n\r\nBrooke: It's not so much your mom, it's also what Bridget's been going through, \r\nand Felicia.\n\r\nRidge: I feel like everyone could use a little something to celebrate right now. \r\nAre we still on?\n\r\nBrooke: Yes.\n\r\nRidge: I will never disappoint you, Logan. I will never ever take you for \r\ngranted again. I did that once, assuming you'd always be there for me. It scared \r\nthe hell out of me to find out just how wrong I was. I know your love died -- \r\nyour love for me died when I left you and Hope and R.J. I had to earn it back. \r\nNow that I've done that, it means more to me than it ever has. I love you so \r\nmuch.\n\r\nBrooke: I love you, too.\n\r\nRidge: Nothing and nobody is going to get in the way of our happiness today.\n\r\nBrooke: Nope. \n\r\nRidge: Nope.\n\r\nBrooke: Nobody.\n\r\nRidge: I'll see you downstairs.\n\r\nBrooke: My makeup.\n\r\n[Brooke giggles]\n\r\n-------------------------------------\n\r\nNick: Bridget? I'm not doing this. I want to save this marriage.\n\r\nBridget: I love you for that, but I know when something is past saving.\n\r\nNick: Oh, please. I mean, my God, give us a break. I mean, we have been going \r\nthrough some hard times, don't you agree?\n\r\nBridget: But we've been going through hard times for a while.\n\r\nNick: That is not true.\n\r\nBridget: Nick, I'm just seeing things from a whole different perspective. Losing \r\nNicole and finding out that Dominick wasn't your son made me realize that you \r\ncan't freeze life in one perfect place. It's always going to change. No matter \r\nhow bad or how good things are, life is going to change. If we really want to be \r\nhappy, we just have to accept that. Accept things the way they really are and \r\ntry to go on from there.\n\r\nNick: And we can go on from there. I agree with you. We can have another child.\n\r\nThat's not the answer.\n\r\nNick: Well, neither is giving up.\n\r\nBridget: I'm not giving up anything. I don't have to stop loving Dominick just \r\nbecause he's not your son. And, I can love you and still let you go.\n\r\nNick: Let me go? Because I wont' be a father to Dominick.\n\r\nBridget: I do understand why you won't. I think it's a shame because I know that \r\nyou would be an incredible father.\n\r\nNick: And I want that. I want to be a father.\n\r\nBridget: And you will be. To Hope. You can raise Hope and R.J. with my mother. \r\nYou can go and make a life with them starting today. It's okay.\n\r\n-----------------------------\n\r\nMassimo: Let me get this straight.\u00a0 Dante Damiano is the father? ",
        "Jackie: It appears that he \r\nand Felicia spent a very brief time together in nice. ",
        "Sally: So brief that fifi \r\nFelicia forgot all about it? ",
        "Jackie: Well, I don't know \r\nall the particulars. And to be quite honest, I don't think they matter. \n",
        "Massimo: Does Eric know?\r\n",
        "Jackie: No, he doesn't. I \r\ndon't think he does. And now's not the time to bring it up. ",
        "Thorne: The last thing \r\nthat Brooke and Ridge need today is another family crisis. ",
        "Massimo: Would you excuse \r\nus for a moment? When were you going to tell me this? ",
        "Jackie: I'm sorry. I was \r\njust more concerned about our son then keeping you in the loop. ",
        "Massimo: Never mind the \r\nloop. How is he? ",
        "Jackie: He's devastated. \r\nSo is Bridget. I don't know how much more these two can take. ",
        "Stephanie: So you've heard \r\nabout Dante? ",
        "Massimo: Mm-hmm. \nFirst, Nicole. Now, this. The \r\nwhole damn thing is preposterous. ",
        "Stephanie: Yes, I was just \r\nabout to say the same thing about the wedding. ",
        "Ridge: Jackie, would you \r\nbe so kind to go upstairs? Brooke could use your help getting dressed. \n",
        "Jackie: Me? What about \r\nBridget? ",
        "Ridge: Well, I hope she \r\ngets here soon, because we want to begin ASAP. ",
        "Stephanie: You mean right \r\nnow? ",
        "Ridge: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Eric: What's going on?\r\n",
        "Ridge: Dad, would you get \r\neverybody in their seats? Brooke and I want to start this right now. ",
        "Bridget: Someone left you \r\na message. Shouldn't you get it? ",
        "Nick: You're the one I \r\nwant to talk to. Because I made a commitment to you, Bridget. ",
        "Bridget: But Nick, we knew \r\nyou loved my mother before we ever got into this relationship. We both went into \r\nthis knowing that. ",
        "Nick: But we dealt with \r\nthat. ",
        "Bridget: I still had \r\nconcerns. And then I got pregnant. ",
        "Nick: But we have been \r\nover this time -- ",
        "Bridget: Nick, stop! \r\nListen to me. I just want you to be happy. You sacrificed your happiness so that \r\nyou could make a life with me and our baby. ",
        "Nick: It wasn't a \r\nsacrifice. ",
        "Bridget: Well -- you love \r\nher. ",
        "Nick: No. No! ",
        "Bridget: Nick, you love \r\nher and it's o -- it's okay. Do you hear me? It's okay. You don't have to hide \r\nyour feelings anymore. Not from me. Not from yourself. Not anymore. ",
        "\r\n--------------------------------------------------------",
        "Jackie: The bride is \r\nready. ",
        "Eric: Is Bridget here?\r\n",
        "Jackie: She may not be \r\ncoming. And Brooke said that she really wants to get started, too. ",
        "Stephanie: Oh, but we \r\nshould wait. ",
        "Eric: Stephanie, this \r\nwedding's going to happen. ",
        "Stephanie: Why is \r\neverybody rushing so? ",
        "Jackie: I hate to agree. I \r\nmean, this does seem a little bit rushed. ",
        "Stephanie: Look, this is \r\nsupposed to be the happiest day of Brooke's life, and I get the feeling all she \r\nwants to do is get it over with. Doesn't that concern anyone? ",
        "[Phone rings] Oh, I have \r\nto take this. ",
        "Eric: Stephanie, the \r\nwedding is about to start. ",
        "Stephanie: Yes, hello? \r\nYes, this is she. ",
        "Eric: Look, what could \r\npossibly be more important than Ridge marrying Brooke? ",
        "Stephanie: Shh! \n",
        "Minister: Everyone, we're \r\nabout ready to begin. If you'd take your seats, and please, turn off your cell \r\nphones. ",
        "Stephanie: Yes, is there \r\nnews? Oh, I see. Well, I want to hear everything, but I really can't talk to you \r\nright now. I'm at a wedding. I'll have to call you back. ",
        "Eric: Stephanie, hang up, \r\nwill you please? You and I have to sit down. ",
        "Stephanie: Yes, good-bye, \r\nthank you. Why are you in such a rush to have Ridge make the same mistake you \r\ndid by marrying her? ",
        "Eric: Look, if you don't \r\n-- if you don't stop talking like this, I'm going to kick you out of here \r\nmyself. No one's going to disrupt this wedding. ",
        "\r\n----------------------------------------------------",
        "Nick: So you're ending our \r\nmarriage? ",
        "Bridget: Nick, I will \r\nalways, always cherish the times that we had together. ",
        "[Nick scoffs] All the \r\nsupport that you gave me. It was exactly what I needed. And now, I'm giving you \r\nwhat you need. A life with my mother. I want you to be with her. ",
        "Nick: It'll never happen. \r\nShe will never betray you, Bridget. ",
        "Bridget: Well, it's not a \r\nbetrayal if I let you go. This isn't a test, Nick. I'm completely serious. I \r\njust really -- I really want you to be happy. ",
        "Nick: I don't know what to \r\nsay. ",
        "Bridget: Whatever you have \r\nto say, you should go say it to my mother. Before the wedding. ",
        "Nick: What wedding? \n",
        "Bridget: Hers. She's \r\nmarrying Ridge -- today. ",
        "Nick: She's marrying \r\nForrester? ",
        "Bridget: Today. It's true. \r\nStephanie told me, and my mom left me a message. By the end of the day, she'll \r\nbe Mrs. Ridge Forrester. Unless you stop her. Nick, I -- I want you to stop the \r\nwedding. "
