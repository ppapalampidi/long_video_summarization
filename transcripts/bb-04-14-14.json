        "Hope returns and both Wyatt and Liam are there and Liam asks if she is pregnant. Wyatt is ticked. He tells Liam he doesn't want him here. This is private between him and Hope. This is not even close to being Liam's business. Liam says he is dying here. Just tell him and he will leave. Hope tells them both to settle down. A lot has happened these last couple of months. She and Wyatt have gotten very close. They are in a relationship but they are not going to have a baby. Liam says thank God and double pumps his fists. Wyatt is somber and surprised. Wyatt asks if Hope is okay. She says yeah. He says if she is then he's good too. She says this is probably for the best. Surprisingly Liam says he is gonna leave them alone to talk, but this is the best news he has heard in a long time. Wyatt says this is none of his business and nobody cares what he thinks. Liam says he loves this woman and he is relieved for her. This was a close call and would have changed everything. Wyatt tells Hope that they need to talk alone so perhaps when they hitch up the trailer and get on the road. Wyatt tells Hope that he is shocked that Liam just left. He was expecting his typical self-righteousness that he'd tear into Wyatt and give him a lecture and make a play for Hope. Bill and Brooke make love and she is glad to have her stallion back 24/7, morning, noon and night. He says do not think for a minute that he doesn't know how lucky he is to be back home with her. She wishes she could stay in bed with him all day. Instead he quips she has to leave Mr. Unemployed here at home alone while she goes to work. He says he wants Will back and now that Katie has Ridge maybe she will be more agreeable .to Will and his company. Wyatt and Hope agree they are lucky as neither were ready for this commitment just yet .. a lesson learned. She says they just have to be more careful about protection. He agrees and assures her that he would have been okay with it if she had been pregnant and supported her. She thanks him for being so sweet and understanding. He says for the record there is no other woman he'd rather have a kid with. But they have plenty of time in their future to have a ton of kids. He thinks they should just get out of here and on the Silver Beast ..they can talk, discuss their future, make a bonfire, camp out under the stars. She thinks another road trip sounds good.",
        "Katie shows up at Eric's office and asks if he has a minute for her. She gets right to the point, him making Ridge and Brooke co-VP's and how wise is that. She reminds Eric that she and Ridge are a couple now and how he might feel about that .. knowing that he must want Brooke and Ridge back together. Eric says he likes Katie. She's a terrific woman and he's always respected her but this is a surprise .but he thinks that Brooke and Ridge belong together. Ridge is the only man for Brooke. Katie thinks Eric is ignoring the obvious. Brooke has children by several different men, including Eric, so she and Ridge may not be an ideal pairing anymore. Eric says they have been together more than several decades and he is afraid Katie is the one who will be hurt this time. She says the fact that Ridge turned down the CEO if he would dump Katie says a lot about his character and his commitment to her. Destiny has changed her course. Brooke is with Bill now and she is with Ridge and she really wants Eric to accept that. She tried to deny Ridge's love but she will not apologize to Eric, to Brooke, to anyone. There is beauty in the unexpected and Eric just needs to open his eyes to see it. He says under different circumstances he would be thrilled, but he thinks the future of FC is Brooke and Ridge. Katie says Brooke has interfered in her life enough .please do not make her and Ridge work alongside each other. Ridge is over Brooke. This is not payback or revenge. They are over. Eric says he has a meeting and needs to leave. He wishes only the best for Katie. He barely gets out the door and Brooke steps in and tells Katie how dare she tell Eric that she does not want Ridge working with Brooke. Hope and Wyatt are standing outside the trailer when he gets a call and tells her he just has to go sign something and will be right back. She says fine that she will just double-check inside and make sure he has everything stocked they need. As she is doing that, the engine starts and pedal to the metal, eat my dust ..objects start flying off the shelves. She wonders what the heck Wyatt is doing. Her cell rings and it is Liam. He tells her it is okay, it's just him. He quickly says she was almost pregnant with Wyatt's child and he knows it is desperate but he is all out of options so she is coming with him."

        "Wyatt: What did the test say? Hope?",
        "Liam: Are you pregnant?",
        "Bill: Gonna be able to do this every day. You know how happy that makes me?",
        "Brooke: [Chuckles] It makes me happy, too. Every morning, every noon, every night, every midday, every second...",
        "Bill: Every noon, every morning, every night, every midday. That's right. 24/7. The stallion is back.",
        "Brooke: I love my stallion.",
        "Bill: I love you, too. Now, you sure about this, right? Before I unpack my toothbrush and make it official?",
        "Brooke: Does it look like I have any doubts? Welcome home.",
        "Katie: Hey. You have a minute?",
        "Eric: Katie, please, come in. Well, it's nice to see you.",
        "Katie: Yeah. Same. I'm sure you must know why I'm here.",
        "Eric: I think I have some idea, yes.",
        "Katie: Making Ridge and Brooke co-vice presidents. Do you really think that's wise considering the situation?",
        "Eric: We're all grownups here, Katie.",
        "Katie: Oh, yeah, yeah. I agree. I agree. Ridge is obviously a grown man, perfectly capable of living his own life and choosing his own woman. So what exactly are you hoping to accomplish?",
        "Eric: It's a good thing for this company.",
        "Katie: The company? Making Ridge work closely with Brooke?",
        "Eric: They work well together. It's not the first time, you know.",
        "Katie: So, it's all about business? Or are you hoping that something more will happen between them? Is that what this is really all about? You know I've always respected you, Eric. Ridge and I are together now, so I'd like to know how you feel about that.",
        "Eric: To be honest? I'm surprised.",
        "Katie: Well, I guess it's safe to say that you're not alone. Kind of threw us all for a loop.",
        "Eric: I'm sure it did. Katie, look... I've always admired and respected you. I think you're a terrific woman.",
        "Katie: But?",
        "Eric: But I feel that Ridge and Brooke belong together.",
        "Katie: After all this time, all the deceptions and disappointments, you still think that?",
        "Eric: I do, yes. I feel that Ridge is the only man for Brooke.",
        "Brooke: You have been so understanding and so patient.",
        "Bill: Well, I knew you'd come aro-- well, actually, I have to scratch that. I hoped you would come around. I did, uh, have a little bit of doubt for a minute there.",
        "Brooke: You have a little doubt?",
        "Bill: I know. I know it's rare, but it happens.",
        "Brooke: [Chuckles]",
        "Bill: You know, what I did with Katie, that was -- that was wrong.",
        "Brooke: That was all in the past.",
        "Bill: Put it in the rearview mirror?",
        "Brooke: Mm-hmm. And I had to try and see if things would work with Ridge. Thought it would be good for R.J. And the family, Katie.",
        "Bill: I know. I don't blame you for it. But I want you to be honest with me, Brooke. You sure all of this, my -- my moving back in, is not a reaction to Ridge and Katie?",
        "Brooke: How can you ask me that?",
        "Wyatt: Dude, I don't want you here. This is a private matter between hope and me.",
        "Liam: Just tell me you're not pregnant with his baby. Just say it.",
        "Wyatt: Would you just get out of here?! This is not even close to being any of your business!",
        "Hope: Guys, guys, please!",
        "Liam: Hope, I'm dying here.",
        "Hope: I know -- I know you both are, but can I say something? A lot has happened in the past couple months. Wyatt and I have gotten really close. We're together. We're in a relationship. But we're not having a baby.",
        "Wyatt: What?",
        "Liam: You serious?",
        "Hope: No. I'm not pregnant.",
        "Eric: Ridge and Brooke have a child. They've been together more years than not. You have to understand what you're up against.",
        "Katie: Well, Brooke has children with many people, Eric, you included. I mean, can't you just allow for the possibility that Ridge and Brooke as an entity, as a thing, has run its course? Maybe he's just outgrown her.",
        "Eric: You really believe that? After all these decades?",
        "Katie: I don't think he would be with me if that weren't true.",
        "Eric: I'm afraid you're gonna get hurt by this, Katie.",
        "Katie: I know all about the deal you offered Ridge. C.E.O. If he leaves me and goes back to Brooke.",
        "Eric: He turned me down.",
        "Katie: Of course he did. It's blatant manipulation. But I think it says a lot about his character. It says a lot about his commitment to me.",
        "Eric: I know my son. And I don't think he's given this offer enough thought.",
        "Katie: So you thought you'd just help things along, nudge him toward Brooke. I mean, it's obvious what you're doing. You think that this is going to be belief 2.0 and that ultimately they'll end up on the lab room floor with their clothes off. But not this time, Eric. Destiny has changed course. Brooke is with Bill now. Did you know that? And I'm with Ridge. And I really, really want you to be able to accept that.",
        "Wyatt: So, you're not pregnant?",
        "Hope: Nope.",
        "Liam: Thank god.",
        "Wyatt: Are you okay?",
        "Hope: Yeah. Yeah, I think so. I mean -- I mean, are -- are you?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. Yeah, whatever you -- you know. I mean, as long as you're good, I'm good.",
        "Hope: No, yeah, I-I... I really think that it's... probably for the best.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. Me, too.",
        "Hope: Yeah. [Chuckles]",
        "Liam: Well, I'm gonna... gonna let you guys deal with this. Let me just say this is the best news I've heard in a long time, and I'm not just talking about for me.",
        "Wyatt: Did anyone ask you?",
        "Liam: Wyatt, you know what? I love this woman, okay? I've loved her for years. I love her self-respect. I love her values. And if you think I'm not gonna rejoice in the fact that she's not carrying the child of a guy she's not even engaged to, you're ridiculous!",
        "Wyatt: Oh, my -- this is not even about you.",
        "Liam: I'm just relieved, okay? I'm relieved for you. This was a close call, and it would have changed everything.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, we know. Look, can we just talk about this when we're alone? You know, after we hitched up the trailer and just get on the road?",
        "Hope: Yeah, of course.",
        "Wyatt: Okay.",
        "Liam: I'll -- I'll let you two...talk.",
        "Hope: Okay. Thanks.",
        "Liam: Okay. Bye.",
        "Hope: [Sighs]",
        "Wyatt: Wow.",
        "Hope: [Sighs]",
        "Wyatt: I'm shocked that he just did that.",
        "Hope: What?",
        "Wyatt: Just left like that so easily. I mean, I was expecting the typical self-righteousness. You know, that he'd tear into me and give us a lecture, and I'm surprised that he didn't make a play for you. Maybe he wised up. I...huh.",
        "Eric: Ridge and Brooke have a very strong connection.",
        "Katie: Of course they do. It would be strange if they didn't. They've been through a lot together. They share a child, as you said. But people change, Eric.",
        "Eric: He's gonna hurt you, Katie.",
        "Katie: I don't think so. We are so happy right now. We are in such a good place.",
        "Eric: He has a way of making a woman feel like she's the most special person in the world.",
        "Katie: So you're saying it's all an act? Just something he's good at? That he couldn't possibly really feel these things for me? It's okay if you believe that. Because that's what I believed, too. And I tried to deny my feelings for him, and I tried to walk away from him, and ultimately, I couldn't do it. And I cannot apologize for my feelings now -- not to you, not to Brooke, not to anyone. Our relationship may not make sense to you, but that's okay, because there's beauty in the unexpected, and you just have to open your eyes and see it.",
        "Bill: Don't think for a minute that I don't know how lucky I am. Being back here with you, your arms around me... in our bed, in our home.",
        "Brooke: Hmm. Yeah. You are pretty lucky.",
        "Bill: [Laughs]",
        "Brooke: But I'm pretty lucky myself.",
        "Bill: Oh, you -- you kidding me? After what went on in this room? You are really lucky.",
        "Brooke: Oh, yeah. It was really incredible.",
        "Bill: [Laughs]",
        "Brooke: Ohh, and I wish I could just stay in bed with you all day.",
        "Bill: Yeah, but instead you're gonna leave Mr. Unemployed here all by himself.",
        "Brooke: Oh, I have to. I have to get to the office. There's some things I have to do. But you know what I'm happy about?",
        "Bill: Hmm?",
        "Brooke: I get to come home and see you all over again.",
        "Bill: You know, I really don't need too much in life. You, my boys, and the ability to provide for my family.",
        "Brooke: You take care of everybody so well.",
        "Bill: I want will back. Equal custody. And maybe now that Katie has Ridge, she won't fight me on it.",
        "Brooke: Will does need his father.",
        "Bill: I want my son back. And I want my company back.",
        "Brooke: Did you talk to Karen?",
        "Bill: She won't return my calls. I mean, it's ridiculous. Okay, so, you know, we haven't seen eye-to-eye on -- on everything in our lives, but overall, I've been very supportive of her and made her a ton of money. And how does she thank me? Teaming up with Katie and stealing my company.",
        "Brooke: I understand how you want to get in there and you want to turn things around. But it just might be out of your control.",
        "Wyatt: That was kind of crazy.",
        "Hope: Yeah. [Chuckles] I'm kind of relieved that it turned out the way it did. Just with everything going on right now, you know, a-a baby would... you know, I'm -- I'm definitely not ready.",
        "Wyatt: I-I'm glad that you're saying that, because I'M... I'm really not that ready, either.",
        "Hope: Okay. [Chuckles] Okay. So, we just have to be more careful about protection.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. Lesson learned.",
        "Hope: Yeah.",
        "Wyatt: You know, I-I just... I want you to know that... I would have been okay with it, you know? I-I would have supported you no matter what. You know that, right?",
        "Hope: Yeah, I know. I do. I know you would have been there for me.",
        "Wyatt: And we would have dealt with it together. Whatever you decided, yeah.",
        "Hope: Thank you for being so sweet and supportive.",
        "Wyatt: And for the record, um, there is no other woman in the world that I would rather have a kid with...",
        "Hope: [Chuckles]",
        "Wyatt: ...Than you. I mean, but I know how important it is for both of us to take things slowly. You know, you're not ready for marriage or babies, and neither am I, and we're young, you know? We -- we -- we've got our whole life to have a ton of kids.",
        "Hope: A ton?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. A whole soccer team.",
        "Hope: Oh, god.",
        "Wyatt: Maybe some subs. I haven't done the numbers yet.",
        "Hope: That's a good amount. How about we start with maybe, like, two or three tops, actually?",
        "Wyatt: We can start there, yeah.",
        "Hope: Yeah. [Chuckles] But that's -- you know, that's a long way off.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, way, way, way down the road, yeah.",
        "Hope: Yeah. Okay.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Hope: I'm glad you agree. Okay.",
        "Wyatt: What -- what do you say that we -- we get out of here, hmm?",
        "Hope: Another road trip?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Hope: Yeah.",
        "Wyatt: I mean, the trailer's all stocked up for whatever we need. We can talk about what happened, and in our case, what didn't happen.",
        "Hope: [Chuckles] Yeah.",
        "Wyatt: And discuss our futures, and we can make a bonfire, and we can camp under the stars, and... I don't care what we do or where we end up. I just...I can't wait to get away with you.",
        "Hope: [Sighs]",
        "Katie: This idea you have of Ridge and Brooke, it doesn't exist anymore. You need to put it in the past.",
        "Eric: I don't think I will.",
        "Katie: Ridge needs your support, Eric. He wants it. And I don't expect it today or tomorrow, but please, please do not make some kind of special effort to sabotage us.",
        "Eric: Under any other circumstances, I would be thrilled, but I believe that Ridge and Brooke are the future of this company and my family.",
        "Katie: Brooke has interfered in my life enough. I don't need this from you. Please do not force Ridge to work side-by-side with her as co-vice presidents.",
        "Eric: Katie, it's nothing personal.",
        "Katie: No, no, that's where you're wrong. This is very personal, and you know it. This is not just about business. Ridge and I are in love. We are committed to each other. It's genuine. And I just want you to be able to understand that.",
        "Eric: Feelings can be fleeting, deceptive.",
        "Katie: Not this time.",
        "Eric: Maybe he's on a rebound here. Maybe he's using this to get back at Brooke.",
        "Katie: He's over her! This is not about payback. It's not about revenge. Ridge and Brooke are over.",
        "Eric: Katie, I have a meeting. I'm sorry. I wish only the best for you.",
        "Katie: [Sighs]",
        "Brooke: How dare you tell Eric you don't want me working with Ridge.",
        "Katie: Well, what did you expect?",
        "Wyatt: You ready for another big adventure on the silver beast?",
        "Hope: Oh, how I've missed her.",
        "Wyatt: She's missed you, too.",
        "Hope: [Chuckles]",
        "Wyatt: She has.",
        "Hope: I think it'll be really good to get out of town for a while.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah? You sure? It's been pretty stressful lately.",
        "Hope: All the more reason to get away.",
        "Wyatt: Woman, I like your thinking.",
        "Hope: [Chuckles]",
        "Wyatt: And, you know, we can have -- we'll have plenty of time to talk about stuff. You know, or not. I mean, it's your call. Whatever you want to do. [Chuckles] Uh...",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Wyatt: All right, well, let's get this baby on the road. Shoot. Hello? Ohh, okay. Yeah. All right, I'll be there. Okay, bye. Uh, I got to go sign some P.O.S before we go.",
        "Hope: Yeah, that's fine. I'll just, you know, double-check, make sure we have everything.",
        "Wyatt: Okay.",
        "Hope: Okay. [Sighs] [Sighs] Yeah. All right.",
        "[Engine turns over]",
        "Hope: Oh, my -- [Gasps] Oh, my god! Wyatt! What is he doing?!",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Hope: Oh, my god. Liam?",
        "Liam: Hope, it's okay. It's just me.",
        "Hope: What are you doing?!",
        "Liam: You were almost pregnant with his child. It's drastic. I know. But I'm all out of options here, so...you're coming with me. . ."
