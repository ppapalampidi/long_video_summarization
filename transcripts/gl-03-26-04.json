        "Alan: Well, thank you all for coming. This is a very important meeting today because we are at a critical time in our history. But, of course, we are spauldings, and we will rise to the challenge.",
        "Lizzie: The challenge of sitting still as they take our picture.",
        "Beth: Lizzie, listen up. This is serious.",
        "Alan: That's all right, beth. Sitting still would help, james.",
        "Beth: Alan, are things really as dire as you make them sound?",
        "Alan and alexandra: Yes!",
        "Alan: If we don't handle the situation correctly, it could be the end of spaulding enterprises as we know it.",
        "Lizzie: Is this interview spin control?",
        "Alan: Yes. Very good, elizabeth. You see, in a few days, federal agents will be looking through all of our files and all of our records. Now, there's already word on the street that we are a sinking ship.",
        "Beth: Are we?",
        "Alan: Absolutely not. And that's why we must appear to be strong and unified, to show that this family will never crack or sell out spaulding.",
        "Alexandra: (Scoffs) right.",
        "Alan: Well, stephanie, I'm so glad that you could come. Thank you, kenneth. Um, I would like for you to meet my family.",
        "Olivia: Oh, good evening, everyone. Hello. Hello, elizabeth. I am sorry I'm late.",
        "Marah: I don't want to end our relationship.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, you don't have a choice.",
        "Marah: How can you say that? After what happened last night?",
        "Jeffrey: You know what happened last night? Someone took a picture of us last night in the pool house.",
        "Marah: What?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah. Someone took a picture of us when we were making love, marah.W3 the paparazzi is everywhere now, and they're going to continue to be everywhere. They're going to be hunting us down.",
        "Marah: Now what? Oh, I get it. So this is your damage control?",
        "Jeffrey: These people are after scandal, marah. When they see us together, all they're going to think about is cover-ups and conspiracies.",
        "Marah: But that's not the truthb[",
        "Jeffrey: Marah, a picture is worth a thousand denials. If you don't believe me, just check out the front page of any tabloid newspaper tomorrow morning.",
        "Marah: You think that I'm going to break it off with you because of that? Because you came to my house, because you feel what you feel for me?",
        "Jeffrey: Don't you understand, marah? Your future, your entire future hinges on whether or not a jury believes your story about what happened that night with caroline caruthers. Your credibility is everything. Doris wolfe knows that. That's why when she comes after you, she's not going to come after you just for the shooting. She's going to come after you for our relationship also, and when she does, you got to be ready to blow it up in her face. You've got to convince her that you think that I am nothing but some sleazy, skirt- chasing dirt- bag who took advantage of you.",
        "Marah: No.",
        "Jeffrey: Marah...",
        "Marah: Jeffrey, I said I will not do that.",
        "Reva: What do you mean, you're not who I think you are?",
        "Christopher: I've been hiding something from you, reva. I work for the government. I have been for a long time.",
        "Reva: As a consultant, right? Working on cases, like you do with jeffrey.",
        "Christopher: My involvement goes a lot deeper than that. I've worked with the cia, the fbi and a few other smaller agencies you may not have heard of.",
        "Reva: As an agent? And what exactly is your involvement?",
        "Christopher: I serve in several different capacities. I guess you'd call me a[ \u00d1 profiler.",
        "Reva: You get into the minds of criminals.",
        "Christopher: That's one of my functions, yes. Also, when the government targets someone for use, someone with unique abilities to gather information, I watch them and assess their potential.",
        "Reva: Watch them?",
        "Christopher: Before I make contact with them and help them to develop their skills. It's no accident that you and i met last year, reva. I've been watching you for a long time.",
        "Reva: You should go.",
        "Christopher: Not yet.",
        "Reva: No, you need to go.",
        "Christopher: Reva, there's something else I need to say.",
        "Reva: You just said that every word out of your mouth has been a lie, and yet you have the nerve to say we're not done?",
        "Christopher: Not all of it is a lie.",
        "Reva: Just who you are, what you do, why you're here. What am I, a guinea pig? What exactly is it you do? We meet, and then you go back to wherever you go back to and you, what, write progress reports and hand them over to your superiors?",
        "Christopher: That's not how it was.",
        "Reva: \"We had a good day today. I really got through to the subject. We almost kissed.\" I'm not far off, am I?",
        "Christopher: Part of my job is to get close to my subjects.",
        "Reva: And the story about your wife's tragic death-- what, did you learn that at quantico? Earn sympathy 101?",
        "Christopher: Do you honestly believe that I made that up? I am not supposed to develop personal feelings...",
        "Reva: Don'T. Don'T. Don't do that. You really should leave, unless of course you have something more to say.",
        "Christopher: Yes, I do.",
        "Reva: Well, I'm not interested. You know what I'm doing right now? I am fighting for my daughter's freedom, and fool that I am, i thought maybe you might be able to help me out with it.",
        "Christopher: I can help you with this. You just told me that you're very close to figuring out what maryanne wants from you.",
        "Reva: I can't trust you. Everything we had, you're asking me to fall back on that, and it's no longer true.",
        "Christopher: My ability to help you is real. If maryanne's message is not clear to you, then I can take you the rest of the way. Reva, I have taught you. I have told you how to develop your gifts.Z please let me finish the job.",
        "Reva: Mine, or yours?",
        "Christopher: Fine. Hate me, doubt me. But if you don't let me help you fight for marah, then you are the fool.",
        "Marah: I will not let you change history just because you want me to do something your way. The truth is, jeffrey, I'M...",
        "Jeffrey: The truth, marah? There is no truth, okay? Get that through your head. There's no truth, especially not in the courtroom, okay? It's nothing but the perception of the truth that matters.",
        "Marah: Why are you trying to scare me?",
        "Jeffrey: Maybe you need to be scared. If you put yourself in front of that grand jury and start telling the truth, any prosecutor worth his salt is going to twist and turn everything that you say until you start to wonder whether there is any truth at all in this world.",
        "Marah: Well, I'm ready for that.",
        "Jeffrey: No, you're not. You're not ready for it. You have no idea. You've never been through it.",
        "Marah: Yes, I have. I went through it with ross. He went at me just like doris wolfe would.",
        "Jeffrey: With ross... it's not exactly the same thing, is it?",
        "Marah: Okay. \"Ms. Lewis, what did mr. O'neill know about you the night that you... he had dinner at your parents' house?\" Well, he knew that tony and I... \"he knew that tony had rejected you and that you were brokenhearted over him.\" Yes, that is correct.",
        "Jeffrey: And mr. O'neill was also aware that you were on the rebound from a certain young gentleman by the name of sandy, with whom you formed a certain attachment. Isn't that true, ms. Lewis? That is, until you found out that he was your half-brother, right?",
        "Marah: Yes, mr. O'neill was aware of that.",
        "Jeffrey: He was aware of that. So, in other words, on the evening in question, mr. O'neill was aware that you had opened yourself up and trusted these two men who had betrayed you.",
        "Marah: That's correct.",
        "Jeffrey: That's correct. Well, that's not a very good track record is it, hmm? Now, did you ever ask yourself why you have loved and lost so many times, ms. Lewis?",
        "Marah: It's not so many times.",
        "Jeffrey: Not so many times?",
        "Marah: Just twice.",
        "Jeffrey: Just twice? Well, two out of two, that's batting a thousand. That's a pretty good track record, I'd say. Huh? Two-time loser.",
        "Marah: All right, jeffrey, that's enough.",
        "Jeffrey: Hm? Isn't it also true, ms. Lewis, that jeffrey o'neill was aware of that? Hm? And that he was also able to see it, because you wear your heart on a sleeve-- isn't that true, ms. Lewis? For everyone to see.",
        "Marah: There's nothing wrong with having feelings.",
        "Jeffrey: Answer the question, ms. Lewis.",
        "Marah: Yes.",
        "Jeffrey: I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.",
        "Marah: Yes! Yes! Okay, I wear my heart on my sleeve. Where is this going?",
        "Jeffrey: It's going straight to hell unless you wise up.",
        "Olivia: Now, where do you want me to sit?",
        "Alan: Olivia, I had no idea that you would be joining us.",
        "Olivia: Alan, where else would I be but with the family, when spaulding is going through such a crisis?",
        "Stephanie: That's how you would describe the company situation? \"In crisis\"?",
        "Alan: Stephanie, I thought you were here to do a piece on the family, not the company.",
        "Olivia: But the family is the company, alan. You've always said that, and if spaulding enterprises is facing disaster, then of course it's going to affect the spaulding family, which makes me a key part of the story. You know, the fact that I'm family and all.",
        "Beth: Olivia, did phillip ask you to be here as his representative?",
        "Olivia: Ms. Gandel, I'm sure you're aware that I recently married phillip. I have to say that I couldn't be happier to be back in the fold and with this family that I care so much about. You can quote me on that.",
        "Alexandra: I may throw up, and you can quote me on that.",
        "Olivia: Phillip is just the best husband that I could ask for, and alan has... alan has taught me so much about making decisions. And alexandra. What can I say about alexandra spaulding except she is just a role model for all strong- minded corporate women.",
        "Beth: Well, don't stop now.V",
        "Olivia: Beth has been a wonderful friend and advisor, and as far as phillip's wonderful children, zach, james and lizzie, I feel so blessed to be their stepmother.",
        "Stephanie: Does this mean you'll be working for spaulding enterprises?",
        "Alan: Uh, actually...",
        "Olivia: Actually, thef* answer's yes and no. On the one hand, alan has insisted that I come onboard.",
        "Alan: Uh, olivia?",
        "Olivia: But on the other hand, it won't be as a regular executive. I'll be working in a special capacity, as the spaulding liaison to the federal agencies that are looking into the alleged irregularities that you've no doubt heard of.",
        "Stephanie: Yes, about the allegations of the mob involvement.",
        "Olivia: Which is absolutely ridiculous, let me tell you that. That's why I'm here: To help clean this mess up. See, I've been out of springfield for a while, so in a sense, I'm an outsider. But the investors will look at me as being a little more objective and serious about this, which I am. I plan to see to it that the individuals responsible for tarnishing the good name of this company, and this family, are rooted out and brought to justice.",
        "Photographer: Ms. Spencer, could you please sit in the center?",
        "Olivia: I would be honored.",
        "Photographer: One spot over, if you don't mind.",
        "Olivia: Oh, I'm sorry.\u00d1i",
        "Alexandra: (Laughs) oh, dear. Sorry, dear.",
        "Olivia: Well, isn't this nice?",
        "Photographer: Smile. Good.",
        "Stephanie: Thank you for you and your family's time, mr. Spaulding.",
        "Alan: Well, thank you so much for coming, stephanie. Kenneth will show you two out. Olivia?",
        "Olivia: Hm?",
        "Alan: I would like a word with you alone, in the hall.",
        "Olivia: Sure. You got it. Save my seat. Thanks.",
        "Alan: What the hell were you thinking in there? That performance was absolutely...",
        "Olivia: It saved your butt. It was absolutely necessary.",
        "Alan: No, it wasn'T. I was in total control.",
        "Olivia: Have you been dipping into the antimonious?",
        "Alan: Not funny.",
        "Olivia: What's not funny is the prospect of spaulding enterprises if this scandal breaks without safeguards in place.",
        "Alan: Safeguards? Like what?",
        "Olivia: Like me, alan. Investors are going to scramble to unload their stock if a change isn't made, if the people in charge at spaulding are the same ones who got this company into this mess in the first place.",
        "Alan: Not necessarily.",
        "Olivia: It just kills you to admit that I'm right.>#W but you know that I am. You need someone with clean hands, a proven track record, and familiarity with this company, to step in. Alan, you need me.",
        "Beth: You sat pretty still while olivia was holding forth. I'm proud of you.",
        "Alexandra: Well, don't I get points? I mean, I'm sitting here thinking of every single item in this room I can shove down the woman's gullet.",
        "Lizzie: Well, it was bad, but it wasn't that bad.",
        "Beth: You're not upset?",
        "Lizzie: Not really, no.",
        "Beth: Honey, the only thing you could talk about when we were at ravenwood the other day was how you didn't trust olivia.",
        "Lizzie: Well, you know, I was just thinking about what grandpa said about family and how we need to stick together right now, and I think he's right.",
        "Alexandra: You do? Well, that's wonderful, darling. I mean, you should.",
        "Lizzie: Well, I'm not going to start an olivia spencer fan club or anything, but if she's trying to do the right thing for daddy or for all of us, I think we should give her a chance.",
        "Bill: (Whistles) you miss me?",
        "Eden: You were making a phone call.",
        "Bill: I cannot believe this. Here it is. We're engaged for two hours and you're already taking me for granted. That hurts me right here. Right here.",
        "Eden: You are so weird. (Laughter)",
        "Bill: And a little pathetic. And a little pathetic, too, i think, because I can't believe that I asked everyone I know how they proposed and if they liked getting married and...",
        "Eden: You are pathetic and weird, and it gets better and better and better.",
        "Bill: And I'm all yours.",
        "Eden: I know I acted a little weird, too, right after you proposed. It's just... I never had much luck in my life, and I was sure as soon as I accepted your proposal that a brick was going to fall on my head.",
        "Bill: So far so good. (Laughs) I'm kidding you.",
        "Eden: Okay, I am relaxing.",
        "Bill: Mm-hmm.",
        "Eden: And I wrote \"eden lewis,\" \"eden august lewis,\" and \"mrs. Bill lewis.\"",
        "Bill: I like the way that looks, and I like the way it sounds. Now, does this make it, you know, seem more real?",
        "Eden: Yeah.",
        "Bill: Yeah?",
        "Eden: And this ring on this chain right here.",
        "Bill: Yes.",
        "Eden: It's beautiful. It's really beautiful.",
        "Bill: It's going to be even more beautiful on your finger.",
        "Eden: I promise. Soon.",
        "Reva: I want to believe you. That's how dumb I am.",
        "Christopher: I tried to get out of this assignment, you know.",
        "Reva: Really? When?",
        "Christopher: After that day at the ferry dock. That's when I realized it, when it hit me that I really cared for your family and for you.",
        "Reva: Well, we can't have that now, can we?",
        "Christopher: I tried to walk away before it got too complicated.",
        "Reva: Let me guess: They wouldn't let you quit.",
        "Christopher: No. And I'm glad they didn't, now, because something good can still come of this, reva, if you're willing to give it a chance.",
        "Reva: I'm not going to let you help me with this just because you're feeling guilty.",
        "Christopher: Well, how guilty are you going to feel if you deny marah this huge potential boost because of your own pride? Let me help you help her.",
        "Cassie: So, he told you?",
        "Reva: How do you know?",
        "Cassie: Oh, it's a long story, but basically, edmund found out; he told me. So I guess my finding out is why you're here.",
        "Reva: So you're here because you wanted to beat cassie to the punch, is that it? That's the only reason you're telling me the truth now is because your hand was forced.",
        "Christopher: I couldn'T...",
        "Reva: You would have kept on lying to me.",
        "Christopher: I couldn't blow my cover without an okay from my superior.",
        "Reva: Well, your superiors. I'm so glad we followed protocol.",
        "Christopher: This does not change my offer, reva.",
        "Reva: Go.",
        "Cassie: What offer?",
        "Reva: He still wants to help me with marah's case. But how can I even be with someone, much less work with them, when I can't trust them? All you care about is what your superiors want. Well, you know what I care about? My daughter's life. And what she's going through right now is far too important to let you be a part of it, so go. Go back to your superiors, whoever it is.",
        "Cassie: I know who it is. It's jeffrey o'neill.",
        "Jeffrey: Do you want to go to prison?",
        "Marah: What do you think?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, then do as i ask.",
        "Marah: Sell you out; go on record saying that you are some...",
        "Jeffrey: That I'm a sexual opportunist, marah. That's what I am.",
        "Marah: Jeffrey, don't you know me at all?",
        "Jeffrey: Marah...",
        "Marah: I came forward on my own and confessed to killing carrie. Do you really think I'm going to back down now when it comes to my personal life?",
        "Jeffrey: It's not a matter of backing down. It's a matter of you going to prison for 20 years.",
        "Marah: It was self-defense!",
        "Jeffrey: It's going to be murder one when doris wolfe is done with it.",
        "Marah: You just want me to pretend that you were just some sleazy guy that I never had any feelings for.",
        "Jeffrey: There you go. That's perfect.",
        "Marah: Well, I'm sorry, jeffrey, but I can't lie. I pursued you, remember? I convinced you to sleep with me.",
        "Jeffrey: Are you sure about that?",
        "Marah: Yes.",
        "Jeffrey: Jeffrey o'neill, the well-known womanizer, just kept a beautiful, willing young bed partner at arm's length because, what? He had a crisis of morality?",
        "Marah: That's what happened.",
        "Jeffrey: Really? So it couldn't have been a ruse or a way to lure you in? Marah, don't you see? You were just a vulnerable little girl who just came out of a messed-up relationship.",
        "Marah: It wasn't messed up.",
        "Jeffrey: Your little boyfriend hurt you. He treated you badly. He burned you. It was too easy. I mean, all I had to do was just show you a little kindness, and you melted. Then, of course, I kept my distance and played hard to get to make you think that you were doing the chasing and that I was worth the chase.",
        "Marah: No, that's not how it was.",
        "Jeffrey: Do you know how many times I've done this? You were no match for me.",
        "Marah: That's not how it was.",
        "Jeffrey: How do you know that, marah, hmm? How do you know?",
        "Marah: Jeffrey, please.",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, yeah. You were... you were ripe for the plucking, marah. Don't you know?",
        "Marah: Okay, you've proved your point.",
        "Jeffrey: I knew how unattractive you felt. I knew how unwanted you felt.",
        "Marah: I kept pushing you.",
        "Jeffrey: You kept pushing me? Come on, think about it. Think back. I never cut you off, did I? No. You know why? Because I was stringing you along. I gave you a little shoulder to cry on. I told you to be open to everything that the world brought to you. And then, of course, I took myself off-limits. It's the oldest trick in the book, marah, and you fell for it. It was a perfect setup.",
        "Marah: It was a setup?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, a setup. People want what they can't have, and what could be more tantalizing to a young woman than a man that she can't have?",
        "Marah: Okay, jeffrey, i get...",
        "Jeffrey: And you know what's really pathetic, is before you even left the hotel room that night that i did have you, I was already thinking about the next person, and that's the truth.",
        "Marah: That is not...",
        "Jeffrey: That is the truth, marah! And the truth is flexible. When are you going to learn that? That's what I'm trying to tell you here. Did I or did I not control every move that you made at that police station? I controlled the booking, I made sure it went as smooth as silk, and I made sure that it was kept quiet. Now, do you think I did that to spare you any anguish? Come on, honey. I did it because I knew that if anyone found out that you were one of the notches on my bedpost, that I might have trouble and that my career might be in trouble. And that, my dear, was not going to happen over some stupid one- night stand on new year's eve.",
        "Marah: Okay! Stop it! I mean it!",
        "Jeffrey: I had to control it. I had to make it go away. And I did control it, okay? I had to manipulate the witnesses; I had to manipulate the details; I had to coach witnesses; I had to coach you.",
        "Marah: No! No, you didn't!",
        "Jeffrey: I told you everything.",
        "Marah: No! You were helping me, not yourself. You were helping me!",
        "Jeffrey: No. Wrong.",
        "Marah: Everything I did was my choice!",
        "Jeffrey: Your choice? Really? Does that include shooting caroline caruthers? Was that your choice? Because you made such a big deal how you had no choice. You had no choice but to pull that trigger. You had no choice but to kill her to protect your father and those other men. Or maybe it's all wrong. Maybe they got it all wrong. Maybe that was your choice.",
        "Marah: No! No! Stop!",
        "Jeffrey: Maybe you shot caroline caruthers because that's the way you had planned it. Maybe it was cold murder. Cold, premeditated murder.",
        "Marah: No! Jeffrey. (Sobbing)-9",
        "Jeffrey (softly): That's what they're going to do to you.",
        "Cassie: I know you trusted christopher with your deepest stuff. You trusted your instincts, reva.",
        "Reva: Don't remind me.",
        "Cassie: I know you feel betrayed, but don't discount your talent.",
        "Reva: You know, it hasn't done me or anyone in my family any good.",
        "Cassie: Yet.",
        "Reva: Well, you know something? I don't know if I'm willing to give it the time, because i can't count on it for anything. Why should I believe anything it tells me?",
        "Cassie: Because you have to.",
        "Lizzie: You don't believe me.\u00d1i well, I guess I didn't really expect you to.",
        "Beth: Sweetie, it's not that I don't believe you, it's just... how can I put this? I believe that you would like to wish olivia well.",
        "Lizzie: I'm just trying to think of what dad would want me to do.",
        "Beth: Okay. You have a point. I think it would make your father happy if we could all learn to accept his wife.",
        "Lizzie: Do you think dad's going to get out of ravenwood?",
        "Beth: Your father? Of course he will.",
        "Lizzie: He doesn't exactly seem to be getting better, mom.",
        "Beth: Honey, I know that it's frustrating, but we just have to hold on a little while longer. Your dad is a fighter, and he is going to get back to normal. That will happen, I promise you.",
        "Lizzie: Well, then, I promise to look out for him, and zach and james. I just want us to be a family, mom.",
        "Olivia: So, what? Am I hired or not?",
        "Alan: Olivia, it would be like letting the fox in the hen house.",
        "Olivia: Well, this fox is on your side, alan.",
        "Alan: When has that ever been true?",
        "Olivia: Whenever we've gone after the same thing. You want spaulding to survive this investigation; so do I. Call it the magic of vested interest.",
        "Alan: Or a quick marriage to phillip.",
        "Olivia: I'm family; get used to it. That makes me both the fox and the hen.",
        "Alan: I don't like you.",
        "Olivia: I know.",
        "Alan: But I think you could be useful.",
        "Olivia: Yeah? Well, did you hear that? He said I could be useful.",
        "Alan: You know that little pitch you made in there to the reporter a while ago, it made a certain amount of sense. You do have a reputation of being ruthless and an unbelievably tough boss.",
        "Olivia: Oh, thanks.",
        "Alan: Which might just be what we need for both pr and operations standpoint.",
        "Olivia: Well, you know, alan, as jp morgan once said, \"duh.\"",
        "Alan: Don't patronize me.",
        "Olivia: Oh, come on. Why can't you just admit that the odds are pretty damn good that I can clean this mess up and get this company back on track?",
        "Alan: Because I don't have to. You already have.",
        "Olivia: Then I'm in?",
        "Alan: You're in.",
        "Olivia: Oh, alan. You are a wise man. Don't worry, we'll beat this. There's nothing that you and alexandra have done that I can't fix. You'll see.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, no you don't, olivia. I'm not going to let you get one step closer to this family.",
        "Bill: Okay. Now, here is to us and little bill and little billie may.",
        "Eden: Billie may? Really? (Laughs)",
        "Bill: Yes.",
        "Eden: Do you know how much i love you?",
        "Bill: I think I do.",
        "Eden: I don't think I've ever been this happy. I don't think I could honestly ever say I was this happy. I'm going to spend the rest of my life trying to make you as happy as you make me. I love you.",
        "Bill: I love you, too.",
        "Cassie: Reva, I know you're hurt and I know you're angry but you've got to go back, okay? Rewind your feelings to before christopher came in here and hit you with this.",
        "Reva: What's the point?",
        "Cassie: To remember what's important. Like when I first came to town, before we found out we were sisters, you immediately started treating me like family. You knew there was a connection.",
        "Reva: Because it seemed natural.",
        "Cassie: Exactly. Because you trusted your instincts.",
        "Reva: It's gotten me into trouble too many times.",
        "Cassie: Well, then, isn't that a reason why you're doing this? To try and get a better handle on what you're picking up and how to use it? And speaking of instincts, do you really believe christopher was out to harm your family? Do you?",
        "Reva: No.",
        "Cassie: Then don't cut off this very important part of yourself. Don't do that, because it's going to hurt you and it's going to hurt marah.",
        "Reva: She needs me.",
        "Cassie: We all need you. Where else are we going to find someone as crazy as you?",
        "Reva: (Blows raspberry) (laughter) I love you.",
        "Cassie: I love you, too.",
        "Reva: There's someplace i have to go.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, good.",
        "Reva: Thanks.",
        "Jeffrey: If doris wolfe gets you on the stand and you react like that, it's over.",
        "Marah: Doris wolfe is not my lover.",
        "Jeffrey: Neither am I.",
        "Marah: Oh, well. Easy come, easy go, right?",
        "Jeffrey: You could go on trial for murder one.",
        "Marah: It's the perfect time to bail on me then.",
        "Jeffrey: This isn't about our feelings, you know. This is about your future and the people that hold your future in their hands.",
        "Marah: And what about our future?",
        "Jeffrey: We don't have one.",
        "Marah: You know, you don't fool me. You love me and want me just as much as I do you.",
        "Jeffrey: What I want doesn't matter.",
        "Marah: (Scoffs) how can you be like this? What? What do you want me to say to you, jeffrey? That I'll never see you again?",
        "Jeffrey: We've got to make tough choices sometimes, you know?",
        "Marah: Yeah, well, you're really good at that.",
        "Jeffrey: (Sighs) well, I learned you've got to keep it simple, marah, you know? I tried to tell you that. I tried to tell you that. You've got to keep the feelings out of it.",
        "Marah: Right.Zv but you didn'T. You didn't keep your feelings out of it when you risked your job and your reputation for me. And I can see your feelings right now.F'\u00fa",
        "Jeffrey: You're mistaken. This is just me, doing what i do. I cut my losses and I move on.",
        "Marah: Well, letting you go isn't cutting my losses.",
        "Jeffrey: Do it anyway. Let me get out of here before the press...",
        "Marah: (Weeping)",
        "Jeffrey: I know. I know.",
        "Alexandra: Well, please, please tell me that she's left.",
        "Alan: She's gone.",
        "Alexandra: With that insane idea shoved right back in her face, I hope.",
        "Alan: Hmm. Well, actually, alexandra, i told her that we would be delighted if she would help us at spaulding.",
        "Alexandra: (Laughs) what? Honestly, have you lost your mind?",
        "Alan: We have nothing to worry about.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, no, no, no. Only the most conniving, manipulative harpy on the western world, for heaven's sakes, who'll stop at nothing, work tirelessly to destroy us both.",
        "Alan: Well, I admit that she will probably try to undermine us, but we will be one step ahead. She will fail, because we are safe. We're insulated from the antimonious, and it's absolutely absurd that we would be connected to the mob in any way.",
        "Alexandra: Thank god. Thank god. So you really think we're okay?",
        "Alan: The heart and soul of this company are stronger than ever, and that is why we must never dump our stock.",
        "Alexandra: Right.",
        "Alan: Now, she will go on volunteering her elegant plans, but it will only end in her destruction, not ours.",
        "Alexandra: How's that?",
        "Alan: Well, all we have to do is wait. Ride it out, until phillip heals, comes back to his senses. Then he will no doubt-- and we will help him-- toss her out of the family for good. Then there will be nothing that will keep her tied to us.",
        "Olivia: It went as well as can be expected. I know, I know. How are things there? Yeah? Great. I just had to come by the beacon and get my messages, but I'm leaving now. And it's such a nice night, i think I'm going to walk. I'll walk. Okay. I'll see you soon. Love you too, sammy. Bye.",
        "Lizzie: \"I love you, too.\" Quite a big bag you had there, olivia. Maybe we should have searched you before you left spaulding. If you're stealing from my dad, I'm going to make you sorry.",
        "Reva (muttering): Oh, all right. (Sighs) all right, maryanne, I'm back. I need you to tell me what you know. And I need you to tell me now.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, it's me. I think we're ready for phase two. Because it's time, that's why. If we don't move on the spaulding drug connection now, we could lose the big fish, both in the company and in the mob. What? That's got nothing to do with it. That's got nothing to do with it, I told you. I recused myself from the lewis case. I'm not on it anymore. I'm completely out of it, okay? That's all you need to know.",
        "Paparazzo #1: There she is.",
        "Paparazzo #2: Marah, over here.",
        "Paparazzo #1: Why did you shoot caroline caruthers?",
        "Paparazzo #4: How long have you been sleeping with jeffrey o'neill? Were you using sex to... (paparazzi clamoring)",
        "Paparazzo #2: Marah, look over here.",
        "Marah: Leave me alone, please.",
        "Paparazzo #4: Do you love him?",
        "Paparazzo #3: Did you hate her, marah? One question, marah.",
        "Marah: No!",
        "Tony: Get on.",
        "Paparazzo: Marah, what were you thinking when you pulled the trigger?",
        "Marah: Tony?",
        "Tony: Marah, get on.",
        "Olivia: Next, on \"guiding light\"...",
        "Buzz: Alan, get to the point. Why did we have to drop everything and come here?",
        "Alan: It's about maryanne and carrie. And gentlemen, I promise you what I have to say will make your trip worthwhile.",
        "Rick: Baby.",
        "Gus: Baby?",
        "Rick: That's my baby, yeah.",
