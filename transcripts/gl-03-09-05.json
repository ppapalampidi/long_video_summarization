        "Sebastian: Passionate?",
        "Bill: Yeah, she's passionate about everything, including work, and I'd hate to see someone try and squash that... not that he would ever succeed.",
        "Sebastian: Look, I'm not interested in confrontation, okay? I came here to make friends, not enemies.",
        "Bill: Is that right?",
        "Sebastian: Mm-hmm.",
        "Bill: Well, let me tell you something. You've got some nerve showing up in springfield after what you did to holly and michelle. Keeping her away from her family and her kid?",
        "Sebastian: You know, you should get your facts straight, bill, because...",
        "Bill: Is that right?",
        "Sebastian: Yeah. Michelle volunteered to go with me. You can ask her yourself.",
        "Bill: She volunteered. Well, you locked her up and you held her against her will.",
        "Sebastian: You know what? Everybody makes mistakes.",
        "Bill: ( Scoffs ) oh, mistakes. Is that right? Let me tell you something: Mixing your loads of laundry-- that is a mistake, my friend.",
        "Sebastian: Yeah? And marrying your business partner so she doesn't get deported, what's that?",
        "Bill: Who the hell do you think you are?",
        "Sebastian: I am your wife's new business partner. You think I'm going to get the fringe benefits?",
        "Bill: Ah!",
        "Sebastian: Whoa. Now that, I think, was a mistake, my friend.",
        "Jonathan: Was that mom on the phone?",
        "Josh: Why?",
        "Jonathan: Well, I'm just worried about her, that's all. Have you heard from her?",
        "Josh: Not since this morning. Is there a problem?",
        "Jonathan: Better let her tell you about that.",
        "Josh: Wait. Did something happen with reva?",
        "Jonathan: Not reva. Cassie. She found out the truth about edmund, how he tried to playnb whack-a-mole with jeffrey's head and started that fire in the barn.",
        "Josh: Nice. Couldn't keep your mouth shut, huh?",
        "Jonathan: Is that the thanks we get for trying to protect this family?",
        "Josh: What do you mean, \"we\"?",
        "Jonathan: Well, I guess i pulled the trigger on the thing, but reva loaded the gun.",
        "Reva: Are you okay? Of course you're not. I am so sorry you had to find out about edmund the way you did. I know you must be shocked. But cassie, edmund is dangerous. He almost killed your friend. You and rj could have died in that fire, and I just wanted you to be safe, you and the kids. I am so sorry.W3",
        "Cassie: No, you're not. This is what you've wanted all along.",
        "Jeffrey: What the...? Edmund!",
        "Edmund: I warned you.",
        "Jeffrey: Get your hands off of me, edmund.",
        "Edmund: You just had to tell her, didn't you, mr. O'neill? You just had to tell cassie. Well, that was a bad move on your part, because if she leaves me, I have nothing left to lose. You know, maybe I should finish what I started in that barn.",
        "Olivia: Hey, carla, have you heard from my husband yet?",
        "Secretary: Not yet, mrs. Lewis. Shall I send mr. Lewis a copy of the deal?",
        "Olivia: No. No. I... no. The deal was between me and alan. Bill's not involved in this. I just... I sold part of the lewis construction building to alan. It's just business. I'll... I'll handle this. You can go home. I have to get home to my daughter, anyway.",
        "Secretary: Good night.",
        "Olivia: 'Night. Bill, where are you?",
        "Sebastian: Hello, olivia.",
        "Olivia: Sebastian? Where's my husband? What have you done with him?",
        "Nurse: Excuse me, sir. Cell phones aren't allowed in the hospital.",
        "Sebastian: Oh. Got to go.",
        "Olivia: Hospital? Sebastian? Sebastian! Oh, god. Oh, god, bill.",
        "Olivia: What did you do to my husband, and don't you lie to me. Alan put you up to this, right? He told me you would do anything to get ahead, including put my family in danger.",
        "Sebastian: Olivia, I am sot( sorry. I did everything I could for bill, but it was just... it was just too late. And I guess he won't be needing this any more. I am so sorry.",
        "Olivia: Oh, god. Oh, god.",
        "Bill: ( Snores )",
        "Olivia: ( Screams )",
        "Sebastian: ( Laughs ) well, what do you know? Terminal sleep apnea. ( Laughs )",
        "Alexandra: Okay.",
        "Lizzie: You know, when we talked about, you know, girl time, I kind of thought, like, pedicures, not pool.",
        "Alexandra: Well, I thought it was about time we started thinking outside the box. ( Laughs )",
        "Lizzie: So granddad told you to keep your eyes on me.",
        "Alexandra: Yes, he did. But we're here because of your father.",
        "Lizzie: My father wanted me to learn how to play pool?",
        "Alexandra: Yes. Your father wanted you to have a well-rounded life.",
        "Lizzie: Okay, wouldn't \"well- rounded\" be more like learning french and staying away from people like the coopers?",
        "Alexandra: Mm-hmm. I suppose your grandfather would agree with you, but right now i happen to be in charge. So, what's it going to be, my dear? Your choice: Pool or bowling?",
        "Lizzie: Okay. Rack 'em.",
        "Alexandra: ( Laughs )",
        "Jeffrey: I didn't do that, edmund, okay? I didn't file the charges against you.",
        "Edmund: Fine, then. Who did?",
        "Jeffrey: Look at you. You know, you are caught red- handed, and you're just looking for someone else to blame.",
        "Edmund: We were happy, mr. O'neill. We were this far from conceiving a child. I would have done anything to protect her.",
        "Jeffrey: From what, edmund? From you? Look, why don't you do the right thing for once in your life and get out of cassie's life? Give her a real chance at happiness, okay?",
        "Jonathan: Mom was worried about cassie. That's why she went to o'neill and had him put together the complaint against edmund. I figured she told you all this.",
        "Josh: You showed the complaint to cassie?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. Why am I going to wait for uncle eddie to strike again? We all know he's dangerous with the small fries-- first me, then rj. He almost charbroiled the little guy.",
        "Josh: Jonathan, come on. You don't care about cassie or her family. This is about you punishing edmund for destroying your childhood.",
        "Jonathan: I didn't have to do anything. Uncle eddie hung himself.",
        "Josh: What about reva then, huh? Do you care at all about what you're doing to her?",
        "Jonathan: It was all her idea.",
        "Josh: You've done nothing more than drive a wedge-- more of a wedge-- between her and her sister. Is that part of your master plan, jonathan?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. That's me: Puppet master, pulling my strings. I know what's eating at you, though. Reva confided in me, not you. Again. Better put in that 911 call to dr. Phil, try and get the old trust factor back in your marriage before it's too late, huh?",
        "Reva: Look, I was shocked about edmund, too. I didn't want to believe it.",
        "Cassie: That's a lie. You've had it in for him all along, reva.",
        "Reva: No. I admit that I was never as sure about him as you were, but i wanted to believe he'd changed, because of you.",
        "Cassie: How did you find out?",
        "Reva: Does it matter? The fact is, I handled it wrong. I should have come to you the minute I found out.",
        "Cassie: Then why didn't you, reva, if you were so worried about me?",
        "Reva: Because, cassie, i tried. The night we were having dinner here? But you were so full of hope for the future with you and edmund and a baby, I didn't want to ruin your happiness.",
        "Cassie: So you wait until we're in the middle of this in vitro process? Well, that's perfect timing.",
        "Reva: I know. I know. And I'm sorry, I am. Cassie, look, edmund had you somewhere. He had taken you somewhere, and we didn't know where you were. For all we knew, you might have been in san cristobel in that tower again, locked up.",
        "Cassie: So you go to jeffrey and you have him file a complaint.",
        "Reva: I had to do something to find you, to get edmund to bring you back.",
        "Cassie: Okay, so what was the plan? Please tell me. Was I supposed to wake up in the morning and open my door and find the cops standing out there waiting to arrest my husband?",
        "Reva: I wasn't even sure that I was going to file charges.",
        "Cassie: Then how did the papers wind up at the beacon?",
        "Reva: I... I don't know. It must have been some kind of a mistake, a clerical error from the da's office. Does it really matter, cassie? What's important is that you're safe and the kids are safe, and I will help you through this.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, now that you've gotten what you've wanted, you're going to take care of me. That's really nice, reva.",
        "Reva: That's not what i meant.",
        "Cassie: You know, all this warm, loving concern? It's crap, reva. This is about revenge, and you got it. I hope it's satisfying.",
        "Olivia: Hey, are you okay?",
        "Bill: ( Mumbles )",
        "Olivia: What happened to him?",
        "Sebastian: Billy-boy took a swing at me and I ducked, but the wall, it stayed still.",
        "Olivia: Well, why is he like this?",
        "Sebastian: Painkillers.",
        "Bill: Hey, beautiful. What are you doing here?",
        "Olivia: You okay?",
        "Bill: I should hit you with my other hand. ( Laughs ) just kidding, sea-bass.",
        "Olivia: Sea-bass?",
        "Bill: Yeah, sea-bass, my buddy here.",
        "Olivia: Your buddy?",
        "Bill: Yeah.",
        "Sebastian: We sort of bonded.",
        "Bill: Yeah, we did. I actually went to punch him, but he's a dodgy fellow, this guy. I ended up hitting the plaster.",
        "Sebastian: Plaster man.",
        "Bill: Yeah, that's right. No hard feelings, though. He gave me a ride here in his fancy car. That's pretty big of him, because I wanted to turn him into mincemeat.",
        "Sebastian: What are pals for?",
        "Bill: ( Laughs ) I'll tell you something, you're a kidnapper and a psycho, but you're a hell of a guy.",
        "Olivia: What are you on?",
        "Bill: I have no idea, sweetheart, but the world is a far, far better place.",
        "Sebastian: Don't knock it, liv. This could be the beginning of a very beautiful friendship.",
        "Lizzie: You know, I feel kind of bad. I think we should have went someplace that's more age- appropriate for you.",
        "Alexandra: Thank you very much, little girl, but I happen to like being with young people, all right? Besides, they have, for the most part, more hope. ( Laughs )",
        "Lizzie: I don'T. I mean, after everything I went through, I don't have hope for anything anymore.",
        "Alexandra: Come on, lizzie. All right, darling, you've had a difficult life, okay? But that's no reason to give up hope. You can't give up hope. You've got to keep wanting things. If you don't, I'll tell you, you will be doomed.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah. Well, dad wanted things, and look what happened to him.",
        "Alexandra: Your father had an amazing life.",
        "Lizzie: How can you say that?",
        "Alexandra: He was loved. He loved very deeply. I mean, you can't ask for more than that. You can't hope for more than that, darling. I mean, look, sometimes... well, love has a very funny way of just, you know, creeping up in the most unexpected places. Oh, shoot. And then, well, sometimes you can't even call it love. You don't know it's love because the person you may be in love with is the most irritating, maddening, exasperating person alive.R",
        "Lizzie: You're not talking about me and coop, are you?",
        "Alexandra: Am I?",
        "Lizzie: Because coop is by far the most irritating person i know, and it's definitely not love. It's not at all like that.",
        "Alexandra: Ah.",
        "Coop: Hello, hello, hello, ladies. I thought I recognized your car out there.",
        "Alexandra: Yeah. ( Laughs )",
        "Josh: I'm beginning to think you've developed an unnatural relationship with your mother.",
        "Jonathan: Like hamlet?",
        "Josh: More like norman bates.",
        "Jonathan: Oh, yeah. Better remember that next time you're in the shower. ( Laughs ) they don't make them like that anymore. ( Laughs ) psycho's more uncle eddie's thing, though-- stab them when they're at their most vulnerable, unable to defend themselves.",
        "Josh: Yeah. Sort of like what you did with tammy when you went after her, right?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, well, we all get hit on at some point in life. If you're smart, you wise up and move on.",
        "Josh: Or not.",
        "Jonathan: I guess some just don't make the cut. Nobody's ever going to mess with me again, though. I couldn't defend myself against alfred when I was a little kid, but I got edmund before he could get me.",
        "Josh: You're nothing more than a bully. You know that? Not too much different than the men you hate. But hey, you know, go for it. See how it works out.",
        "Jonathan: I'm not looking for anything.",
        "Josh: Well, that's good, because you're going to end up exactly how you started: Alone. Only this time it's going to be a little worse, because when you get there, you're going to know what you could have had. You're going to know what you missed.",
        "Edmund: Cassie knows I love her.",
        "Jeffrey: Love her? Edmund, you just locked her away from everything and everyone that she loves.",
        "Edmund: That was to protect her and our baby.",
        "Jeffrey: Oh come on, edmund. Face it. You've got no one to blame here but yourself.",
        "Edmund: Just stay away from her!",
        "Jeffrey: I'm not the problem, edmund. You are. And with any luck, cassie will finally see that and walk.",
        "Edmund: Cassie loves me, mr. O'neill. Even now. So don't get your hopes up. You don't stand a chance with her.",
        "Jeffrey: I'm not looking for a chance.",
        "Edmund: Oh, my god, man, of course you are. You always have been. I'm not the only one who sees it. Cassie sees it, too. She feels sorry for you, so don't kid yourself, mr. O'neill. You are the last man in the world she would ever want.",
        "Reva: Cassie, I never wanted to hurt you.",
        "Cassie: You know what? Now, wait. You know what's funny? It's that for months now, I have been trying to convince you how evil jonathan is. And it just must make you so happy to realize that I don't have a clue about my husband.",
        "Reva: There isn't anything happy about this. I hate this.",
        "Cassie: Do you?",
        "Reva: I don't like to see this pain in your eyes. I don't want you to have to go through this. But you have to know in your heart that it's better that you know now.",
        "Cassie: Go, reva. Just get out of here.",
        "Reva: No, I'm not going to leave you like this.",
        "Cassie: Fine. Then I'll go.",
        "Reva: No, cassie. You can be angry at me. That's fine. But I'm not the one that attacked jeffrey in that barn, and neither is jonathan.",
        "Cassie: Oh, god. I gave him all of me, reva. I believed in him. I never would have... I loved him. Why didn't he see that?",
        "Reva: He wanted to change, cassie, but he couldn'T.",
        "Cassie: This morning, we were so happy. Planning for the baby... it's like a dream now.",
        "Reva: Did you know before... did the embryos... did you go ahead and have them...",
        "Cassie: Reva. Reva, no. You headed off the transfer, okay? I'm not pregnant. Part of me wishes I was. Then cutting edmund out of my life really wouldn't be an option.",
        "Reva: You can't be thinking about staying with him. You can't, because I won't let you. Coming up on \"guiding light.\"",
        "Reva: Well, edmund has her totally confused. You know, she's putting the blame for all of this on jonathan and me.",
        "Josh: I'm sorry to say this, reva, but I think cassie's got it right.",
        "Edmund: You're my life. I will do anything... anything you want. Just please don't leave. Op",
        "Cassie: Stop telling me what to do.",
        "Reva: I wish I didn't have to!",
        "Cassie: Edmund loves me. He is hurting as much as I am, reva. I mean, when I walked out of that hotel room, he trashed the place. He was in so much pain.",
        "Reva: Sounds to me like he was out of control. Please, you've got to stay away from him.",
        "Cassie: I can't imagine leaving him, and I can't imagine staying with him.",
        "Reva: Okay. Okay. Then please just give yourself some time.",
        "Cassie: Time, time. The embryos are at the clinic waiting to be transferred.",
        "Reva: Okay. Call the clinic. Have them frozen. Just give yourself the chance to make a decision.",
        "Cassie: I don't want to talk about this with you!",
        "Reva: Okay. Okay, fine. Then just... I'll take you. I'll take you home. We'll get rj and will and we'll go home.",
        "Cassie: Home?",
        "Reva: Yes.",
        "Cassie: To your home?",
        "Reva: Yes.",
        "Cassie: ( Sighs ) do you think that I want to deal with jonathan on top of all this, reva?",
        "Reva: Jonathan won't bother you, honey. I promise.",
        "Cassie: It is because of jonathan, reva.",
        "Reva: What?",
        "Cassie: You are so blinded by your hatred of edmund, and you are so obsessed with jonathan, that you don't even see what you've done.",
        "Reva: Cassie...",
        "Cassie: I don't trust you, reva. I don't even know who you are, reva. Well, you know what? Jonathan's gotten what he wanted. I lost my sister.",
        "Jonathan: Should I watch my back? You and uncle billy going to strap me to a bronco and chase me off the edge of a cliff? Not that that would help your relationship with reva, of course.",
        "Josh: No, probably not, but it would certainly make my day.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, if you're so sure I don't stand a chance with cassie, why'd you try to kill me that night in the barn?",
        "Edmund: Fun?",
        "Jeffrey: You know, she's always had her doubts about you and your self- control. That's why she comes to me, edmund, in her time of need. She knows I'm not going to freak out in a crisis or lie to her.",
        "Edmund: My god, you've been lying to her all along, haven't you, mr. O'neill? I'm curious, have you told her about your impersonating richard down in san cristobel? No, I didn't think so. It's because you're too much of a coward.",
        "Jeffrey: No, a coward is someone who would strike someone in the dark, with his back turned.",
        "Josh: Hey, hey! Edmund! Edmund! Back off! Back off! What are you doing, huh? Do you want to lose everything? You want to end up in jail? You go somewhere and cool off.",
        "Edmund: You stay away from my wife.",
        "Josh: Just go, edmund. Right now. You okay?",
        "Jeffrey: I'm fine, thanks. Thanks, josh.",
        "Josh: You seen cassie?",
        "Jeffrey: No, I don't know where she is.",
        "Josh: All right. I'm going to try to find her.",
        "Jonathan: You're the da, man. How much longer are you going to let that guy mess with you?",
        "Jeffrey: I'd stay away from eddie boy for a while, if I were you.",
        "Coop: Well, I guess I scared lizzie away again.",
        "Alexandra: Maybe she ran into an old friend.",
        "Coop: It's kind of hard to be friends with lizzie.",
        "Alexandra: Don't give up on her. Not yet, please.",
        "Coop: Well, the fact that your brother doesn't want me within 50 feet of his granddaughter doesn't exactly help things out, either.",
        "Alexandra: Alan likes to keep a tight rein, you know? It's his way of protecting the family. Of course, it's not going to do any good. It'll just drive lizzie away. But you'd think a man of his experience would know that, wouldn't you? ( Laughs )",
        "Coop: You would. There she is. We thought you'd gotten lost or something.",
        "Lizzie: No, I just had to make a few phone calls. What are you still doing here? Are you on the clock?",
        "Coop: She's always business, isn't she?",
        "Alexandra: Yes, and she's much too young and too pretty for that, isn't she?",
        "Coop: I'd agree.",
        "Lizzie: Okay, wait a second. What's going on here?",
        "Alexandra: You know what? I think I've figured out a way for coop to earn his paycheck. He can drive you home, because I'm tired, and... well, you two play.",
        "Coop: That sounds good.",
        "Lizzie: No, I didn't say that that was okay.",
        "Alexandra: Don't keep her too long. Bring her home right away. I don't know how long I'm going to keep alan, you know, at bay. ( Laughs ) and you, darling, think outside the box. ( Sighs ) bye-bye.",
        "Lizzie: That was our secret code. She was helping me out, planning the next shot.",
        "Coop: Okay. Well, go for it.",
        "Bill: Ow. Ow, ow, ow.",
        "Olivia: I'm sorry. Take it easy, slugger.",
        "Bill: That's okay. I guess doing it here on the gurney is out of the question, then, huh?",
        "Sebastian: Ah, cupid, draw back thy bow. Later, lovers.",
        "Bill: Yeah. Hey, don't be a stranger, there.",
        "Sebastian: I will. And you, don't get into anymore fights with walls, chief.",
        "Bill: ( Laughs )",
        "Sebastian: Oh, and olivia, i wanted to say congratulations on the deal with alan. The lewis construction building? A sensational acquisition for spaulding.",
        "Bill: Wait a minute. What... what did you... I'm sorry, did you say something about the lewis building?",
        "Sebastian: I was just telling olivia that...",
        "Olivia: What a great location the lewis building is in.",
        "Bill: It's a prime location. We're going to hold on to that one for a long time, baby.",
        "Olivia: Why don't you rest, okay? I'm going to walk your friend sea-bass out. Don't you ever pull a stunt like that on me again.",
        "Sebastian: Look, I had no idea you were keeping bill out of the loop on the lewis deal.",
        "Olivia: No. No. I just haven't had a chance to tell him yet. It just happened.",
        "Sebastian: Okay, okay. Look, I'm not passing judgment, okay? Business is business. From now on, I won't make the mistake of bringing anything up in front of bill again.",
        "Olivia: Just stay away from him, period.",
        "Sebastian: Well, we've kind of got this bonding thing...",
        "Olivia: Stay away from him. You are nothing more than alan's hatchet man, and lucky me, i haven't snacked on one of those in months.",
        "Sebastian: ( Laughs ) all right. You know what, olivia? You are absolutely right. That's exactly what alan hired me to do, and if I were you, i would watch my back, because you have loved ones to consider.",
        "Jonathan: You let uncle eddie hit you, he's going to come back and hit you again, first chance he gets.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, something tells me he's starting with you, kid.",
        "Jonathan: What's with the hostility? We're both in the \"edmund tried to kill me\" club. I thought we were all working together-- me, you, and my mom.",
        "Jeffrey: It was you. You sent that complaint to cassie.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. It was the right thing to do, man. No need to thank me.",
        "Jeffrey: All right, listen up. You leave her alone or you'll answer to me.",
        "Jonathan: Wow. I guess edmund had a good reason to be flipped about you. Looks like dad's face has a thing for auntie cass.",
        "Jeffrey: Don't push your luck.",
        "Jonathan: Hey, man, she likes you, too. When she got that fax, you're the one she went running to, not edmund. Does that make you feel all warm and mushy inside?",
        "Jeffrey: That's good.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah.",
        "Jeffrey: You done?",
        "Jonathan: Did I hit a nerve?",
        "Jeffrey: I'm on to you.",
        "Jonathan: Doubtful.",
        "Jeffrey: I don't care about your need for revenge, so this little run of yours with cassie, it's over.",
        "Josh: Two more, please.",
        "Reva: Oh, joshua. ( Sniffles ) oh, honey. Oh, I'm so glad you're here. I've made a mess of everything. I tried to help her but i just... I couldn'T.",
        "Josh: I heard. ( Clears throat ) jonathan filled me in. So have you seen cassie?",
        "Reva: Yeah. She won't listen to me.",
        "Josh: How's she doing?",
        "Reva: She's in pain.",
        "Josh: What did you expect?",
        "Reva: Well, edmund has her totally confused. You know, she's putting the blame for all of this on jonathan and me.",
        "Josh: Well, I'm sorry to say this, reva, but I think cassie's got it right.",
        "Edmund: You're back.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, I just needed to get my keys, so I can go home.",
        "Edmund: Cassie. I know what you must be thinking when you see the room this way, but when you left, I was... i was...",
        "Cassie: I have to go.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, please. Cassie. You're my life. I will do anything,... anything you want, just please don't leave.",
        "Cassie: I can't do this right now, edmund.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, I understand. I understand you're angry. I understand that. I betrayed every promise we made to one another when I didn't tell you about the night in the barn. I know that.",
        "Cassie: I really have to get home to the boys.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, wait.",
        "Cassie: Edmund, please.",
        "Edmund: I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Just... just... please hear me out. I know if I can... I know if i can get you to listen to me, you'll understand. I wasn't myself the night I went after jeffrey. But I'm not that same person anymore. I'm not. You know that.",
        "Cassie: I'm not really sure of anything, anymore.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, please, i will do anything. I will do anything you want, anything at all. Just tell me what it is. Just... my god, don't leave me. Cassie.",
        "Cassie: Edmund.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, you're not afraid of me, are you?",
        "Olivia: If you come anywhere near my husband and my daughter...",
        "Sebastian: Hey, hey. Chill out, olivia. I'm not the enemy here, okay? Just because alan is trying to pit us against each other doesn't mean we have to be mortal enemies, all right? We can work together.",
        "Olivia: Oh, you think so?",
        "Sebastian: Yeah.",
        "Olivia: No. You're a ruthless, ambitious man who would bury me in a heartbeat and never look back.",
        "Sebastian: ( Laughs ) two peas in a pod, olivia. Two peas in a pod. I want everything to work out fine for everyone, okay? I would hate to see anything come between you and your daughter.",
        "Bill: Olivia!",
        "Olivia: I'll be right there. You better stay away from my family, sea-bass.",
        "Sebastian: Hm. Go tend to your husband.",
        "Bill: Sea-bass, unhand my wife.",
        "Olivia: How are you?",
        "Bill: How are you?",
        "Olivia: Well, I'm really worried about you.",
        "Bill: It's more than that. What's going on with you?",
        "Olivia: No, it's not. Nothing.",
        "Bill: Olivia, you've got... you've got to get away from it. That's what you've got to do.",
        "Olivia: Get away from what?",
        "Bill: Yeah, get away from it. Get away from spaulding. It's going to tear you apart. Look at you. You're falling apart at the seams.",
        "Olivia: No. I can handle this. I can handle it.",
        "Bill: You can handle this? It always ends badly. It always does. Look what happened to harley. You want to end up like that?",
        "Olivia: Nothing like that is going to happen to me. Come on.",
        "Lizzie: Yes! Oh, I so won. You did not let me do that, did you?",
        "Coop: No. That actually wasn't part of the deal. You just won fair and square.",
        "Lizzie: Good. Let's play again.",
        "Coop: I'm still on the clock. Why not? Um...",
        "Lizzie: You're still on the clock? Is that why you're playing with me? Or do you really want to play with me? No, you said, \"that wasn't part of the deal.\" So, what? Are you just hanging out with me because my aunt alex bribed you to, coop? Is that the only reason why you're here?",
        "Coop: No. Lizzie, look, you're looking at this all wrong here. And why are you even bringing that up in the first place? I mean, I was the one that dragged you to come out. You know, except for the fact your granddad came and...",
        "Lizzie: You know what? Thank god he did. He had my best interests at heart. You can leave, okay? I'll have one of my real friends come pick me up.",
        "Coop: Fine. Good luck with that.",
        "Lizzie: I'll show you, henry, that I don't need to settle for a guy like you.",
        "Jeffrey: Hm. Do yourself a favor, okay? Stay away from cassie.",
        "Jonathan: Or what?",
        "Jeffrey: I know people. They can make you disappear just because I ask them to.",
        "Jonathan: Ooh. Edmund's right. You've really got it bad for aunt cassie.",
        "Jeffrey: Stop.",
        "Jonathan: Hey, she's hot. I don't blame you. I'd go for her myself, but you know, we're related.",
        "Jeffrey: Walk away, kid.",
        "Jonathan: Why shouldn't you get the girl? You've got the whole \"looks like the dead love of her life\" thing going for you.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah.",
        "Jonathan: Tell me you don't want her and I'll shut up.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay. I'm not going to deny it. I do. So the next time you feel the urge to mess with her, just remember how I feel about her.",
        "Jonathan: She's all yours, man. Don't say I never gave you anything.",
        "Edmund: You don't need to be afraid of me, cassie. I'd never hurt you.",
        "Cassie: I know that.",
        "Edmund: Then stay. Just please stay. Let me explain.",
        "Cassie: Edmund, there's nothing that you're going to say to me that is going to make me understand what you did.",
        "Edmund: I know.",
        "Cassie: You could have killed jeffrey, rj, me.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, there is no excuse for what I did. There's nothing. I just... I was out of my mind that night. I hadn't slept. There was the storm going on, and I kept seeing you and jeffrey o'neill together. But cassie, I could never commit an act of violence like that again. I couldn'T.",
        "Cassie: Edmund, you already have. Your anger is out of control. It's taken over you. Cassie. I can change if you just give me a chance.",
        "Cassie: I don't want you changing for me, edmund. I want you to change for yourself.",
        "Edmund: But cassie, I've never wanted anything more. Look, we're husband and wife. I committed my life to you, for the rest of my life, and i thought you did the same.",
        "Cassie: The man I married doesn't exist. I don't think he ever did.",
        "Edmund: But cassie, cassie, you still love me. I can see it in your eyes.",
        "Cassie: Love isn't enough.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, please don'T... don't let one terrible thing I did, terrible thing, destroy everything we have together. If it hadn't been for this, we'd be on our way to a clinic. We'd be taking the next step to having this child together, cassie.",
        "Cassie: I can'T... I can't do this.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, please. Please just... I love you. I know... I know our love can carry us through all this. It can carry us through today and tomorrow. It can carry us through the rest of our lives. Just trust me. I promise you.",
        "Cassie: I love you. But I can't be with you, edmund. I can'T.",
        "Edmund: I'll never give up on us, cassie. Never.",
        "Reva: Well, I guess you're not interested in hearing my side of what happened.",
        "Josh: Are you suggesting i can't trust jonathan's version of the story?",
        "Reva: Jonathan doesn't understand everything.",
        "Josh: He seemed very clear to me. He told me about your little tag-team thing you got going on. You set them up, he knocks them down, right?",
        "Reva: Oh, well, I guess the verdict's in, huh? Guilty as charged.",
        "Josh: Why do you even care about what I think, reva?",
        "Reva: ( Sighs )",
        "Josh: I asked you to wait and think about things before you talked to edmund. You agreed to that. Next thing I know, cassie's life is in shambles.",
        "Reva: I'm sorry she found out the way she did, but I'm glad she found out, because what if she'd gotten pregnant with edmund's child?",
        "Josh: You can't even admit that you made a mistake by going to jeffrey, can you?",
        "Reva: I had to do something.",
        "Josh: Did you?",
        "Reva: I always fight for the people I love. That's who I am. And I love my sister and i wanted to protect her. I'm not going to change. I never will.",
        "Josh: I really hope you don't mean that.",
        "Reva: I haven't changed. I'm still the same woman you fell in love with. I still follow my heart, first, last, and always.",
        "Josh: Okay. You're right, you are the woman that I fell in love with. The problem is, sometimes i can't live with you. Next, on \"guiding light.\"",
        "Olivia: I need your help. You were there when alan threatened to rip my life apart, alexandra. He's starting to make good on it, and I know this is just the beginning. I know it. I can feel it. He's going to try and take emma away from me.",
        "Harley: I'm choosing to believe in you again. Don't make me live to regret this."
