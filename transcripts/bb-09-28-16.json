        "Ridge tells his dad that the word betrayal is a very big word. Eric says you cannot call it anything else. He asked them to come and see him stand before God and family to unite with the woman he loves and they could not do that. This is no family. One by one they try to explain why they did not come and how cruel this must seem to him. Hurt written all over his face, Eric says he does understand. They were trying to make him not feel the way he truly feels and give up on a woman who has given him nothing but devotion. Steffy says Quinn is dangerous; she is only faking it. Pam adds that Quinn has a mean streak. Eric scoffs that there seems to be a pretty wide mean streak running right through this room just now. And that mean Quinn told him not to marry her if the family was going to act this way. She came down those stairs and saw the hurt in his eyes and this mean, vicious, selfish woman was willing to give up her own happiness for him. So he does not want any of them to say she is a danger to him or any of them. He never wants to hear that again. Quinn too is hurt. She tells Wyatt that he was not there for her. He says the reason was his love for Steffy and how she felt, so he did not come. Any other man and he would have. She says a tiny part of her is proud of him standing by his wife; she only hopes he gets a few points for that. And she adds that she has never seen Eric be so disappointed. Not one of his family could support him. No one could be happy for them. And Steffy has not shown one ounce of telling Wyatt that she will move back in with him so that should tell him something. He says he does not know what will happen but he does know he will not give up. Pam says again they were only worried about Eric with Quinn's history. Eric says everybody in this room has a history. And if memory serves Pam certainly had her own and he forgave her otherwise she would not be standing in this room right now. He opines that he took her in and yesterday she walked out on him. Then he starts in on Zende how he took him in, never considered him going anyplace else as he told Kristen he would look after him. Now he is disappointed in him that he was not there yesterday to welcome in another new Forrester. He turns to Maya and asks why she wasn't there. He welcomed her into the family, and even her sister and entire family with all their drama lots of drama but that didn't matter as he saw in Rick's eyes the love he had for her. But they had nothing but hatred for him. They never bothered to look in his eyes and see the love he had for Quinn. He remarks that Rick asks and asks for things and the one time that Eric asks something they cannot do it. As all hang their head in shame he repeats they let him down; none of them came to his wedding the only thing that he asked.",
        "Quinn tells Wyatt that she is not going to try to exclude any of them, Ridge or Steffy, but she is going to protect Eric as best she can. They can join her if they like but they better understand something. She is now Mrs. Eric Forrester and there is not a thing they can do to change that. Thorne tells his dad that he knows they have a lot to make up for and they will .he promises him that. Eric does not know how. He laments that Thorne promised to be his best man. He could have said no, instead of saying yes and then just not showing up. He tells Thorne that he doesn't even know Quinn. All he knows is the lies that Ridge and Steffy have filled his head with. And Thomas, he is surprised that he is going along with this mob mentality, just following what Ridge and Steffy say is right for him but they are wrong. He shouts at Steffy that she said in Monte Carlo that she forbid it; channeling her namesake and showing her strong willed stubbornness. Thank God he did not go along with that. She did not ask how he felt about Quinn. It was all about Steffy and her demands. Then he tells Ridge to stop it. He has been taking care of him longer than anyone else .since he was big enough to crawl around in here on his hands and knees with a pencil in his hand. He saw then that he had talent and that talent grew into confidence but that into arrogance. But that is a Marone thing, being the strongest man in the room. Ridge says he is not going to do this. He is not going to let his dad berate him the way he did everybody else. He did what he did because Eric's relationship with Quinn is wrong and somewhere in there he knows that too. She is not worthy of him. Eric says Ridge does not get to decide that, only he does. King Ridge does not get to tell everyone in this room how Eric feels about his own wife. Ridge says he only controls who he respects and he does not respect a single things about that horrible woman. Eric picks up papers from his desk and says he will have to respect Quinn now. As soon as he signs those papers she will be Mrs. Eric Forrester. Thorne warns Eric to calm down. Ridge starts to walk out and Eric tells him to come back; he is not finished yet. He reminds him how alone he was when Stephanie died but he does not need their protection now. Just think how he had to look into Quinn's eyes and her see the hurt when she realized how little his family felt about him. Quinn and Wyatt hear raised voices and rush in just to find Eric who has collapsed to the floor with all rushing to his side."

        "Ridge: I betrayed you. \"Betrayed\" -- that's a big word.",
        "Eric: What else would you call it, what you did to me? What you all did to me? You had a chance to support me, to come and witness me committing my life to another person, saying vows in front of God and family. Family. There is no family. You weren't there.",
        "Steffy: We did it because of Quinn. We wanted you to see how we feel about her.",
        "Eric: And what happened instead? I saw how you feel about me.",
        "Quinn: The most important day of my life, and my son wasn't there.",
        "Wyatt: Hate to break it to you, but I was definitely there when you gave birth. I'm sorry. I was just trying to lighten the mood.",
        "Quinn: You've always been my main focus.",
        "Wyatt: Until Eric.",
        "Quinn: And that's different. You should understand because of how you feel about Steffy.",
        "Wyatt: I do understand. That's the thing. My feelings for Steffy are what kept me away from your most important day of your life.",
        "Quinn: Both of you should have been there.",
        "Wyatt: Any other man. Any -- hell, even deacon. I would have been there.",
        "Quinn: You know what? There's a very, very, very small part of me that is proud of you for standing by your wife's side.",
        "Wyatt: Well, okay.",
        "Quinn: And I hope -- I hope you got points for that. I have never seen Eric like that. I don't think he's ever experienced that kind of disappointment in his life. To be completely abandoned by his family. Not one of them -- not one of them tried to be happy for us.",
        "Wyatt: Well, there's a -- there's a very, very, very small part of me that wants to try, if that counts for anything.",
        "Quinn: It's a start.",
        "Quinn: Did Steffy say \"thank you\" at least?",
        "Wyatt: For what?",
        "Quinn: For putting her selfish needs before me?",
        "Wyatt: [Scoffs] Is it that selfish she wanted to keep you away from her grandfather, after everything that you've done, mom? I told her that I was gonna protect her from you, protect her family. I told her that I was gonna keep you away from the Forresters, and then what happened? You married her grandfather.",
        "Quinn: She married you. Not that you'd know that based on her behavior.",
        "Wyatt: [Scoffs]",
        "Quinn: I mean -- [Scoffs] She moves out, she's stringing you along.",
        "Wyatt: That's not what she's doing, mom.",
        "Quinn: You didn't go to your own mother's wedding for her, and yet, she hasn't even given you the slightest indication whether she's moving back in. So what does that say to you?",
        "Wyatt: You think she's going back to Liam, don't you?",
        "Quinn: Do you?",
        "Wyatt: I don't know. All I know is that I'll never give up on her.",
        "Rick: You don't mean that. Dad, you know how much you mean to all of us.",
        "Eric: I do now.",
        "Thorne: Dad, please, don't say it like that.",
        "Eric: Well, how would you have me say it, Thorne? After what you've all done to me?",
        "Maya: We can all see now how cruel this must seem, but you have to understand...",
        "Eric: Maya, I understand. I know what you were all trying to do. You were forcing me -- you were trying to force me not to feel something that I feel. To convince me to give up on a woman who's given me nothing -- nothing but devotion.",
        "Steffy: That's what you're not getting! She's faking it! She's dangerous!",
        "Pam: Eric. Eric. It's -- it's her history. Quinn has a mean streak. We were all just trying to protect you from her.",
        "Eric: A mean streak? There's a pretty wide mean streak running right through this room right now. You know what \"mean\" Quinn said to me? You know what she did when she came down those steps to me? When she looked at that room, and my family wasn't there... she came down the aisle toward me and she saw the hurt in my eyes, and she -- she looked at me and she saw how much it hurt. You know what she said to me? She said, \"don't marry me.\" This awful, awful woman. This selfish, mean woman that you think she is was willing to give up her happiness for mine. So I don't want to hear you say that Quinn fuller -- no, wait -- Quinn Forrester is a danger to me or to any of you. I never want to hear that again.",
        "Wyatt: Things just need to settle down, that's all. Steffy will come home, and then we can get on with our lives.",
        "Quinn: That'll happen sooner than you think now that Eric and I are married.",
        "Wyatt: No. Actually, your marriage has significantly stalled my \"settling down\" process.",
        "Quinn: I don't think so. It proves that I'm not manipulating. It does!",
        "Wyatt: How?",
        "Quinn: Because I told Eric not to marry me.",
        "Wyatt: You really did that?",
        "Quinn: Yeah. But he convinced me otherwise. He talked to me about the effect that I've had on his life, how I have inspired him. And he said despite the fact that his children and his grandchildren weren't there, he still wanted to marry me. That's how much Eric cares about me. Steffy needs to understand that. Maybe now she will. Maybe they all will.",
        "Ridge: [Sighs] Dad. I get it. You trust Quinn. And I get why. Because she always says the right thing at exactly the right time.",
        "Eric: How is it that you're so convinced that every word that comes out of her mouth is duplicitous? That it's malicious? You can't just believe she cares about me?",
        "Pam: Look, Eric, maybe she really does. Maybe she does, and then one day, we will all come to see that. But what we're trying to say to you is that we were worried about you. We were worried about her history, and that's --",
        "Eric: Well, everybody has a history, pam. You have a history, too, don't you? You've got one of your own. I forgave you for that, didn't I?",
        "Pam: Yeah.",
        "Eric: You think that my relationship with Quinn somehow taints your sister's memory, but do you know how many times I had to forgive Stephanie? If I hadn't forgiven you time after time, you wouldn't be standing in this room right now. I took you into this family, and you walked out on me yesterday.",
        "Pam: But -- [Sighs] I... oh, I don't know.",
        "Eric: And what about you, Zende? I took you in, too. Doesn't that count for something?",
        "Zende: Of course it does.",
        "Eric: It does. Good. I'm glad to hear it. Your mother asked me to look after you, to watch over you, and so I have. It never occurred to me that you'd live anywhere else. I'm your granddad. I welcomed you into this family. Have you ever felt anything but welcome?",
        "Zende: No.",
        "Eric: Okay. I welcomed Quinn into our family yesterday, and you weren't there. I'm disappointed in you. I'm so disappointed that you weren't there. To help me welcome a new Forrester wife into this family.",
        "Zende: I'm sorry.",
        "Eric: Why weren't you there? I mean, have you ever felt anything but welcome in this family?",
        "Maya: No.",
        "Eric: Okay, so I welcomed you into the family, and your sisters -- both of them -- your mom and dad. All the drama. Lots of drama. But it didn't matter because I saw in his eyes... I saw how much he loved you, how much you meant to him. So I welcomed you in. You can't see that in my eyes about how I feel about Quinn? Did anybody bother to look in my face and see how I feel about her? No. This was hateful. Neither one of you has any right to do this. After everything I've done for you.",
        "Rick: I know.",
        "Eric: You think that, uh, I owe you something because you think that I favor Ridge all the time so you want me to make you feel better about that? Well, it's simply not the truth. And you beg me to treat you differently than I do. And over again, you ask and ask and ask, and I give and give and give, and then I ask one thing of you, and you don't come.",
        "Rick: I don't know what to say. No, actually, I do know what to say. I'm worried.",
        "Eric: You know how many times I've worried about you? But I've always stood beside you. I've always stood with you. I've never disagreed. I asked you to come to my wedding -- one thing. You weren't there. You didn't come to my wedding!",
        "Wyatt: I wouldn't count on understanding from Steffy, or any of the Forresters for that matter. They think you are hurting Eric. They were trying to protect him.",
        "Quinn: They were protecting him? They were protecting him? They betrayed him! You know what, though? His pain is over now. It's done. He doesn't need to worry about it anymore. You want to know why? Because I'm in his life. I am his wife now, and I am going to protect him. I'm gonna take care of him. And you know what? They can all join me. I'm not trying to exclude anyone. Ridge, Steffy, all of them -- they can join me in caring for Eric. But they need to understand something. I'm part of this family. I am Mrs. Eric Forrester, and there is nothing they can do to change that.",
        "Thorne: Dad. We obviously have a lot to make up to you, and we will, okay? I promise you that.",
        "Eric: How? How are you gonna do that? I thought I could depend on you. I thought I could ask you to be my best man and you would show up. Why didn't you just say no? Why didn't you just say no instead of pretending to support me?",
        "Thorne: I was not pretending, dad! I wanted to be there for you.",
        "Eric: Until when? Until Ridge and Steffy talked you out of it?",
        "Thorne: Dad, we're all concerned --",
        "Eric: No, you don't even know Quinn! You don't even know her! All you've got in your head about her are the lies that they've filled your head with.",
        "Steffy: They're not lies. We told Thorne what she does. It's the truth.",
        "Eric: No, what she did. You're not telling him what she does now, what she means to me, the changes she's made in my life. Does that matter to you at all?",
        "Thorne: Of course it matters! You know it matters to me.",
        "Eric: What about you, Thomas? Does that matter to you? At all? I'm a little surprised by you, that you would take part in this. I thought you were the kind of guy that kind of made up his own mind, but I guess not. You just kind of bought into the mob mentality, no second thoughts.",
        "Thomas: I should have talked to you.",
        "Eric: Yeah, you should have talked to me. You all should have talked to me, but nobody did. Nobody did. Nobody wanted to ask the doddering old man. You thought that Steffy and Ridge could tell everybody what was right for me. Wrong.",
        "Quinn: It shouldn't have been this way. It should have been a big family wedding. With dancing and toasts and cutting the cake and joyful speeches. Why? Why couldn't they do that for him?",
        "Wyatt: 'Cause it was you, mom.",
        "Quinn: Because it was me. They made him suffer.",
        "[Indistinct shouting]",
        "Quinn: What was that?",
        "Wyatt: It sounded like Eric.",
        "Eric: \"I forbid it,\" you said. You remember when you said that to me in Monte Carlo? \"I absolutely forbid it!\" Channeling your namesake. Stubborn and strong-willed. Thank God I didn't go along with it.",
        "Steffy: Granddad. You should have.",
        "Eric: I should -- no, you should have. You should have asked me how I was feeling about what I was doing, how I felt about Quinn, and what she meant in my life. But no, no. You just made demands. It was all about you! [Muffled] All about Steffy!",
        "Wyatt: Okay, that was definitely Eric.",
        "Quinn: Yelling.",
        "Wyatt: Are you sure you don't want to go in there?",
        "Eric: Steffy, I understand that you have issues with Quinn. Big issues. But those are in the past. Who are you to say that she doesn't deserve a second chance?",
        "Steffy: This isn't Quinn's second chance. Quinn has had millions of chances. Okay, fine. Maybe I'm like my grandmother. Maybe I'm so demanding, but I'm doing this out of concern for you because I'm looking out for you.",
        "Eric: You're looking out for me?",
        "Steffy: Yeah.",
        "Eric: Oh, because I'm this old man, this feeble old guy who can't really take care of himself. Well, you know what? Maybe that's a quality all of you should try to emulate. All of you. Especially you. Oh, stop it. Stop it. I've been taking care of you longer than anybody else, anybody else in this room. You used to crawl around in here on your hands and knees with a pencil marking up all my good work. Drawing on it. Ridge, you were talented. I saw talent. I had no idea how much. My God. And all that talent evolved into great, great confidence. And then arrogance. That's a Marone thing, you know? You and Massimo both crave being the strongest man in the room. Is that what this is about? Me taking over the CEO position again?",
        "Ridge: Dad, Dad, for you to even think that proves that we were right. I think you're -- I --",
        "Eric: What, you think I'm losing it? Is that what you're saying? Is that what you think this proves?",
        "Ridge: I'm not doing this with you. I'm not -- I'm not -- I'm not gonna let you berate me like you do everybody else. I did what I did because your relationship with Quinn is wrong, and somewhere in there, you know that's true. She's not worthy of you.",
        "Eric: You don't get to decide that. You don't decide that. I decide that. You don't get to tell everybody in this room what they need to feel. King Ridge doesn't get to tell everybody how they feel about me and my wife. You don't control me.",
        "Ridge: I control who I respect! And I don't respect a single thing about that horrible woman.",
        "Eric: Well, you're gonna have to respect her. You have to respect her now, because when I signed this, she is Mrs. Eric Forrester. I'm married now! She and I are going on our honeymoon. You will respect her.",
        "Thorne: Dad. Dad. Just calm down, okay?",
        "Eric: You ask me to calm down? I need to calm down? When all of you -- all of you abandoned me like this? My eldest son pulls off some kind of magical coup, and you want me to relax about that? Not -- not on your life.",
        "Quinn: I can't take it. I don't care if I make things worse. I can't let him face them alone.",
        "Eric: Ridge, I'm not finished! Come here! When your mother died, I was by myself. I didn't like it very much, and it went on for a long time, and then Quinn came along and she made my life a lot better. I like it. You can't change that. You have to respect that. How can you take that away from me?",
        "Ridge: We're trying to protect you!",
        "Eric: I don't need that! I want you to support me! I want you to believe in me! You know what it was like for me to see her look into my eyes and to see how little my family cared about me?",
        "Ridge: You don't know the first thing about any of us.",
        "Eric: You made me feel alone!",
        "Steffy: Granddad! Granddad!",
        "Pam: Eric!",
        "Rick: Dad! Are you all right?",
        "Thorne: What happened?",
        "Quinn: Eric!"
