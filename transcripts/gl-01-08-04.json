        "Edmund forces Cassie to look backwards in time, to the night of the accident when she lost her baby. At first resistant to the memories flooding upon her, Cassie grows more emotional remembering against her will details of the frightening night she drove the car off the road. Edmund makes clear to her that he never meant to harm her. Cassie, to his growing horror, starts to blame herself, realizing that her own reckless driving and defiant attitude during a high-risk pregnancy were contributing causes. She asks his forgiveness for having been so sanctimonious in scapegoating him and Edmund freely gives it. After the talk they are more at peace, but Cassie asks Edmund if he was at the hospital the night the baby miscarried? He wonders why she's asking but she hides the hidden thought with \"no reason.\" Reva shows up at Josh's hotel room with a comfort basket of videos and movie snack food. Josh is surprised to see her and, out of loyalty to his men friends, resists her company. But she charms her way past his many defenses and is cuddling in his arms when she shares with him the vision she had recently of his drowning. Josh now remembers his need to keep her at a distance, and resists her attempted seduction. Reva exits with dignity, but it is only when alone in the hall do we see how devastated she is by this turn of events.",
        "Rick notices Michelle's bruise. She at first gives him a cover story, only telling him the truth when he wonders if Danny did this to her. Michelle tells him finally that it was Ed, and they share their mutual anxiety over his condition. Michelle tells him of the medical error concerning Shayne. Rick promises not to tell Danny and to keep an eye on Ed. Ed meanwhile freezes in the ER when confronted with a half-drowned woman who reminds him of Maryanne. Rick handles the medical crisis but strongly warns Ed he will not enable him in whatever's wrong. Ed denies he's drinking and freely offers to take a blood test. However, Rick is more worried about his dad than ever. Michelle meanwhile has sought the comfort of Danny's presence in Company, where he had watched Ross announce his bid for mayor. Bill and Danny discuss the upcoming fight. Neither Bill nor Danny will back down, and they agree to work on accomplishing great things together. When Michelle enters, she lies about the bruise. She voices to Danny her appreciation for the true security and love he's offered her. They go home, very much a team and in love."

        "Reva: Hey. What's with the \"PRIVACY, PLEASE\" sign?",
        "Josh: I was sleeping. Why are you here?",
        "Reva: Well, just think of me as your personal room service. (Laughs) I have a bottle of barola. I have popcorn, and I have three new DVD releases. One comedy, one drama, scary movie and one that tends to be a little steamy.",
        "Josh: Reva...",
        "Reva: Don't say \u0091no.' Please don't say to \u0091no' to any of this. To this stuff, to me, because I really don't think I can handle another disappointment today.",
        "Rick: Hey.",
        "Michelle: Hey.",
        "Rick: Run another serum calcium on Mr. Goldwin in Room 12. And just check those levels later on for me.",
        "Michelle: Sure, sure. Right away.",
        "Rick: Hey. What's going on with your face?",
        "Michelle: Hmm?",
        "Rick: How'd you get that bruise on your face?",
        "Michelle: What, this? Oh, please, it's nothing.",
        "Rick: No, no, I'll be the judge of that, young lady.",
        "Michelle: No, Rick, it's really nothing.",
        "Rick: Come here under the lights so I can take a look at this. This looks like somebody punched you in the face about 24 hours ago.",
        "Michelle: A homeless patient was admitted last night and he was schizophrenic, he was off his meds. I guess he saw me coming towards him in my white coat and I just...",
        "Rick: You're lying. Try again.",
        "Michelle: Excuse me? I'm not lying.",
        "Rick: Michelle, you're lying. You're biting your bottom lip, you've done it ever since you were seven-years-old. So let's try again. How did you get the bruise on your face? The truth this time.",
        "Michelle: I just told you. I just told you. Why would I lie?",
        "Rick: That's what I'm trying to find --",
        "Michelle: Who else would possibly hit me?",
        "Rick: Well, that's what I'm trying to find out. Did... did Danny hit you in the face?",
        "Michelle: No. Why would you even think that?",
        "Rick: Well, if it wasn't Danny, who the hell hit you in the face?",
        "Michelle: Okay, it was Dad. All right, Dad. Dad hit me.",
        "Cassie: If I start talking about what happened...",
        "Edmund: About how you lost the baby.",
        "Cassie: ...I'm afraid I'm going to say something that I can't take back. Losing a baby isn't something you just get over.",
        "Edmund: That's my point exactly.",
        "Cassie: But I don't blame you, Edmund. You know, I'm like over that, okay?",
        "Edmund: No, you're not. Because if you were, Cassie, you wouldn't be so hell- bent on avoiding the subject entirely. You'd express your feelings to me, share them with the man you love. Because you love me, right, Cassie?",
        "Cassie: Yes, Edmund, I do, and that's why I don't need to do this. Okay?",
        "Edmund: Cassie, don't think this is going to go away, because it's not. It's going to crop up again and again until it tears us apart. I mean, is that what you want, Cassie?",
        "Cassie: No. I just want some air right now.",
        "Edmund: No, Cassie. Is that what you want?",
        "Cassie: Edmund, please stop! I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that. I...",
        "Edmund: Yes. Yes, you did. You did, Cassie. Because as much as you may love me, you hate me, too. That's why we have to face this. Cassie, we have to confront what happened to you and your baby that night -- we have to -- and the part I played in it.",
        "Rick: Excuse me. Excuse me. Why would Dad hit you?",
        "Michelle: Look, it wasn't his fault, Rick, okay? I provoked him. You know how stressed he's been and I was questioning him about something that was very personal and painful.",
        "Rick: Did you ask him if he was drinking again?",
        "Michelle: That was... that was part of it, and he denied it.",
        "Rick: Uh-huh. And you didn't believe him, right?",
        "Michelle: I just... I thought that he was hiding something from me so I kept digging at him, just way past where I should have, and he just couldn't take it anymore.",
        "Rick: Michelle. Michelle, sweetie, listen to me. I don't care how much you got him upset, okay? Under no circumstances -- listen to me -- under no circumstances is our father allowed to hit you in the face. Do you understand?",
        "Michelle: Rick, look, he's really upset about it, okay? He is. And we're over it. The whole thing is behind us.",
        "Rick: No, we're not going to do that.",
        "Michelle: Yes, Rick.",
        "Rick: We're not.",
        "Michelle: And you have to forget that we even had this discussion.",
        "Rick: I can't do that, Michelle. If we make excuses for him now, what is he going to do next?",
        "Michelle: Rick, you're not listening to me. There were extenuating circumstances.",
        "Rick: There's always extenuating circumstances for alcoholics, always excuses. That's why they keep on drinking.",
        "Michelle: He's not drinking again.",
        "Rick: Something's going on. So the three of us are going to sit down and we're going to do deal with this today.",
        "Michelle: No, Rick. No, no. It's going to only make things worse. Please.",
        "Rick: Okay, fine. Then what are we going to do, Michelle?",
        "Michelle: I don't know. I don't know, okay? I just have to think about it, okay? And while I'm thinking, you have to promise me something.",
        "Rick: Sorry, I don't know if I can do that.",
        "Michelle: Rick, you have to promise me that you won't say anything to Danny about this. Danny cannot know that Dad did this to me.",
        "Ross: Ladies and gentlemen, I have lived and practiced law in Springfield for over 20 years and each year, I have done extensive pro bono work for the courts and I currently serve on the board of several local charities.",
        "Bill: Laying it on thick, aren't we, Ross?",
        "Ross: Because of that, I have a greater understanding of the needs and concerns of all of our citizens, and I have the knowledge and the experience to make sure that those concerns will be heard. Now, over the years, three times you have elected me to serve as your district attorney and I served each term with great pride. And I'm honored to say that Springfield overwhelmingly voted for me when I ran for the United States Senate.",
        "(Cheers and applause)",
        "Bill: Wow. One lousy senate race where you won and you gave up your seat.",
        "Danny: (Sighs)",
        "Ross: It is with a great deal of pride and pleasure that I officially announce my candidacy for mayor of the great city of Springfield.",
        "(Cheers and applause)",
        "Danny: Look who's standing to the left of Ross: Daggert and Hodge.",
        "Bill: Those snakes. They said they were going to endorse you.",
        "Danny: Yeah, they said maybe. Obviously they changed their minds. I've seen enough. You know, Daggert and Hodge practically control the Chamber of Commerce. That's a whole lot of support swinging towards Ross.",
        "Bill: Danny, who cares? That makes our job a little harder. Big deal.",
        "Danny: Bill... thank you. Ross has friends on the state level, too.",
        "Bill: Well, you know what? You've got friends on the street and that, my friend, is where the voters are.",
        "Danny: Yeah. Bill, listen. I really appreciate the loyalty that you've shown. You've been great. But if you want to bail out, now's the time to say so, no hard feelings.",
        "Bill: Now, why would I do that?",
        "Danny: (Sighs) Well, for one thing, unlike me, you actually have a reputation to uphold. Your last name commands some respect in this town.",
        "Reva: Well, I never. But there's a first time for everything. Come on. Come on. Ooh. Ooh, this is so comfy. Well, it's a start. Popcorn?",
        "Edmund: I had you under house arrest, you were in your suite. You managed to escape. I sent the guards out after you, but you got off the palace grounds, you made it down to the Old Beach Road.",
        "Cassie: It's over, Edmund. I don't want to relive this.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, Richard and Noah and Reva were waiting for you in the car, but they had no idea that my men were chasing you. Come on. Were you scared? Cassie, you must have been scared.",
        "Cassie: Okay, I was scared, Edmund! I was scared! Are you happy now?",
        "Edmund: Were you scared of me?",
        "Cassie: I was scared of what you were capable of!",
        "Edmund: It's the same thing. It's the same thing, Cassie. You and Reva got into the car. You got behind the wheel. What were you thinking? What were you thinking that exact moment?",
        "Cassie: That I have to get away. I had to get away.",
        "Edmund: Cassie?",
        "Cassie: I can't do this.",
        "Edmund: You have to do this, Cassie. We have to do this. Please.",
        "Cassie: Why? Because it's going to make you feel better? You're going to unload some guilt? Because this is about you and what you want, and you didn't give a damn about me back then, and you still don't now. I was pregnant, for God's sake. I had a life growing inside of me, and did you care? No! Because you hunted me through the jungle like I was some kind of animal.",
        "Edmund: Yes, I did.",
        "Bill: Are you calling me a quitter, Danny?",
        "Danny: No, Bill, I'm not calling you a quitter.",
        "Bill: Do you think I'm afraid of a fight? Yes, Ross Marler will be a tough opponent, but all that means is the taste of victory will be that much sweeter when we do.",
        "Danny: You mean \u0091if' we do.",
        "Bill: No, I mean \u0091when' we do. Now, come on, Danny. You know that I have a personal stake in getting you elected. It's, like, a pride thing for me. I have something to prove to my Uncle Josh and my dad that I can be a player on my own terms.",
        "Danny: And Eden, too.",
        "Bill: Sure. It never hurts to impress the girlfriend. But mostly, you want to know the real reason why I've been working my butt off 24/7 for you? Because I think you're going to make a fine mayor and together we can do a lot of good in this town -- at least that's what I thought until you started talking like a wimp, like, \"I don't know if I can win this campaign, because people aren't...\" Unless, of course, this whole thing has been a test.",
        "Danny: Maybe.",
        "Bill: Maybe?",
        "Danny: Maybe. Maybe.",
        "Bill: Yeah, well, if it is a test, did I pass? Can we get back to business?",
        "Danny: Bill, I just need to make sure that your heart's really in this, because it's going to take everything we've got and then some, if we're going to beat Ross Marler.",
        "Bill: Well, whatever it takes, I am there.",
        "Danny: Okay, then. Let the games begin.",
        "Michelle: If Danny knew about this, he'd want to confront Dad right away and he'd just make things worse.",
        "Rick: All right, I'm not going to talk to Danny, but I am going to talk to Dad. Not just about slapping you in the face, Michelle, which is bad enough as it is. He's been acting strange since long before the holidays, so we need to take care of this, we need to address it right now. I mean, Michelle, we're doctors. We hold people's lives in our hands. We can't afford for Dad to screw up.",
        "Michelle: I know that, okay? (Sighs) I know.",
        "Rick: What do you know? What do you know?",
        "Michelle: Look, the other day, Dad almost gave Shayne Lewis the wrong meds. They were just pain meds, so it wouldn't have had an adverse effect.",
        "Rick: That's it, I'm talking to him. I have to talk to him right now.",
        "Michelle: Okay, look, Rick, just please... just don't mention this. Just keep it on a professional level, okay?",
        "Rick: I'm going to say what I have to say to get through to him.",
        "Michelle: Rick, don't be hard on him. I'm telling you, he's in a lot of pain right now.",
        "Rick: Michelle, is there something you're not telling me?",
        "Michelle: No!",
        "Rick: Are you sure?",
        "Michelle: He's just... he's just hurting, that's all.",
        "Rick: I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. You're upset, you've been through a lot. I want you to go home. Your schedule's...",
        "Michelle: No, I don't need...",
        "Rick: I want you to...",
        "Michelle: I'm fine.",
        "Rick: I want you to take care of yourself. Why don't you go home and take it easy. I want you to stay away from Dad for right now until we figure this thing out. Okay?",
        "Michelle: Okay.",
        "Rick: All right.",
        "Michelle: Okay, but Rick, you've got to promise me about Dad.",
        "Rick: I love him too, Michelle. I just want to help him.",
        "Michelle: Okay.",
        "Rick: Okay?",
        "Michelle: Okay.",
        "Rick: All right.",
        "Nurse: Dr. Bauer? Sorry. In here, please. The EMTs brought her in. She fell through the ice on the river. It took 25 minutes to get her out. She lost consciousness on the way here. She's got shallow, bilateral breath sounds with some wheezing at the bottom. BP is 85 over 50. Pulse is 45. Temperature is 32-point... Dr. Bauer, she's hypothermic. We have to bring up her core temp. I'm just going to go to external warming -- if that's okay? Dr. Bauer? Dr. Bauer?",
        "Reva: Okay, so what's the verdict? Something outrageously funny or outrageously scary or outrageously steamy? (Laughs)",
        "Josh: Why don't you choose?",
        "Reva: You sure?",
        "Josh: Yeah. Like I said, I'm very tired right now. I don't know that I really care.",
        "Reva: You know, I'm a little tired, too. Now, see? This is much better than a movie.",
        "Josh: Yes, it is. So, um, are you going to go back to the hospital later and be with Shayne?",
        "Reva: I don't think so. He made it pretty clear that he needed some time alone. And I don't want to push him. I don't want to give him a whole lot of room, either.",
        "Josh: It must be difficult for you, seeing him so...",
        "Reva: Depressed. Because that's what it is, he's depressed. Not that he doesn't have reason to be.",
        "Josh: He's always been so positive about everything in his life. But he'll be okay. He's just a little disheartened. He'll bounce back. He always does. What is it?",
        "Reva: Maybe that's what I saw.",
        "Josh: You saw when?",
        "Reva: The other day at the hospital, I had a vision or a whatever. And I thought I was seeing Shayne, but then it turned out to be you, and I'm thinking maybe I replaced you with him because of the burden that you've been carrying since Shayne's accident, emotionally.",
        "Josh: What exactly did you see?",
        "Reva: Swirling water. Someone drowning.",
        "Edmund: Come on, Cassie. Keep going.",
        "Cassie: No, Edmund.",
        "Edmund: All right. If you won't, I will. I was furious that you'd gotten out of the palace, I was furious that you escaped, so I went after you with my men. Not to harm you, but to bring you back -- to bring you back.",
        "Edmund: I have a roadblock in place. All right, they're coming. They're heading straight for us. Be careful, I don't want any mishaps.",
        "Edmund: Not that my intentions matter at this juncture -- nor should they; the end result is still the same -- but the important thing, Cassie, is that you thought I would do you harm and I had never given you any reason to think otherwise.",
        "Cassie: You were... you were waving your arms, Edmund.",
        "Edmund: To get you to stop.",
        "Cassie: Yes. But your men, they had guns in their hands.",
        "Edmund: Yes, they did.",
        "Cassie: And they were pointed at us.",
        "Edmund: You had no reason to think anything other than the worst of me, Cassie. But still, to me -- to me -- I couldn't believe that you wouldn't stop. I had no idea that you were that scared of me, that you were that desperate, that...",
        "Cassie: Why?",
        "Edmund: Why? Why did I do such a selfish, disgusting thing? Because...",
        "Cassie: Why was I in the car, Edmund? Why was I driving the car?",
        "Edmund: What?",
        "Cassie: You said yourself that you didn't want to hurt me and you were trying to get me to slow down, and then after the crash... ...you risked your own life to save me. I would have died in that accident if it weren't for you.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, no.",
        "Cassie: And then you made sure Reva and I were rushed to the hospital.",
        "Edmund: Cassie...",
        "Cassie: It wasn't your fault, Edmund.",
        "Edmund: Yes, it was my fault.",
        "Cassie: All the time, I have been blaming you, but it wasn't your fault.",
        "Edmund: Cassie... Cassie, you're looking at this whole thing all wrong.",
        "Cassie: No, I'm not! Edmund, look. I was eight months pregnant and I climbed out of the window in the palace. I was running through the jungle from palace guards.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, I sent them after you.",
        "Cassie: Did you tell me to get behind the wheel, Edmund? Did you? Did you make me drive the car? Why didn't I let Reva drive the car if I was so concerned about my child? I was driving 70 miles an hour and I looked up and I saw the roadblock and I saw these guns pointed at me and I just freaked!",
        "Edmund: Cassie, don't do this to yourself. Please, it's not...",
        "Cassie: No, because if you want to get to the truth, then let's get to the truth! I am responsible for my baby boy being dead. I am just as responsible as you are.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, darling, please. Please, just listen.",
        "Cassie: Why didn't I stop the car? Why didn't I stop the car, Edmund? I mean, if I would have, my baby would have been alive right now. I loved him so much and it was my job to protect him, and if I would have done what I should have done...",
        "Edmund: Cassie, please, please, don't do this to yourself. Please... I beg you, Cassie, don't. Just stop. Just, please, listen to me. Listen to me, listen to me. You didn't do anything. You didn't do anything except react with stress and fear to events that I set in motion.",
        "Cassie: Oh, but Edmund...",
        "Edmund: Cassie, listen to me. Listen to me. You didn't do anything. It was my fault. I did it. Everything was my fault. You can't turn this around and let me off the hook, Cassie, you can't. Because I did it. You have to let me accept the blame. Please, Cassie, just let me accept the blame.",
        "Nurse: Dr. Bauer, her BP is dropping. She's going to go into arrest. Can you get me some help here, please?",
        "Rick: I'll take care of this.",
        "Nurse: Oh, thank God.",
        "Rick: What have you got?",
        "Nurse: Near drowning victim. She's hypotensive and bradycardic.",
        "Rick: Temp?",
        "Nurse: 31.2.",
        "Rick: Tympanic?",
        "Nurse: Yes.",
        "Rick: All right. Can she breathe by herself?",
        "Nurse: Yeah.",
        "Rick: Any other visible injuries?",
        "Nurse: No.",
        "Rick: All right, I want you to call respiratory inhalation, rewarming, warming at 150 per hour, do the usual admitting bloods -- ABG and serum K. Notify the ICU right away.",
        "Nurse: You want to prep for a warm gastric lavage?",
        "Rick: No, let's just keep with the warm blanket, all right? I want you to monitor her core temperature, okay?",
        "Nurse: Okay.",
        "Rick: All right, what just happened there? Are you all right?",
        "Ed: Uh... I'm not feeling very well. Maybe you could cover for me.",
        "Rick: I'll cover for you right now, but that's where it ends. I don't know what's going on with you and I haven't pried, but when whatever's going on with you interferes with your judgment and puts people's lives on the line, that's where I draw the line.",
        "Ed: I just told you, I'm not feeling very well.",
        "Rick: Physically? What else is going on with you, Dad?",
        "Ed: I don't want to talk about it.",
        "Rick: No, we are going to talk about it. First, you have my compromise my principles by running a fingerprint test for you. And then you almost give somebody the wrong meds, and then you hit Michelle in the face. What the hell is wrong with you?",
        "Reva: What is it? What's wrong? You look like you just saw a ghost.",
        "Josh: It just... it freaks me out, that's all. You just said you saw a vision of me drowning.",
        "Reva: Well, yeah, but it wasn't literal.",
        "Josh: Are you sure about that?",
        "Reva: Well, I... the more I think about it, the more I really think it's just a metaphor.",
        "Josh: Maybe. (Laughs nervously) Maybe I'll just avoid water for a few days, just in case.",
        "Reva: Joshua, do you feel like you're drowning because of what's going on with Shayne? Or because of something else that's going on?",
        "Josh: I'm just a little overwhelmed right now.",
        "Reva: Okay. You want to talk about it?",
        "Josh: I thought that's what we were doing. Aren't we talking about it right now?",
        "Reva: Yeah. Okay. Just know, Joshua, that I'm here for you, bud. Always. I can be your lifeline, if that's what you want. Just grab hold.",
        "Josh: What if I pull you down with me?",
        "Reva: At least we'll be together.",
        "(Danny and Bill talking quietly)",
        "Michelle: Well, you guys are going to have to cancel all my photo shoots next week, unless black and blue is suddenly trendy.",
        "Danny: What the hell happened to you?",
        "Michelle: Oh, uh, a freaked-out patient came into the ER and I guess I reminded him of somebody.",
        "Danny: When? When did this happen?",
        "Michelle: Last night.",
        "Danny: Why didn't you tell me then?",
        "Michelle: Well you, you know, you got home so late and you were so exhausted and I really didn't think it was that big of a deal until I woke up this morning and I saw this.",
        "Danny: Do you need some ice for that?",
        "Michelle: No, no. I'll do that when I get home.",
        "Bill: Well, how do you want to spin this? \"Do-Gooder Wife Takes It Literally On the Chin?\"",
        "Michelle: No, no, no, Bill. No spin, really. Don't mention it, period. Okay?",
        "Bill: People are going to notice. What are you going to say to them? They're going to ask.",
        "Michelle: Nobody's going to notice. I'm going to put makeup on it, cover it up.",
        "(Cell phone rings)",
        "Bill: Uh, excuse me, guys. I've got to take this, okay?",
        "Danny: I don't believe this. What happened to the guy who hit you? Did hospital security lock him up?",
        "Michelle: No, Danny. He was a troubled person. He really couldn't help himself.",
        "Danny: Man, I was worried about you working at the hot-line. Does it hurt? Looks like it hurts.",
        "Michelle: Nothing that a kiss from you won't make better.",
        "Danny: Okay. I'll be gentle. Oh, poor baby. I'll tell you what, once Bill gets off the phone, why don't we just get out of here and go home, okay?",
        "Michelle: Oh, I like the sound of that.",
        "Danny: Me, too. Me, too. You know, I never knew what a real home was until I met you.",
        "Michelle: You know, I feel the same way, Danny. The life we lead together, it just, it means everything to me.",
        "Ed: All right, look. I mean, I was wrong to hit Michelle. I make no excuses for that. But I don't owe you or anyone else an explanation, Rick.",
        "Rick: Stop this. I love you. So, whatever's bothering you, you need to share it with me so we can deal with it and deal with it right now.",
        "Ed: What has Michelle told you?",
        "Rick: Nothing.",
        "Ed: Come on, she's told you something. What?",
        "Rick: She told me that you slapped her in the face and that she's worried about you.",
        "Ed: So just leave it be.",
        "Rick: Are you drinking?",
        "Ed: I am not drinking.",
        "Rick: Would you tell me if you were drinking?",
        "Ed: Why don't you believe me? Do you want to take a blood alcohol test right now? Come on. You want to do it? Let's go.",
        "Rick: Dad, stop this. Just stop this.",
        "Ed: Stop what? You don't want me to be angry? To be hurt? That my own son doubts my word. Don't worry about it, I'm not. I'll tell you what I am, though: I am tired and I'm worn-out and I am sick of being interrogated by my own children. And if some stinking blood test is going to put an end to that, come on, let's do it. Take my blood, Rick.",
        "Rick: Don't do this here. Don't do this. Why can't you tell me what's wrong with you? Why can't you do that? I'm your son.",
        "Ed: Because I don't want to. And that's my right.",
        "Rick: I am your son. What could possibly be so wrong that you can't share it with me?",
        "Ed: This conversation is over!",
        "Reva: I've waited for this for so long. You've been pulling away from me and I missed you.",
        "Josh: We can't do this right now.",
        "Reva: No, it's fine.",
        "Josh: No, no, this is not a good time, Reva.",
        "Reva: Well, then, let's just concentrate on us.",
        "Josh: No. I really think you should go.",
        "Danny: What's the matter?",
        "Michelle: Nothing. Nothing. I've just been thinking about a lot of stuff lately.",
        "Danny: Stuff? What kind of stuff?",
        "Michelle: Family and what it means.",
        "Danny: What brought all this on? The holidays? The holidays.",
        "Michelle: You know, you have this perfect image of what a family's supposed to look like. But they come in all shapes and sizes now and I guess what really matters is just the love and the respect and the trust. And if you have that, you have everything. And if you don't...",
        "Danny: Yeah, if you don't, you wind up with a mother like mine and spend the rest of your life trying to get past it.",
        "Michelle: We really have gotten past it, Danny.",
        "Danny: You know why? Because of you and Robbie. And you know what I want to do right now?",
        "Michelle: What?",
        "Danny: Go home and be with our son. Give him dinner and a bath and read him his favorite bedtime book for the hundredth time, tuck him in and then cuddle up by the fire with my favorite lady in the whole world for the rest of the night. How's that sound to you?",
        "Michelle: It sounds perfect.",
        "Cassie: Well, we emptied the box. I guess that's a record.",
        "Edmund: Sorry.",
        "Cassie: No, don't be. We needed to deal with this and I need to bear some responsibility.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, don't.",
        "Cassie: No, Edmund, come on. I'm not perfect, you know?",
        "Edmund: Close.",
        "Cassie: No. And you know what? I have a bit of a confession.",
        "Edmund: Oh, goodie. Confessions are good for the soul.",
        "Cassie: When we all found out who Sandy was, I was happy for Reva, but I was a little jealous, too. I mean, she got back her son that she had with Richard, and it's never going to happen for me. Kind of petty, huh?",
        "Edmund: Well, about as petty as Richard offering me an olive branch and me turning it down right before he died.",
        "Cassie: You know, I think that's worse.",
        "Edmund: Thanks.",
        "Cassie: I guess we're human, huh?",
        "Edmund: Yeah. Afraid so. God, I just remember at the hospital, when Richard found out about the baby. The look on his face.",
        "Cassie: You were there, huh? Did, um...",
        "Edmund: What?",
        "Cassie: No, never mind. I don't want to talk about it anymore. I just want to be here with you. (Sighs)",
        "Reva: Well! (Laughs) I believe that's the first time you've ever turned me down.",
        "Josh: It's not about...",
        "Reva: About me. I know, I know that. You keep saying that, but you won't tell me what it is about.",
        "Josh: Reva, I... I want to be with you. I want to make love to you. And I wish that that would just fix everything that we did that...",
        "Reva: Fix what? Fix what? Is it something else? Just talk to me. Talk to me, Joshua. Or not. Okay, you know, this was wrong. This was a big mistake, I know that, coming here, uninvited. I mean, I pushed myself and this is what I get for it, you know? Hey, you know what? They say that a little humiliation can be a positive experience.",
        "Josh: Reva. Reva...",
        "Reva: It's all right. I'm fine. I am. But I'm just a little worried about you. I am. If you want to talk about anything, I'm a phone call away.",
        "Josh: Okay. What about the...",
        "Reva: (Laughs) We'll save it.",
        "Josh: Okay.",
        "Reva: For the next time.",
        "Josh: Next, on Guiding Light",
        "Jeffrey: There was nothing wrong with that Marah, you know? There's nothing wrong with something that's real, honest, something that comes from the heart.",
        "Marah: But wait a minute, I thought that what we had had nothing to do with our hearts.",
        "Eden: Here. I have a little parting gift for you."
