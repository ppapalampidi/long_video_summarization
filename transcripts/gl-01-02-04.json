        "Ed sees Marah, Michelle and Marina talking at the hospital -- and already frazzled, believes they are conspiring to ask him more questions about Maryanne Caruthers. When he attempts to put them off, he realizes their questions were just about Shayne. Later, he nearly gives Shayne the wrong medicine, and for Ed, it's the last straw. He goes to Company and tells Buzz, Billy and Josh he can't keep the secret any longer. Billy brings Alan into it but no one can talk sense into Ed, who tries to leave. It promises to get violent, quickly, when Ed charges out the door and Billy roughly pulls him back, insisting what they know stays in the room. But they're unaware that Michelle has \"had it\" as well, having witnessed Ed's medical blunder and knowing it's somehow tied to the stress he's feeling -- stress she now fears she put him under by bringing up Maryanne to begin with. She returns to the museum and angrily summons Carrie, demanding the whole story. Carrie is happy to oblige. Harley visits Phillip, and against her better judgment, questions him about things at Spaulding. Getting nothing, she assures him all his friends want him better, soon -- and leaves. She reports in to Jeffrey, who is aware of her visit and asks if she got anything. When Harley rails against the way this job is setting her up against the people she loves, Jeffrey is affected. After Harley goes, he picks up a message Marah had left for him, and he silently and sadly deletes it."

        "Phillip: (Coughing)",
        "Harley: Hi. Hey, Phillip. It's me. It's Harley. How are you doing?",
        "Phillip: Harley.",
        "Harley: I got the all clear from Dr. Langham. So I am completely at your disposal. Get you whatever you need. And this is a limited, one-time offer. So I'd take it, because once you're back out there on the street, uh-uh. So what can I get you? Can I get you some water? Do you want something from the vending machine.",
        "Phillip: No, please.",
        "Harley: Well, I have something for you. Actually I brought you something from... from Zach.",
        "Phillip: Zach?",
        "Harley: Yes. (Laughs lightly) Yes, Zach. Our baby. He made that for you. That's you holding his hand.",
        "Phillip: Oh.",
        "Harley: (Laughs)",
        "Phillip: Oh, we look happy.",
        "Harley: Yes, you do. And there is a reason for that. Zach drew a picture of the day that you get out of the hospital, the day that he gets his father back.",
        "Alan: Gus.",
        "Buzz: I hope that silly overcoat is the only bad habit you picked up from your father.",
        "Alan: Well, you know something, Buzz, we can't all be King of the Burger like you. Or do you prefer the term \"food service\"?",
        "Gus: Hey, hey...",
        "Alan: By the way, why don't you get started on my order?",
        "Buzz: And here I thought my kids had the worst deal in town.",
        "Gus: Hey. Can we just continue the holiday spirit for, like, a few more days or something? Please?",
        "Buzz: I never got the spirit. I've been in a bad mood since October.",
        "Alan: Whoa.",
        "Gus: What's the matter with him?",
        "Alan: I have no idea. I think the grease is starting to go to his brain. But look we... you didn't invite me here to talk about Buzz. What's on your mind? Something about Spaulding?",
        "Gus: Well, sort of.",
        "Alan: Mm-hmm.",
        "Gus: I have a report here that I can use a little help on.",
        "Alan: Oh, right. What? Budget? Finance report?",
        "Gus: No, it's neither one of those. It's a police report.",
        "Alan: What? A police report?",
        "Gus: Yes. A car was pulled out of the river a few days ago. Apparently it's like a \u009170s make and it's been down there ever since.",
        "Alan: Mm. Well, tell me what would a 30-year old relic have to do with me?",
        "Gus: Well, I don't know. That's what I was going to ask you. See actually I ran the license plate and this car belonged to you. So you mind telling me what your car was doing parked at the bottom of the river?",
        "Alan: I can't.",
        "Josh: Marah?",
        "Billy: Hey, man she still in the hospital. Relax.",
        "Josh: Yeah, I got to get back there myself.",
        "Billy: No, you don't, Josh. You got to just slow down, take it easy, and stay away from that place a little bit.",
        "Josh: Well, I just know that with Shayne back in the hospital, Marah's not going to be taking good care of herself. I'm hoping that she comes home and finds food here at least she'll eat something.",
        "Billy: Well, I guess she was concerned... is concerned about her daddy.",
        "Josh: What is that suppose to mean?",
        "Billy: It's not the time.",
        "Josh: Well, you made it the time.",
        "Billy: Okay. You know, how you asked her to stop asking you about Maryanne Caruthers?",
        "Josh: Yeah, she did.",
        "Billy: No, she started asking me about Maryanne Caruthers?",
        "Josh: How could she possibly know that...",
        "Billy: I don't know, Josh. But I'm just saying if you were wrong about her stopping, maybe you were wrong about other things.",
        "Josh: What do you mean?",
        "Billy: What's to say that she and her friends aren't responsible for that car being pulled out of the river?",
        "Michelle: Maryanne Caruthers, Dad. I'm just wondering if you remember her? Maybe remember at least a little something about this woman Maryanne.",
        "Ed: No. I don't.",
        "Michelle: Are you sure?",
        "Michelle: Dad?!",
        "Ed: Will you stop? I told you to drop it! What are you bringing me enforcement now?",
        "Michelle: Dad, we just came to see how Shayne was doing, that's all.",
        "Ed: I'm sorry, girls. I've been up all night with Shayne.",
        "Michelle: But it seemed like you were accusing me of something.",
        "Ed: I'm not accusing you of anything. I actually just thought that you were still upset because I requested we do different work shifts.",
        "Michelle: Okay.",
        "Ed: I'm just... I'm not myself. I'm sorry. I'm tired.",
        "Marina: How is he?",
        "Ed: He's stable. The post operative stage is critical.",
        "Marina: Can I see him?",
        "Ed: No. I just think, you know, he's resting now. And what you should do is when he's resting you should try to get some rest or maybe even go home and bring whatever it is you need to camp out here. So if you'll excuse me.",
        "Michelle: Dad? Dad, we aren't finished.",
        "Ed: Yes, we are!",
        "Billy: This thing has been quiet for 30 years. And now you're telling me that's just a coincidence that these girls start asking questions and the next thing you know they pull that car up out of the river?",
        "Josh: It has to be a coincidence. The only other way they could know would be if somebody told them.",
        "Billy: Oh, and that's not a possibility?",
        "Josh: Are you suggesting that I told them?",
        "Billy: No. Not you. But, Josh, there's a lot of regret here. And where there's regret somebody may want to ease their conscious. I just don't want to see us all get hurt, because one person can't handle the pressure.",
        "Josh: The girls don't know. And they're not going to know.",
        "Billy: How could you be sure?",
        "Josh: Because if my daughter knew, she wouldn't be able to look me straight in the eye. That's how I know.",
        "Billy: Okay. Let's get out of here. This place gives me the creeps.",
        "Carrie: As well it should. As well it should.",
        "Gus: Can't tell me or you won't tell me?",
        "Alan: I can't.",
        "Gus: Can't. So you don't remember what happened to your car?",
        "Alan: No, I don't know what happened to my car. I mean it was stolen. The thief didn't call me up and tell me what he had done with it. Was there a body in the driver seat when you found it?",
        "Gus: No. There was no body. You didn't fill out a report?",
        "Alan: No, I didn't. I mean... why don't... You've been checking on this. Why don't you tell me what went on?",
        "Gus: Now, look, I... I... I understand, you know, you're made of money. I get that. But you get upset when someone takes your pen. So are you telling me you just let this slide?",
        "Alan: No, no. If I lose a pen, I tell my secretary. If I lose a car, I'm sure that I told someone.",
        "Gus: So you didn't cal the police station? That's what people do.",
        "Alan: No, I haven't dealt with them until you came along.",
        "Gus: So you must have called somebody. Who'd you call?",
        "Alan: Look, I'm sure I had my lackey call someone. But it was 30 years ago, Gus.",
        "Gus: Are you telling me that you didn't follow up?",
        "Alan: No.",
        "Gus: On your car?",
        "Alan: Look, I had dozens of cars then, Son. I mean I've had hundreds since then.",
        "Gus: I'm sorry. I can't relate to that, you know, because I personally am working on my fourth car.",
        "Alan: Well, that could be remedied. You are a vice president of Spaulding Enterprises now. I'll be happy to get you a company car.",
        "Gus: No, I don't want a car. I don't want a car. I just want to... I'd like to follow up what happened to this car. So could you please tell me how your car ended up parked at the bottom of the river?",
        "Alan: I don't know how. And my guess is we never will. Now my question to you, Gus, is why are you spending so much time on this when you're on the Spaulding clock, huh?",
        "Gus: That's temporary, okay. And let's never forget that I am a cop first. So... Big Al, all I'm saying is unless the CSI crime team comes up with a miracle, I was really hoping you'd help me just take care of this case. Just put it in the past.",
        "Alan: Well, I'm sorry that I have been more help to you. And I have got to go to a meeting. Excuse me.",
        "Gus: Hey, don't you want to hang out and, like, bust on Buzz for awhile or something?",
        "Alan: Well, I'd like to, but I'm needed somewhere else.",
        "Jeffrey: Satisfied with the answer you got?",
        "Harley: I will just put this up for you. You know, Phillip, you don't have to worry. Zach doesn't even really understand what's going on here. He just wants you to get better. We all do. You're the only one who doesn't think that's a possibility.",
        "Phillip: (Mumbles)",
        "Harley: I just want to help that's all.",
        "Phillip: You are.",
        "Harley: How?",
        "Phillip: Taking care of Zach.",
        "Harley: Well, I'm his mother. I already have that job. I was thinking of helping in a different way. I know sometimes it's really hard for you to shut off your brain. And I was thinking maybe I could help in that way.",
        "Phillip: What?",
        "Harley: Work? Spaulding Enterprises?",
        "Phillip: Too tired. Yeah, too tired.",
        "Harley: It's okay. It's okay. Just take it easy.",
        "Phillip: Yeah...",
        "Harley: And you think about it. Maybe something will come to you. Gus is covering for you like you asked him to. And I was thinking if something's bothering you, you know, if you feel like something is slipping through the cracks, maybe you could tell me and I could tell him, and he would take care of it.",
        "Phillip: I know what you're doing.",
        "Harley: What?",
        "Phillip: It's Langham. He wants you to test my memory.",
        "Harley: No.",
        "Phillip: Yeah.",
        "Harley: No. I came here on my own, Phillip. I really do just want to help. Um... so Gus, he gave me the names of some of the key players there. I'd figured I'd run them by you. You could tell me what you think and then... Gus would have a better idea of what he's dealing with. So I'll just say the names and then you tell me what you think. I'll just say the names. Harrison in Marketing. Lancaster in Bonds. Saunders in Law. Green in Pharmaceuticals. Now, there's a guy, you know, he's got a huge ego, that guy. What do you think about him, Phillip?",
        "Phillip: I can't. I can't because I'm tired.",
        "Harley: You can't?",
        "Phillip: I'm tired.",
        "Harley: You can't because...",
        "Phillip: I'm tired.",
        "Harley: You know that there's something up with Green, or you can't because there's nothing to know?",
        "Phillip: Tired. I'm too tired. I'm too tired.",
        "Harley: You know what, that's okay. You go to sleep. You just go to sleep, okay. I just want you to be safe. I'm just having trouble figuring out how to make you safe, and what I'm saving you from. You sleep. I will tell Zach that his daddy loves him, and that he can't wait to see him. And I can't wait for this whole thing to be over.",
        "Jeffrey: I was wondering how you would react when I called you about this.",
        "Gus: Well, that's not really true, is it? You don't drop a 30-year-old license plate in my lap that belongs to my father and think I'm not going to follow up. No, the only thing that's out of character here for you is the lurking, this lurking that you're doing.",
        "Jeffrey: If I were lurking, you never would have caught me. So I gather from your questions that you're a little uneasy with your father's explanations.",
        "Gus: It took me by surprise.",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, so, the trail is cold.",
        "Gus: Maybe, maybe not.",
        "Jeffrey: Ah, do I hear just a little bit of interest here? Possibility that you might want to pursue this a little further, see where it leads?",
        "Gus: Maybe. Maybe not.",
        "Jeffrey: How nice to see half of Springfield's love couple, or should I say lucky couple?",
        "Brad: I can see that you're all choked up that the charges against my wife have been dropped.",
        "Jeffrey: It's impressive, you know, how both you and your wife avoided prosecution. You must have friends in high places.",
        "Brad: And enemies in low ones. You must hate to lose.",
        "Jeffrey: I never lose. There's all kinds of justice, you know.",
        "Brad: Is that a threat?",
        "Jeffrey: I don't need to threaten you. Just the thought of you and your lovely wife locked up together under one roof forever. Well, if that doesn't scream justice, I don't know what does.",
        "Marah: Jeffrey, hi, it's... it's me. I don't know. I guess I just wanted to hear your voice. And I know what we promised and I'm sticking to that. I don't know. Happy New Year. I'll... I'll see you around. Bye.",
        "Marina: Okay, so I got some PJs, some other stuff I thought Shayne might want when he wakes up. What is all of this? Who raided the grocery store?",
        "Marah: Uh, probably my dad. It had to be him.",
        "Marina: How do you know that?",
        "Marah: Because it's... it's just so him. He's trying to take care of me.",
        "Marina: I thought I knew my grandfather. I don't know, we had this whole rhythm, you know. I knew exactly what he was going to say at just about anything. And now it's... I mean I just can't believe the way that Dr. Bauer yelled at Michelle today. You know, I've never known him to be like that. And... I don't know, how well do we know anybody?",
        "Marah: Well, I'll tell you one thing. I wish I never heard the name Maryanne Caruthers. And we're not the only ones.",
        "Michelle: Okay, I'll get right on these. Is there anymore in this wing?",
        "Nurse: Just Shayne Lewis. But your father's handling that case personally.",
        "Michelle: Okay. Oh, no. Dad, Dad, stop!",
        "Ed: What?",
        "Michelle: Dad. Shayne gets a glucose solution, not this. This is for the patient in 112.",
        "Ed: I picked up the wrong vial. I almost...",
        "Michelle: But you didn't.",
        "Ed: But I could have.",
        "Michelle: Dad, look, even if you had, worst case Shayne would have gotten a longer-than-prescribed nap. You caught it, Dad. But the important thing is to figure out how this happened.",
        "Ed: I just... I shouldn't have taken the double shift.",
        "Michelle: So you're just overtired, that's all? Dad, are you...",
        "Ed: My every mistake doesn't come out of a bottle, Michelle.",
        "Michelle: You understand why I had to ask you, though?",
        "Ed: I'm tired! Does it ever occur to you that my pressure might come from something other than a... than alcohol?",
        "Michelle: Something other? By that you mean me, right?",
        "Ed: I've got to get out of here. Just make sure he gets his glucose.",
        "Michelle: Dad. Look, Lewis needs to get the glucose and I need someone to cover for me as soon as possible.",
        "Nurse: Is something wrong?",
        "Michelle: Yeah, something is really wrong and it ends today.",
        "Jeffrey: It took you long enough.",
        "Harley: Well, I have a life. And what are we doing meeting here instead of the safe house?",
        "Jeffrey: Being swept.",
        "Harley: You mean somebody might have heard some of our conversations?",
        "Jeffrey: Take it easy. It's routine.",
        "Harley: Okay, so it's a safe house. Is it safe? What makes you think that this place could...",
        "Jeffrey: We're safe.",
        "Harley: (Sighs) You and your toys.",
        "Jeffrey: So what do you got for me? Talk to me.",
        "Harley: I have to say I'm a little hurt. There's no food here.",
        "Jeffrey: You want room service? So, listen I ran into Green today. I dropped the hint that it was taking some big guns to get him set free.",
        "Harley: Well, let's just hope that power is not an aphrodisiac.",
        "Jeffrey: Or that it is.",
        "Harley: Look, could we keep the indecent proposal talk to a minimum?",
        "Jeffrey: How was your little meeting with Phillip?",
        "Harley: What?",
        "Jeffrey: You can take your wire off, Harley, okay. But I still got your back 24/7. Okay, I'm watching. So, did he give you anything on Spaulding Enterprises?",
        "Harley: Phillip and I share a child. I went there out of concern. It had nothing to do with this case. And for you to suggest otherwise shows that you don't know me very well.",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, I know you, Terrier. So out with it.",
        "Harley: Even if I did ask Phillip a few innocent questions, it was for Phillip and Gus. Not for you, got it? My motives are pure.",
        "Jeffrey: So are mine, Harley, so are mine.",
        "Marah: Hey, we were just about to stop by the hospital. What is it? Is it Shayne?",
        "Michelle: No, but it could have been.",
        "Marina: Hey, what does that mean?",
        "Michelle: Now, look, Shayne is fine. But my dad has gone over the edge. And I need to find Carrie. Carrie! Carrie, get out here now! This thing is over. Do you hear me? It is over!",
        "Marah: Michelle, are you going to tell us what happened?",
        "Michelle: Look, my dad is a wreck and she is responsible.",
        "Marina: What did she do to him?",
        "Michelle: She didn't have to do anything to him. I did it for her. You guys saw my dad this morning and he's getting more and more out of control by the minute. And it all goes back to the day that I asked him about Maryanne Caruthers. Well, I'm tired of asking. I'm tired of breaking my father's spirit. I want to know what the big, bad secret is, and I want to know now! Carrie!",
        "Buzz: Ed.",
        "Billy: Hey, cat dragged in... Ed, you look terrible.",
        "Josh: How's Shayne doing?",
        "Ed: He's stable. He's stable.",
        "Buzz: You guys come back again, okay.",
        "Woman: Thank you, we will.",
        "Buzz: Ed, what happened?",
        "Ed: All right, look, I need this to be over. We have... we have to stop this now.",
        "Billy: Hey, you don't mean that. It's just the fatigue talking. You up all night with Shayne.",
        "Ed: Billy, I know what I mean.",
        "Billy: Okay, okay, okay. Well, maybe you should just... you should just take us through it so we can... we can help you over with this.",
        "Ed: I almost gave a patient the wrong medication today.",
        "Josh: Well, but you didn't right? I mean, you caught yourself...",
        "Ed: I didn't catch anything; Michelle did.",
        "Josh: My point is nobody got hurt. I mean these things do happen, right?",
        "Ed: The patient was your son. It was just... a sedative this time. But... there were other more powerful drugs on the cart. And if I had given him... one of those...",
        "Josh: But... but you didn't.",
        "Ed: But I could have! I mean, what are we saying here? That someone else has to get hurt before we stop this? We have to come clean.",
        "Billy: Maybe it's just a matter of you cleaning up, Ed.",
        "Ed: Billy, I am not drinking, but I can't keep this in anymore, I can't...",
        "Billy: You can and you will.",
        "Buzz: Ed, Ed, I can't tell you what to do. I mean I've made mistakes, we've all...",
        "Ed: Josh, I don't understand how you can be so calm about what could have happened...",
        "Josh: Ed, all I know is that Shayne wouldn't have come as far as he's come if it hadn't been for you. Now, you almost made a mistake. You didn't make a mistake. You won't make another one, I'm sure.",
        "Ed: This is the beginning of the end. We have all been kidding ourselves. We are going to have to pay for what we did.",
        "Billy: Look, you've always made it a point to stay out of these things, but you need to be here now. And you need to be here right now at Company.",
        "Harley: Even if aliens had dropped down into the middle of the Spaulding boardroom, Phillip wouldn't have noticed a thing.",
        "Jeffrey: Why, he can't recall anything?",
        "Harley: Because whatever's going on at Spaulding's not even on his radar. You know. He's been focused on his family. The man has had a breakdown.",
        "Jeffrey: What about before his family started having these problems?",
        "Harley: I just don't think he knew anything was wrong, really. I don't think that Brad Green has been anything to him more than just a nuisance.",
        "Jeffrey: So you came up empty?",
        "Harley: Well, I didn't say that. Because it got me thinking. Even though Brad Green is just a nuisance to Phillip, he's obviously more important than that to somebody else.",
        "Jeffrey: Really? Who would that be?",
        "Harley: Alexandra.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, I was wondering if you were ever able to get there? You and Alexandra don't exactly get along, do you?",
        "Harley: It's more complicated than that. She is more complicated than that.",
        "Jeffrey: Uh-huh.",
        "Harley: I mean, we got along... well, we didn't get along and then we got along. We don't get along anymore.",
        "Jeffrey: You don't get along, good. Because when she sees you cozying up with Brad Green, she might do something. She might react, slip up.",
        "Harley: Is that what this is about? You think that Alexandra is out to hurt Phillip and Gus?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, it wouldn't be the first time, would it? Harley, this thing might take us to Alexandra. It might take us to the mailroom, I don't know. Okay, I don't have a personal agenda here. I can't say the same thing for you.",
        "Harley: I do not want to be the one to have to tell Phillip that Alexandra is up to her old tricks.",
        "Jeffrey: Aren't Buzz and Alexandra...",
        "Harley: Oh, boy, this just gets better and better.",
        "Jeffrey: Can you handle it?",
        "Harley: Well, of course I can handle it. I just don't want to have to handle it. Small town, got to love it, right? Everybody's into everybody else's business. But you wouldn't know a thing about that, right, Jeffrey?",
        "Jeffrey: No, I guess I wouldn't.",
        "Gus: All right, your turn. Your turn.",
        "Phillip: Why...",
        "Gus: Why? Why are we playing checkers, is that... Because I'm too smart to play chess and get a whooping, so it's your turn. Go ahead. Okay, there you go. And now it's my turn. King me, look at that. I got to tell you that's seven games in a row. You owe me another million dollars. Plus the four million, that's five million. You can pay me Tuesday. Because I know you're good for it. (Laughs) So, the doctor says you've been like, you know, dozing in and out all day. How you feeling?",
        "Phillip: Everybody asks.",
        "Gus: Everybody? Somebody come by to visit you?",
        "Phillip: Harley.",
        "Gus: Really?",
        "Phillip: Hmm.",
        "Gus: I didn't know that she was coming by.",
        "Phillip: She did.",
        "Gus: How about Big Al, did he come?",
        "Phillip: No, not today.",
        "Gus: Hmm. How's he been? His normal self? Obsessive, controlling, compulsive self. No? That's how he shows his love to you, right? Yeah. You two have really been through it, haven't you? Yeah. ( Laughs) I mean, wow. I got to... I mean I'm getting the kinder, gentler Alan. And I got to tell you, I owe you for that big time, for breaking him in. I appreciate it, I really do. But you see, what you get is you get to know him better than me, really. Well, you have no reason to think he's not being truthful when he says he wants to see you get better. You know. I mean, because if he didn't mean it, you would know. You'd feel it. But for me, I don't know. I just... I'm still trying to get to know him, you know. Like, for example, I don't think that he's ever lied to me... that I know of. I don't... I mean, I'm sure he's lied to you like a thousand... a thousand times probably. But to me, not so much. I don't... I mean, do you think that he has anything... anything to lie to me about?",
        "Phillip: (Laughs)",
        "Buzz: Ed.",
        "(Knock at the door)",
        "(Indistinct conversation)",
        "Alan: Well, I want you all to know that I've handled everything. I told Gus that the car was stolen. So, you can break up this little meeting of yours.",
        "Ed: How do you do it, Alan?",
        "Alan: How do I do what?",
        "Ed: Not care about anything.",
        "Alan: You know, Ed, I think you could learn something from me.",
        "Buzz: Oh, please, Alan, enlighten us.",
        "Alan: You all think you're so much better than I am because you go to her grave once a year and put a rose on it. Well, you do that out of guilt, because it's not going to bring her back. And coming forward is certainly not going to bring her back. It's in the past, that's where it should stay. And I resent being drug back into this thing.",
        "Ed: You resent it? You pompous son of a...",
        "Alan: Maybe, maybe I have gone on with my life, Ed. And I think you need to put it in the past.",
        "Ed: Past? Does this look like the past to you? This is what we have to face up to!",
        "Billy: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Wait, wait. You don't have the right to make that choice. This is about all of us now, every one of us. You can't throw your life away without throwing the rest of our lives away.",
        "Ed: Do you honestly not know what's going on here, Billy?",
        "Billy: Okay, Ed, you tell me what's going on.",
        "Ed: This thing for all these years has been underneath the surface just like that car. But, now, it's being dragged up again. It's not in the past anymore! It's on top of us! Of all of us!",
        "Billy: Okay, Ed, I agree. But each one of us has to find a way to deal with it. And, Ed, this ain't dealing with it.",
        "Ed: Well, how is it then? I mean, lying to his children, that may be fine for Alan, but it's not for the rest of us.",
        "Josh: No, it's not.",
        "Ed: Billy, do you know how close I am to drinking? Man, I can taste it. Do you know how close I came to seriously hurting a patient today? Hiding this thing is not doing any of us any good. It is not saving us. It's doing exactly the opposite. And anyone who doesn't admit this is lying to himself! We have to do now what we should have done then. And that's the only way to stop this!",
        "Billy: We'll stop it, yeah. Well, if it would stop it, that'd be great, but it won't stop it! It's just the beginning. Ed, you think it's bad now, this is nothing! Just think, just -- all of you -- think about the look on your daughters' face when they find out the truth. That's what I've been thinking about. I mean, this isn't about us anymore; it's about our kids and our grandkids. And it's about what it's going to do to them. Now, I don't think they should have to suffer for what we done. My kids have suffered plenty at my hands. I don't intend to add to it. And, Ed, I do not intend to let you add to it.",
        "Alan: Ed... Ed, you've got to pull yourself together. Now, you have got to figure out some way to deal with this.",
        "Ed: It's too late for that, Alan. It's too late.",
        "Jeffrey: All right, so you report before you meet up with Green for your big date.",
        "Harley: Please don't call it a date.",
        "Jeffrey: Sorry, rendezvous, how about...",
        "Harley: Assignment.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, assignment. Harley, your family and friends are all over this case, you know that.",
        "Harley: Well, isn't that why you hired me, so you could get six degrees of Harley?",
        "Jeffrey: I don't care how you do it, but you're going to have to manage your feelings, okay. I don't want them interfering with this job.",
        "Harley: You know it's a funny thing, Jeffrey. I used to think that feelings were a strength.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, they can be if you can control them.",
        "Harley: Awfully big sacrifice for a job.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, consider yourself one of the lucky ones, Harley. You're only in this temporarily. Some people are lifers.",
        "Harley: And at what cost?",
        "Jeffrey: Whatever it takes.",
        "Harley: What if it takes everything? Right. Okay. Oh, by the way, you got a message there, Jeff.",
        "Marah's Voice: Jeffrey, hi, it's... it's me. I just... I don't know... I just wanted to hear your voice. And I know what we promised and I'm... I'm sticking to that. So, happy New Year and I'll see you around. Bye.",
        "Alan: From the looks of things, Ed, you've paid a heavy price over this. You have for a long time.",
        "Billy: You know, Ed, if you crack this thing open, it's not going to be pretty. And it's not going to give you any relief.",
        "Ed: Good. No relief, that's what we all deserve.",
        "Billy: Yeah, but what about my kids? What do they deserve?",
        "Ed: No more lies! The truth!",
        "Alan: Ed, Ed, Ed, wait a minute. We're not through talking this out.",
        "Ed: You're not going to talk me out of anything ever again, Alan. You're not going to talk me out of anything. I'm going to say what I know.",
        "Alan: Ed, Ed, Ed...",
        "Billy: Hey! Wait.. (Mumbles) Can't let you leave. The truth has to stay here. It has to.",
        "Michelle: Where is she?",
        "Marah: You know, Michelle, maybe it's best if you don't find her right now.",
        "Marina: Yeah, maybe we should just talk about this, and you should fill us in.",
        "Michelle: Okay, look, I realized today that we're not helping. I'm not helping my father. You're not helping Josh. You're not helping Buzz. In fact, we are destroying them. And it's all thanks to Carrie. And I just want to know why, and I want to know now! Where the hell is she? Carrie!",
        "Carrie: Temper, temper, temper, temper. My dear, you'll raise the dead.",
        "Michelle: I want the truth, Carrie, all of it, now.",
        "Carrie: Well, of course, my dear. Why don't you pull up a chair?",
        "Gus: Next on Guiding Light :",
        "Jeffrey: If I didn't tell you this before, but that plate was taken from a car that was found at the bottom of a river.",
        "Reva: Who was it?",
        "Michelle: We need to know who Maryanne Caruthers was. And we need to know what exactly happened the night that she died. And we need to know now!"
