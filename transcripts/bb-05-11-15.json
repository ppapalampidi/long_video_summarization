    "Recap": [
        "Wyatt tells Liam that he took a gamble and told Nicole and he knew she was hiding something huge. Liam will not believe this. Liam thinks she must be an alien from another planet, tell him already! Rick welcomes Nick and says any friend of Maya's is a friend of his. She has changed his life and he has learned to trust her, so Nick is welcome to the Forrester house on the hill. Brooke tells Ridge this is a very delicate matter but she has been very straight forward to Maya that she has to tell Rick she is transgender or she will. She tells Ridge that Rick has to have a year or Ridge would spend all that time trying to bring him down. Rick tells Maya he has to go attend to something. It is either now or be interrupted on their trip and he does not want that. Nick tells Maya that if Rick proposes tonight and she tells him everything, still he might freak out at first. Nick says violence against trans women are very high. Maya says Rick is not like that and she believes he will accept it well as long as he hears it from her and no one else. Carter asks Nicole why the long face. She said she did something that felt good at the time but now she is not so sure. She is pretty sure Rick is going to propose tonight. And Wyatt could be her Rick and she is keeping a huge secret and she told him about Maya's past.",
        "Liam is stunned when Wyatt tells him that Maya did not steal someone's identity but she did change her name from Myron to Maya. She is transgender. Liam thinks he is joking. Wyatt says he feels badly about getting this out of Nicole but she needed to tell someone and he was there. Liam wonders if he feels badly enough now not to want to use this information against Rick. Ridge tells Brooke that Rick is not just going to see past this with Maya. If he could not accept Caroline kissing Ridge, this will really push him over the edge. Poor Ricky will finally get his comeuppance. Maya has flashbacks of her telling Carter and Nicole that she will tell Rick when the time is right .and them telling her do not tell Rick, there is no need for him to know. Rick meets up with Maya later and tells her it is time to go, destiny awaits. Brooke tells Ridge that Rick and Caroline would still be together if it had not been for Ridge. And the more Rick falls, the more Ridge will like it. This is personal. Ridge says no, if that were the case he would have gone directly to Rick with this information, Brooke says Maya has to be the one to give Rick the truth. Carter is livid. Nicole says she did not go over to Wyatt's ready to tell him, it just came out. Wyatt ways no, he is not letting Rick off the hook. They must use this information now to take down Rick for good. Liam agrees that Maya is just as insufferable as Rick but how is this going to hurt Rick. Nicole tells Carter that she told Wyatt not to tell anyone, she trusts him. Carter is not so sure .some little sister. Carter says he always felt Maya should have told Rick long ago. Wyatt tells Liam that he has been building the entire FC around Maya and when this comes out .think about everything he has done and this is their chance to take him down or at least off kilter so they can swoop in. They cannot back down now. Brooke tells Ridge now it is up to Maya to tell Rick the truth and whatever happens after that is up to Rick. Rick and Maya arrive at the cabin. She says it is so beautiful and peaceful, like another world. He says that is what happens when you get out of that rat race. He is through defending her, he only wants to be with her. She says no matter what happens she believes they can overcome anything no matter what. Wyatt tells Liam that Maya's secret could take down Rick ..and ruin her life."

        "Wyatt: We have what we need now -- a bombshell so huge --",
        "Liam: Oh, my God. Tell me already!",
        "Wyatt: I took a gamble. I confessed to her that I'd overheard her and her sister talking the other day.",
        "Liam: Wait a second, wait a second. You admitted that?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. I knew she was hiding something huge. I said that I thought it was Rick at first, and then -- oh, man! You -- you are not gonna believe this.",
        "Liam: Come on, Wyatt! Tell me already! What is it?! Spill it! What, is she an alien from another galaxy or something? What did Maya do that Rick is gonna pay for?",
        "Rick: So, exactly how do you two know each other again?",
        "Maya: I told you -- nick is my friend from when I first moved to L.A.",
        "Nick: We have a lot in common. More than people would think.",
        "Rick: Well, that's great. Any friend of Maya's is a friend of mine. You're welcome here. You're welcome at the house. The Forrester estate on the hill. I've heard of it.",
        "Maya: I still can't believe I'm living there with this wonderful man.",
        "Rick: Did Maya tell you how we met? It's quite the love story. And it's only just beginning. Maya's changed my life. I've learned to trust again, thanks to her.",
        "Ridge: I'm a little confused here. You were all riled up, saying, \"no one's gonna do this to my son,\" and then let him walk out of here into an epic disaster without any help.",
        "Brooke: This is a delicate matter, Ridge. I was very firm was Maya. She has to tell my son about her past before he proposes to her.",
        "Ridge: Mm. This is gonna hit Rick like nothing ever has before.",
        "Brooke: Oh, please. You've done nothing the last few months except try to undermine my son's position as C.E.O. So all of a sudden, you want me to believe that you care about his feelings?",
        "Ridge: Nope. No, you're right. I should just let him get what's coming to him. And I probably would... if he weren't so important to you.",
        "Brooke: No matter what you think Rick's done to you --",
        "Ridge: What I think he's done to me? I was supposed to be CEO after my father.",
        "Brooke: Nothing was ever written in stone. And, yes, Stephanie always told you that being CEO was your birthright.",
        "Ridge: Why are you bringing up my mother? It's nothing to do with her. This has to do with your son manipulating my father into giving him irrevocable control of this company for a year.",
        "Brooke: Rick had to have absolute control. Otherwise, you'd spend every waking hour trying to bring him down.",
        "Ridge: Ah, yes. There's the irony. It's not the man he trusted least that's gonna be his downfall. It's the woman he trusted most.",
        "Rick: Yeah, I'll get right on that. Thank you. [Grumbles]",
        "Maya: Is there a problem?",
        "Rick: Well, either I handle it now, or we'll be interrupted tonight. And nothing is gonna interrupt the special plans that I have for us. Nick, nice to meet you.",
        "Nick: You too. Nice guy. I see why you fell so hard for him.",
        "Maya: Honestly... I don't know what I would do if I lost Rick.",
        "Nick: There's no reason why you should, especially if he's as loving and understanding as you say. Still... if Rick does propose tonight, and you do tell him everything, even the most enlightened person... do you remember Roberta from the support group, what happened when she told her boyfriend? She was alone, and he freaked out, and he beat her so severely, she --",
        "Maya: I know, I know. But I told you, Rick's not like that.",
        "Nick: Good. Because violence against trans women, often at the hands of the guys they're seeing --",
        "Maya: And thank God we're not dealing with that with Rick. I will make him understand. I know he will. As long as he hears about my past from me and nobody else.",
        "Nicole: Hey.",
        "Carter: If you're looking for Wyatt, I haven't seen him.",
        "Nicole: No.",
        "Carter: One ride in the Spencer jet and you're already over the guy?",
        "Nicole: I'm not \"over\" Wyatt.",
        "Carter: So why the long face?",
        "Nicole: I did something... and it...felt right at the time, but... now I'm wondering.",
        "Wyatt: Your guess about Maya being an alien -- well, when Rick finds out who she really is, that Maya will be an alien to him, because she's not who he thinks she is.",
        "Liam: What are you saying right now? Did Maya steal somebody's identity?",
        "Wyatt: No. She just changed her own in a major way. Maya was originally Myron. She's transgender.",
        "Ridge: I don't want you to get the wrong impression. I'm... I'm not going after Maya because of a decision that she's made for herself. She's transitioned from one gender to another. I can't even begin to imagine what that is. But for her to think and for you to think that Rick is just gonna see past this... when a couple of kisses with Caroline almost sent him off the deep end.",
        "Brooke: That is totally different. The person that kisses his wife is the same man that --",
        "Ridge: He hates. He hates me. He's always hated me because of what I've done to you all your life.",
        "Brooke: He sees Maya differently.",
        "Ridge: Oh, come on. He sees what he wants to see -- what he wants us to see. Poor Ricky. Finally gonna get his comeuppance.",
        "Carter: When do you plan on telling him?",
        "Maya: When I'm ready.",
        "Carter: No.",
        "Maya: We are devoted to each other. He will love me no matter what.",
        "Carter: Then tell him. Oh, yeah, wait. You're waiting for a proposal. Get the ring, hook him, then be honest.",
        "Maya: The Rick I know will accept me for the woman that I am.",
        "Carter: Then call him in here.",
        "Maya: I will not be bullied by you. I will tell Rick on my terms -- when he proposes.",
        "Nicole: You can't tell Rick you're transgender unless you're ready to lose it all. Don't be foolish. We'll keep it quiet, and he'll never have to know. [Echoing] Don't tell him.",
        "Brooke: Wouldn't it be better to have a proposal from a man who knew you and accepted you and loved you... for all that you are? Please, just tell him before he asks you to be his wife.",
        "Maya: Hi.",
        "Rick: Hey.",
        "Maya: Problem solved?",
        "Rick: Problem solved. It's time to hit the road.",
        "Maya: Are you sure?",
        "Rick: What?",
        "Maya: Us in the cabin? What if another one of your family members is up there?",
        "Rick: Like I would leave that to chance. This is our night, a night like none we've ever shared. So let's get going, beautiful. Destiny awaits.",
        "Nicole: Look, I know what you think of me, that I only like Wyatt because he's a Spencer, but there's more to it.",
        "Carter: If you say so.",
        "Nicole: Wyatt's fun to be with, easy to talk to, doesn't judge... and I think it could really work out for us. If we get the chance.",
        "Carter: Why wouldn't you get the chance?",
        "Nicole: Maya's pretty sure that Rick's gonna propose tonight. And if he does, she feels she has to tell him everything, which means that --",
        "Carter: Things could change in a big way for the Avant sisters. Look, I'm no gold digger, okay? Neither is Maya. But Wyatt could be my Rick, you know? Only he's all about no secrets, and I'm carrying a freaking huge one, even if it's not about me.",
        "Carter: Please say this isn't going where I think it is.",
        "Nicole: I was just at Wyatt's, and he could see that something was weighing on me.",
        "Carter: You told him? You told Wyatt about Maya's past?",
        "Liam: [Chuckles] All right. That's a good one. That's funny.",
        "Wyatt: I'm serious, bro. This is what Maya has been keeping from Rick all this time. Nicole told you this?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. Maya swore her to secrecy, but I guess -- I guess it finally became too much for her. She had to tell somebody, and I was there. Oh, my God! I just -- oh! I -- I feel really bad about Nicole.",
        "Liam: I mean, enough not to use the information against Rick after all?",
        "Brooke: Be honest, Ridge. The harder Rick falls, the better.",
        "Ridge: Well, if that were true, I'd have gone to Rick the moment that Carter told me about Maya. If anyone has the right to rub his face in it, it's me.",
        "Brooke: No. Certainly could not be you. You broke up his marriage, and you pushed him into Maya's arms.",
        "Ridge: That's not how it happened.",
        "Brooke: Rick and Caroline would still be married if you didn't make a play for Caroline.",
        "Ridge: I didn't make a play for Caroline any more than you made a play for Katie's husband all those months ago. But, hey, if that's what you need to believe to justify Rick's behavior as a husband and the CEO, you go ahead.",
        "Brooke: The company has been flourishing under Rick's leadership. Forrester is the envy of all fashion houses.",
        "Ridge: You don't think all those other fashion houses would love to see Forrester just drown in a sea of public controversy?",
        "Brooke: This can't go public. This is a personal issue.",
        "Ridge: I agree with you. But if the press gets a whiff of this, what are we gonna do? Too many people know about this already -- you, me, my dad, Nicole, Carter...",
        "[Cell phone beeps]",
        "Ridge: If anything slips out, I... ah. I'm wanted elsewhere.",
        "Brooke: Promise me you're not gonna say anything to Rick. This is for Maya to do. She's the one who has to tell him the truth.",
        "Nicole: Don't freak, okay? It's not like it sounds.",
        "Carter: Did you or did you not tell Wyatt Spencer --",
        "Nicole: Okay, it is like it sounds.",
        "Carter: Do you have any idea what you've done?",
        "Nicole: Will you chill? It's not like I went over to Wyatt's intending to tell him.",
        "Carter: Doesn't matter. The point is, thanks to you, the guy knows, and so will the rest of the Spencer clan if they don't already.",
        "Nicole: Wyatt is not like that. He won't say anything.",
        "Carter: Can you really be that naive? His family owns a publishing empire. Peddling salacious stories is how they've made their billions. And now Wyatt knows, too. This...",
        "Nicole: \"Too\"? You've told someone about Maya's past?",
        "Wyatt: I said I feel bad for Nicole. I'm not an idiot. I'm not letting Rick off the hook.",
        "Liam: Well, good, yeah. I -- you know, 'cause... Ivy and Caroline -- everyone at Forrester has suffered enough. We have to restore some sanity back over there, but...",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Liam: The question is, how? I mean, I agree, Maya is just as insufferable as Rick, but... I don't know, dude. Private business is private business.",
        "Wyatt: Or is it?",
        "Liam: How did you get Nicole to finally open up about this?",
        "Wyatt: I told you. I rolled the dice. I revealed what I overheard, hoping that Nicole would tell me the rest, which she did. And it took a little gentle encouragement, but we need to use what we know now to take down Rick -- for good.",
        "Carter: What I've done or haven't done is not the issue. It's what will Wyatt do now that you've given him ammunition.",
        "Nicole: I told him he can't tell anyone.",
        "Carter: Okay. Come on, man. I can see you're second-guessing yourself.",
        "Nicole: All right, maybe I am but not because I don't trust Wyatt. Because I gave Maya my word that I wouldn't say anything to anyone.",
        "Carter: And now you have.",
        "Nicole: Some little sister, huh?",
        "Carter: Look, Nicole... I've always felt that Maya should've told Rick long ago. She was adamant about waiting, which is risky, and now she's not only facing her past coming out but who learns it first -- Rick... or the entire world.",
        "Wyatt: It's all about Rick's arrogance. He's been building Forrester's entire image around Maya. Now when this comes out...",
        "Liam: I don't know, man. I don't know. It just -- it just... seems really private.",
        "Wyatt: Dude, am I after Maya? No. This is about Rick. This is what we've been talking about -- finally getting him out as CEO of Forrester. Think about everything he's done to Ivy and Caroline. This is our chance to take Rick down, or at least knock him off-kilter so we can swoop in. Look, is this how I wanted it to go? No. But we can't back down now.",
        "Brooke: Where were you?",
        "Ridge: Not running to big bear to check on Maya and Rick, that's for sure.",
        "Brooke: Oh, thank God.",
        "Ridge: So what if she doesn't tell? What's your plan b?",
        "Brooke: She has to. She owes it to my son to tell him the truth before he proposes. Whatever happens after that, whatever Rick decides to do, though, will be up to him.",
        "Rick: Chilly.",
        "Maya: Yeah. Wow! [Laughs] Uh, wow. So, who built the fire?",
        "Rick: I phoned the caretaker. I told him we were on our way up.",
        "Maya: This is beautiful. And it's so peaceful and quiet. It's like our own little world.",
        "Rick: Well, that's the idea. No distractions, no hassles, just the two of us... and a couple dozen bears outside the front door.",
        "Maya: What?",
        "Rick: I'm kidding.",
        "Maya: Look at you. Just got up here and you're all relaxed.",
        "Rick: Well, that's what happens when you get out of that rat race.",
        "Maya: It's more than that. It's the people who judge us and our relationship... who never believed that we would make it. You've had to defend me to everyone.",
        "Rick: I'm done defending. I only want to focus on you... and our future.",
        "Maya: If only we knew what our future holds. But whatever happens, I believe we can overcome anything and that we will never lose sight of how much we love each other... no matter what.",
        "Wyatt: Maya's secret could take down Rick.",
        "Liam: And ruin her life."
