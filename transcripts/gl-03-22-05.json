        "Tammy: Hi.",
        "Sandy: Hi. You... you look...",
        "Tammy: Thank you.",
        "Sandy: Yeah. Wow. No, thank you. I mean... I mean, you're welcome. I'm being weird. Sorry.",
        "Tammy: Cute weird.",
        "Sandy: I just feel...",
        "Tammy: I know. So what you've got back there?",
        "Sandy: Ah... oh, these. Just some flowers.",
        "Tammy: ( Sighs )",
        "Sandy: I kind of found flowers that sum up you... who you are. And this one I thought kind of resembled your heart and soul. What?",
        "Tammy: This is the best start to a day. I sort of wish there was music playing. ( Music blaring)",
        "Sandy: Not exactly what I had planned. Who's that?",
        "Tammy: Next-door neighbor, i guess.",
        "Sandy: Yes, we could still make it to the film. Do you want to go? What?",
        "Tammy: I was kind of actually hoping that we could stay here. Unless you're really into a movie.",
        "Sandy: Sounds good to me.",
        "Tammy: What?",
        "Sandy: I said it sounds good to me. I'm just going to go next door and tell this jerk to turn it down.",
        "Tammy: I'll do it. I'll do it. You know what? They're my neighbors and I'll just go introduce myself and be nice and sweet about it. ( Knocking ) excuse me? Hello? It's your neighbor. Could you turn down?",
        "Jonathan: Howdy, neighbor. Come by for a cup of sugar?",
        "Marina: I can't believe you won't even let me help around here. I'm very handy.",
        "Danny: No. Union rules. Don't look at me like that. I'm serious. I have to be very careful. There are some people out there who would be very happy if i broke one rule so they could just come after me.",
        "Marina: They're just jealous. How about I sweep?",
        "Danny: No, how about if you save your energy?",
        "Marina: Mm. I like the sound of that.",
        "Danny: I know. I'm talking about the trial. I thought you were going to put in a full day at the courthouse. Not that I'm trying to get rid of you.",
        "Marina: I can'T. I can't sit there and listen to harley testify. I know this is the one day i should be there for her.",
        "Danny: I understand. I do. You know, harley has a great support system between your dad and your grandfather.",
        "Marina: Yeah. I think that my dad was actually relieved when I asked to be excused today. He hates it when I see him upset. So I went to the restaurant and did some reordering and stopped by and checked on the kids. And now, here I am.",
        "Danny: You know, I'm glad.",
        "Marina: You know, I really like this place.",
        "Danny: Yeah.",
        "Marina: I think I can live in a place like this someday.",
        "Danny: Mm-hmm. Well, someday you will.",
        "Marina: That would be a first for my family. We never live anywhere normal. We're always either above the restaurant we're running or in a firehouse or staying with friends. Even in california, my mom and I, we lived in this weird basement apartment with, like, one window.",
        "Danny: Please all those places still sound better than the house I grew up in.",
        "Marina: Please.",
        "Danny: No.",
        "Marina: I saw your place. It was big and fancy. What is wrong with that?",
        "Danny: Too quiet for one thing. Too many whispered conversation, too many breakable objects.",
        "Marina: Nobody.",
        "Danny: Not a very comfortable place for a kid.",
        "Marina: Nobody whispers in my family.",
        "Danny: I like that. That's good. Marina, I've had enough whispering to last a lifetime. I like things loud and clear and straightforward.",
        "Marina: Hm.",
        "Danny: Marina cooper style.",
        "Marina: Well, I'm questioning the whole loud and clear thing, lately.",
        "Danny: Why?",
        "Marina: Doesn't seem to be working too well for my family.",
        "Bill: Why? Why would you do this? Why would you take a picture of gus and the witness?",
        "Olivia: I can explain. I can...",
        "Bill: Do you realize you probably just ruined harley's case?",
        "Olivia: Listen, I want to tell you why.",
        "Bill: You may have destroyed any chance she has to go free. Do you realize this?",
        "Olivia: Yeah, all right. I took the picture. I don't regret it. Neither should you.|",
        "Alan: Counsel, I don't want to jinx things, but it's looking more and more like victory.",
        "Jeffrey: I've never lost a son, so I can't pretend to understand the pain that you've gone through... that you're going through. But take a look around. How much misery is enough?",
        "Alan: I'll let you know when we get there.",
        "Gus: I can'T... I can't let you take the stand.",
        "Harley: We're getting crushed. You have nothing left for my defense.",
        "Gus: O'neill's going to tear you apart.",
        "Harley: The only shot we have is for the jury to hear my side.",
        "Gus: We have a witness says he saw phillip alive when you left.",
        "Harley: A witness who lied.",
        "Gus: O'neill cannot prove that.",
        "Harley: The jury heard it already, gus.",
        "Gus: Look, you're angry. You want to be angry at me? Fine. Want to hate me? Fine. But I cannot do this. I can't let you get up on the stand.",
        "Harley: I need to talk to the jury, okay. I need to do this. If I go down, at least I go down fighting. At least I have that.",
        "Judge: Mr. Aitoro, your witness.",
        "Gus: Yes, your honor. The defense would like to call harley cooper to the stand.",
        "Tammy: What are you doing here?",
        "Jonathan: Living. I needed a place to crash, and this dump seemed as good a place as any. So... I know it seems like I planned this, but I swear I had no clue that you lived next door. But, hey, we practically live together. Is that for me?",
        "Tammy: Don't you dare.",
        "Sandy: You have got to be kidding me.",
        "Tammy: I thought you were happy making josh and reva miserable.",
        "Jonathan: They were cramping my style.",
        "Sandy: They threw him out.",
        "Jonathan: That, too.",
        "Sandy: Reva finally he was just dragging her down.",
        "Jonathan: Let me guess. You got that story from josh. Don't you just hate it when he makes his resentment so obvious?",
        "Tammy: Why did you move out?",
        "Jonathan: Well, reva and josh were fighting and they needed to work things out and it was a mutual agreement.",
        "Sandy: And he just happened to find this place in the phone book, right?",
        "Jonathan: What's the matter, love? I'm not going to steal your girl.",
        "Sandy: That's not what worries me. What worries me is all the drama and trouble you bring with you. You know what? If he's not going to move out, we're going to move you out.",
        "Tammy: No, sandy, I'm not leaving.",
        "Olivia: Listen to me. I am not proud of what I've done, but I had no choice.",
        "Bill: We always have choices.",
        "Olivia: All right, then my choice was not crushed by alan. My choice was to protect my daughter. He promised me that if harley wasn't evicted, I was going to hang for phillip's murder.",
        "Bill: So I don't understand. What does he have you doing? Sneaking around finding ways to bury harley? Is that what you do?",
        "Olivia: No. Everything they said about that witness was true.",
        "Bill: We are talking about life in prison for harley. Do you realize this?",
        "Olivia: Would you rather it be me?",
        "Bill: What are you talking about? What does alan even have on you to begin with?",
        "Olivia: He doesn't need to have anything on me? He says he's going to do it, he's going to do it.",
        "Bill: And you believe that?",
        "Olivia: Don't underestimate him. I cannot lose my baby to him because you're friends with harley.",
        "Bill: Okay. This is what gets me. Because you're not taking these pictures sneaking around and finding truth. Olivia, you're not doing this for alan. You're doing this for the same reason you sold the lewis building to alan-- to further your place in the house of spaulding. ( Banging gavel )",
        "Judge: If we could all come to order, please.",
        "Gus: I believe in you.",
        "Harley: I know.",
        "Gus: I don't know what happened that night, but I know you. I know your heart.",
        "Judge: Will the witness please take the stand?",
        "Harley: My father said act like you have faith it will come to you. Trust me.",
        "Bailiff: Do you swear to tell the truth, so help you god?",
        "Harley: I do.",
        "Gus: Ms. Cooper, the night that phillip spaulding was shot you... you went to go and see him. Why is that?",
        "Harley: My ex-husband had kidnapped my children. I went there to get them back.",
        "Gus: But you went in a disguise is that right?",
        "Harley: Yes. Because I knew that phillip wouldn't trust me. But I thought he might trust ruth karloff.",
        "Gus: I see. And did you bring a weapon with you?",
        "Harley: No.",
        "Gus: Nothing to protect yourself.",
        "Harley: I wasn't afraid for myself.Myself.",
        "Gus: Mm-hmm. What happened then when you got to the restaurant?",
        "Harley: Phillip was there. He was drinking a beer. He'd cut his hand breaking into the place through a window. It was bleeding and he had a handkerchief wrapped around it.",
        "Gus: And what did you do when you saw him?",
        "Harley: Not much. It was apparent that he knew i was ruth. I mean he knew she was me.",
        "Gus: How did he react?",
        "Harley: He was furious. He was screaming at me. He was saying that I had betrayed him, that I didn't deserve my children. He had a gun. And he put the gun on the counter between us. He was daring me to pick it up. We argued and then he put the gun in my hand and we struggled and then the next thing i remember clearly is standing outside company and you were telling me that phillip had been shot.",
        "Gus: So you have absolutely no recollection of anything right after that struggle?",
        "Harley: No.",
        "Gus: Miss cooper, when phillip spaulding was killed you made a videotape, a confession as ruth karloff, but you confessed to the murder. Why is that?",
        "Harley: I was trying to protect my father. At that point, he was the prime suspect in the case, and all the signs were suggesting that he was guilty. My father had been ill. He has a heart condition, and i was afraid that he wouldn't survive a trial.",
        "Gus: I really only have one other question. Do you know who shot phillip spaulding?",
        "Harley: No.",
        "Gus: Thank you. No further questions.",
        "Judge: Mr. O'neill?",
        "Jeffrey: Yes, your honor. Miss cooper, you say you don't recall what happened after you argued with phillip spaulding and he put a gun in front of you. Is that correct?",
        "Harley: Yes.",
        "Jeffrey: Are you a forgetful person?",
        "Harley: No.",
        "Jeffrey: Have you ever blacked out before or lost consciousness or anything like that?",
        "Harley: I don't think so.",
        "Jeffrey: So this is the first time something like that has happened?",
        "Harley: Well, when I got back to company my head was bleeding. So I think I must have hit my head.",
        "Jeffrey: You think. Do you remember hitting your head?",
        "Harley: No.",
        "Jeffrey: No. Or perhaps it wasn't a blow to the head at all. It's medical fact that sometimes, you know, people will block out memories when a traumatic event occurs.",
        "Harley: Is that a question?",
        "Jeffrey: Isn't it possible, miss cooper, that that traumatic event was the shooting of phillip spaulding.",
        "Gus: Objection.",
        "Judge: Overruled.",
        "Jeffrey: Isn't it possible that you blacked out because you shot and killed phillip spaulding? Is that possible?",
        "Harley: Yes.",
        "Sandy: Why would you want to stay living next door to him?",
        "Tammy: We are living our lives and we're not running away.",
        "Sandy: So you're going to stay to prove something to him.",
        "Tammy: No, to myself.",
        "Sandy: You have nothing to prove.",
        "Tammy: Yes, I do. I'm not going to let jonathan hurt me anymore. And in some way, he would probably always try. But the minute I give up my life to being afraid of him, it's over. I lose. And not just the future, but the whole thing. He wins everything. And I've been through too much to let that happen. Besides, I've seen something in him.",
        "Sandy: Okay. I don't think I want to hear anymore of this.",
        "Tammy: Listen. He's not as tough as you make him out to be. He's not as tough as he pretends to be. He knows it. And he knows I know it.",
        "Sandy: Then you've proved your point.",
        "Tammy: Not yet.",
        "Sandy: It's just that you're putting yourself in danger. And I don't want him anywhere near you.",
        "Tammy: I get that.",
        "Sandy: No. You know, I don't think you do get it. I don't think you get how much I...",
        "Tammy: How much you what?",
        "Jonathan: Where are you? Hey, reva, um... yeah, that's right. Get drunk. Call mommy. Don't do it. She's the one who's going to come crawling back. Don't you beg. Don't you beg for anything. You remember who you are.",
        "Danny: Just try to keep the faith with harley. I don't think even the da wants to see her go down for killing phillip. I really don'T.",
        "Marina: Still, he has to do his job, right? I mean, look what he did with you.",
        "Danny: Mm. Let's think about something else. Like the townhouse that I'm going to build for you one day.",
        "Marina: Really?",
        "Danny: Mm-hmm.",
        "Marina: And how much cash will that cost me?",
        "Danny: Hmm. A lot.",
        "Marina: Great. I'll get back to you in like ten years, if that soon.",
        "Danny: I don't know. Maybe we could arrange a little payment plan.",
        "Marina: Really?",
        "Danny: Mm-hmm.",
        "Marina: And what would that entail?",
        "Danny: Lunch. Yeah, you could make your first payment by hopping over to company and bringing me back something yummy. But no roxy dogs, please. I like the greek stuff.",
        "Marina: Okay. I think I can do that. I'll be back in like half an hour. Hey, say hi to sheet rock guy for me. ( Laughs )",
        "Danny: Well, it's about time. I thought you weren't going to show up.",
        "Robbie: Daddy!",
        "Danny: Hey, buddy. What... hey. What... what are you doing here?",
        "Michelle: I have an errand that I needed to run and I was wondering if...",
        "Danny: Absolutely. I think I've got an extra hard hat around here somewhere.",
        "Robbie: Yay!",
        "Danny: Oh, yeah. Come here. Let's see. Try this one. Will it fit? Looks good. You want to draw? Yeah. Will that keep you busy for awhile? Come here. All right. Here I'll tell you what. Here. You can draw on this. You just draw... here. You can draw on this paper, okay. Here.",
        "Michelle: Thanks. Thanks a lot.",
        "Danny: For what? For taking my kid?",
        "Michelle: Well, and not only that. Tony tells me you guys are going to be working together.",
        "Danny: We'll see how it goes.",
        "Michelle: Well, you two guys getting along means a lot to me. Thank you.",
        "Olivia: This isn't about my place at spaulding. It is about my daughter. I am the only thing keeping alan from getting his hooks into her. And I am sorry about harley. But when you have a child...",
        "Bill: Harley has children, olivia.",
        "Olivia: Yes, and she understands. She told me as much. You have to put your child first.",
        "Bill: I get that. It's like you couldn't you found another way to help yourself here?",
        "Olivia: There was no time.",
        "Bill: Olivia...",
        "Olivia: Alan moves too fast.",
        "Bill: Look, if you thought you weren't doing anything wrong, then why wouldn't you tell me about it? You should have told me about this?",
        "Olivia: Why didn't you tell me the things that you did in the past?",
        "Bill: Would you stop turning this around? I thought we told the truth when things really mattered. This matters. You should have told me what was going on here.",
        "Olivia: Well, I guess i couldn't risk it. Sorry. Okay, I messed up. We'll do better next time. I promise. Please, can we just go home?",
        "Bill: Do what you've got to do. I'm staying here.",
        "Harley: I didn't go there to shoot phillip. I went there to get my kids back.",
        "Jeffrey: Of course you did. And he didn't give them to you. He wouldn't give you your children. He wouldn't give you your babies. And he taunted you and he threatened you and he pushed you. You snapped of course.",
        "Harley: Yes. I mean, no. Not the way that you mean. No.",
        "Jeffrey: And he put a gun in front of you. He dared you. He just dared you to do something about it, didn't he?",
        "Gus: Objection. That is speculation.",
        "Jeffrey: Withdrawn. And what about your house? He had someone come over and bulldoze your house down. Someone tore your house down.",
        "Harley: Yes.",
        "Jeffrey: And your father had a heart attack. That was his fault wasn't it? You blamed phillip for that.",
        "Harley: Yes.",
        "Jeffrey: And he's not giving you your babies back and you can't take it anymore. You've had it. You've had enough, haven't you?",
        "Gus: Objection.",
        "Jeffrey: You've had it!",
        "Harley: Yes.",
        "Jeffrey: And that's why you killed him, isn't it? That's why you shot him. Say it.",
        "Harley: I don't know if i killed him.",
        "Gus: Objection, you honor. He's badgering the witness.",
        "Jeffrey: You killed him, didn't him? ( Voices echoing ) you killed him. Say the truth. Come on, harley, say it. You killed him. Say it, harley. Say it, harley.",
        "Alan: Harley cooper shot my son in cold blood, your honor.",
        "Jeffrey: Harley, we need to hear the words. Say the truth. From you. Say the truth. Say the truth.",
        "Gus: She's innocent. She's innocent. She's innocent.",
        "Jeffrey: Answer the question, harley. Did you shoot phillip?",
        "Harley: No, I didn'T. Coming up on \"guiding light\"...",
        "Olivia: You told bill that i was the one who took the picture.",
        "Alan: Olivia, you and bill are different breeds. He's one of them and you're one of me.",
        "Gus: Be true to the feeling in your heart. She didn't do this. Send her home to her children where she belongs.",
        "Michelle: Well, you know you seem really happy.",
        "Danny: Yeah. You, too?",
        "Michelle: Oh yeah, I'm good. I'm good.",
        "Danny: Good. Looks like you're putting your life back together.",
        "Michelle: I am. I am and you know you deserve some credit for that, because you've helped me with that more than I admit it.",
        "Danny: Mm-hmm. I know.",
        "Harley: I did not kill phillip. I did not shoot him.",
        "Jeffrey: How can you be sure?",
        "Harley: I don't know everything that happened that night, but I know myself. And I know my heart. And I didn't do this. I could not have done this.",
        "Jeffrey: You just told the court again that you don't have a complete memory of the events of that night.",
        "Harley: This isn't about memory. I know I did not pull that trigger.",
        "Jeffrey: If you say so. No further questions.",
        "Harley: ( Crying )",
        "Jeffrey: Redirect, your honor.",
        "Gus: Miss cooper, how are you so sure that you did not shoot phillip spaulding?",
        "Harley: I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to pretend that this makes sense. I was a police office officer. I know what the evidence looks like. Yes, yes, I was beyond angry with phillip. He had my boys. He made me beg for my children. I was terrified I would never see them again. These were my children. They're my whole life. You know, children they teach you to love in a way that you never thought possible. Unconditional love. Everything I do is for them. I opened an agency to help the helpless for them, because of them. Because I wanted my children to grow up in a world where... where people help each other. I wanted them to see another standard of love, of humanity. So I'm sorry. I don't remember. But I know I didn't do this. Because it goes against everything... everything that i am. Everything that my boys means to me. Everything I'm teaching them. And that they've taught me. How could I look into my son's eyes knowing that I had taken his father from him? I couldn'T. I didn'T. I know that. I feel it.",
        "Gus: Nothing further, judge.",
        "Tammy: You were about to say something.",
        "Sandy: I was about to say something. That doesn't mean I have anything to say. Okay, you want to know what i was about to say? That you're more important to me than anything. And then I was going to ask if you would just pack up and move back to the apartment and leave all of this behind.",
        "Tammy: You know it's your fault I'm doing this. Couple months ago, I would have been out of here so fast. But you built me up. You were my rock at a time when I really could have hurt myself. You taught me how to be strong.",
        "Sandy: You've always had it in you. I saw it from the first time we met. ( Phone rings ) ( mumbling ) let it ring. Hold that thought. What do you want? Oh, no. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I'll be there. Lewis business. But I can just tell...",
        "Tammy: Come back as soon as you can.",
        "Sandy: Okay.",
        "Tammy: Okay. I'll be waiting.",
        "Sandy: Okay. Save me some of this.",
        "Jonathan: Hi. Waiting for someone?",
        "Girl: I have a date?",
        "Jonathan: That's what I just said. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. Okay. Striking out on finding a girl who just wants to have a cup of coffee, you know? A slice of pie? Do you like pie? I'm staying at the clayton arms. They have a great, great key lime pie. So you say you have a date?",
        "Girl: Not really. I'm not so into key lime.",
        "Jonathan: Peach. You look like a peach pie kind of girl.",
        "Girl: I've never done anything like this before.",
        "Jonathan: Like what?",
        "Girl: Going out with someone I've never even seen before.",
        "Jonathan: Where are you from?",
        "Girl: Oakdale.",
        "Jonathan: Straight off the farm. You know what? This isn't going to work. I'm not the kind of guy you want. And I don't want you either, okay. So go home before you get eaten up, little girl.",
        "Danny: Hey.",
        "Marina: Hi. I'm sorry. I--",
        "Danny: No, no, no. Come in. Come in.",
        "Michelle: Come in. Actually, I've got to go. Danny's going to watch robbie for me while I run an errand.",
        "Marina: Okay.",
        "Michelle: Looks like you guys are having a feast.",
        "Marina: It's just lunch. Hey, robbie, I am glad you are here. I've got lots of cookies.",
        "Danny: Cookies!",
        "Michelle: Not many cookies though. All right. All right.",
        "Danny: Oh, no.",
        "Michelle: All right, I'm going to come back for you in a little while to pick you up, okay. Thanks. Thanks, guys.",
        "Danny: Sure. Thanks for bringing lunch. Hey. What? What? No. Stop it. You did not interrupt anything. Stop. Stop.",
        "Marina: I can't help it. Danny, every time I see you and michelle and robbie, I see a family.",
        "Danny: Marina...",
        "Marina: I'm watching my family falling apart right now and it is killing me. I can't stand to watch it happen to you, too.",
        "Danny: Marina, we're still a family. It's just different that's all. But the good news is, you're here now. Right, buddy? Aren't we glad that marina's here? Yeah. You want to give marina a hug? Yeah.",
        "Olivia: How unlike you. You usually like to wait until the guillotine falls.",
        "Alan: You should have seen the display that harley put on in there. All of sudden she doesn't feel that she killed phillip, because she's got so much love for mankind in her heart. What's worst-- I think it may be working.",
        "Olivia: What is it you want, alan?",
        "Alan: What's with this attitude, olivia? Are you worried that the heat may come back on you now?",
        "Olivia: You told bill that i was the one who took the picture.",
        "Alan: Olivia, you and bill are different breeds. He's one of them and you're one of me.",
        "Jeffrey: Ladies and gentlemen, phillip spaulding was behaving very erratically and was not a very nice person at the end of his life. But that is not a crime. And that is not a crime punishable by death. Now it has been proven in this court well beyond a reasonable doubt that harley cooper had the motive, the means and the opportunity. She was in the restaurant with phillip spaulding the night that he was murdered with a gun. She even confessed to the crime. Now I know you were very moved by harley's testimony as was I. I mean, you wouldn't be human if you weren'T. But, now, it's up to you to move beyond the emotion and to look to the evidence in this case and you will see that you can not come to any other conclusion or any other verdict. Because as much as we wish it wasn't true, harley cooper murdered somebody. And she's guilty of the murder of phillip spaulding.",
        "Gus: Ladies and gentlemen, this case is what's called circumstantial. It is not air tight. There's no definitive proof that harley cooper shot anybody or even held a gun. But the fact of the matter is that you yourselves saw half a dozen people right on this witness stand that had an equally strong motive, same opportunity as miss cooper. Today, just now you saw the defendant agonize and search her heart and her soul and dig down to see if she's capable of murder. She found out in her heart the answer is no. She's not. Miss cooper is a wonderful woman. She's the greatest mom I've ever met. I know this. She has saved people's lives as a police office. I was there. I saw it. She has a non- profit organization for battered women. She didn't do this. The prosecution would have you check your heart at the deliberation door. They want you to ignore the fact that there is insufficient, credible, inadmissible evidence to convict miss cooper. I say do the opposite. I say be true to the feeling in your heart. She didn't do this. Send her home to her children where she belongs. ( knock at the door )",
        "Jonathan: Tammy!",
        "Michelle: Did you have fun with your dad and marina? Was it good? Yeah. You know, you're a pretty popular guy today. Because uncle rick called and he said that zach and jude were just dying to see you. So we're going to wait here until they get here. That sound good?",
        "Robbie: More cookies.",
        "Michelle: No more cookies. How about more hugs? How about hugs? Give me hugs. ( Laughs ) you're addicted to those cookies, aren't you?",
        "Messenger: Michelle santos?",
        "Michelle: Yes.",
        "Messenger: Sign here.",
        "Michelle: Thanks.",
        "Messenger: You're welcome.",
        "Robbie: What's that?",
        "Michelle: I don't know. Let me see. They are legal papers. They're papers say that you daddy and mommy can change their lives. You know, like we can live in different places and have different friends. Hey, you know what? There's one thing that's never ever going to change for your daddy and me, okay. We're always going to love you more than anything in the whole world. You got that?",
        "Danny: Oh, thank you. This is for me?",
        "Messenger: Yeah.",
        "Danny: I can look at it later. It's just a bunch of, you know, legalese stuff.",
        "Marina: Well, you don't have to pretend with me, danny. It's important stuff.",
        "Danny: Yeah, I know. It's the end of something. But I don't want to dwell on that. I'd rather dwell on you.",
        "Marina: Right. ( Laughs ) you are at the end of life as you knew it and I am falling apart.",
        "Danny: But when I look at you, I see the beginning of something new.",
        "Judge: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you have heard all the testimony. It is now time to start your deliberation.",
        "Olivia: Are you such a miserable angry man, you can't stand to let anyone else to be happy?",
        "Alan: You know that's not true. I've had my moments of happiness.",
        "Olivia: That was a long time ago.",
        "Alan: You know people like you and people like me, olivia, we don't do happy. We're too wrapped up in our own desire to make happiness last. You have no choice. You know that.",
        "Olivia: Bill gave me a choice.",
        "Alan: He gave you a choice and you blew it. You've got a bigger problem now, because if she is acquitted your neck is on the chopping block.",
        "Gus: I can't tell how sorry i am for letting you down. Again.",
        "Harley: You didn't let me down. You held my hand. You believed in me. Made me realize I'm not a killer. You stood up for me when i wouldn't stand up for myself. That's love. And for loving me that much, i will always be grateful no matter what happens.",

        "Dinah: Besides, if cassie came home, it wouldn't be good if she finds me here.",
        "Edmund: Dinah, you're not going anywhere. I want you to send for your things. I want you to stay here.",
        "Tammy: Oh, my god. I must have fallen asleep.",
        "Jonathan: I'll get you out of here.",
