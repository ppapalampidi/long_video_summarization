        "Alan: Well, gentlemen, thank you all for coming.",
        "Billy: Alan, what are we doing here?",
        "Alan: I had to see phillip and I wanted to speak with you. So two birds with one stone.",
        "Josh: I don't think he was talk about location.",
        "Buzz: Why do we have to drop everything and come here?",
        "Alan: It's about mary ann and carrie. I promise you what I have to say will make your trip worthwhile.",
        "Gus: Just the man I was looking for.",
        "Rick: Is jude okay?",
        "Gus: Jude's fine. Home with harley. I have to talk to you about something private.",
        "Rick: Sure, let's go over here.",
        "Gus: Thank you.",
        "Rick: You're welcome what's up?",
        "Gus: I have a drug problem I'm trying to sort out.",
        "Rick: Drugs?",
        "Gus: Yeah. I need to get some...",
        "Rick: How long has it been going on?",
        "Gus: That's the thing. I'm new to this.",
        "Rick: Does harley know about it?",
        "Gus: She can't help me. I need to get some info.",
        "Rick: I never saw it coming but cedars has some excellent programs. You've taken the first step. Now comes the difficult part.",
        "Gus: What are we talking about?",
        "Rick: Your drug problem?",
        "Gus: No. Antimonious is the problem. Delirium: Street name \"D.\" I'm back on the street. Back on the force.",
        "Rick: I'm just messing with you. What do you want to know?",
        "Gus: You did think. Everything.",
        "Jeffrey: Stan, you got my messages? Stan's on a break. But you do have one message.",
        "Jeffrey: \"Finish what you started, mr. O'neill.\" And who is this from?",
        "Cassie: Me. You know what I'm talking about. The gym?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, I remember the gym when you more or less called me a liar. I thought we were done with that conversation.",
        "Cassie: Well, I'm not. I asked you about that picture of you and christopher langham. All you gave me were half truths which are half lies, totally unacceptable.",
        "Jeffrey: I thought they were perfectly acceptable half lies.",
        "Cassie: So, you admit it.",
        "Jeffrey: I admit to nothing mrs. Winslow, except I've had a very long day and I would like nothing more than to go up to my room and have some peace and quiet.",
        "Cassie: You saw marah again, didn't you?",
        "Reporter: There she is.",
        "Reporter: Why did you shoot caroline curruthers?",
        "Reporter: How long have you been sleeping with jeffrey o'neill?",
        "Marah: Leave me alone, please!",
        "Tony: Get on.",
        "Marah: Tony?",
        "Tony: Get on, let's go. (Motorcycle engine revying)",
        "Billy: You better not be messing with us, alan. If there is something new with maryanne curruthers and that aunt of hers.",
        "Alan: There is something new billy, but it's good news for you all.",
        "Buzz: Alan, come on. Just say it.",
        "Alan: I have cut a deal with the district attorney about mary ann's involvement in her death. (All talking at once disapproving) even if it saves you all from being prosecuted? I told the district attorney that I was the only one in the car that night when it went over the bridge. I took-- me-- I took full responsibility.",
        "Josh: They know that we were all there.",
        "Alan: Yes, that is the deal i cut with the district attorney and that is the deal he accepted.",
        "Billy: What's in it for you? I've known the guy for years. There is no way we are going to believe that you waltzed in there and gave yourself up out of the goodness of your heart.",
        "Alan: Well, you know I wish that were the case, billy, but it wasn'T. Actually, I traded information.",
        "Buzz: What kind of information?",
        "Alan: Information about spaulding enterprises.",
        "Buzz: You traded the company secrets for us?",
        "Alan: Yes, I did. So, congratulations, gentlemen. You're now all off the hook.",
        "Olivia: Hello? Who's there? Oh, marina, you scared the life out of me.",
        "Marina: I'm sorry.",
        "Olivia: Oh, my gosh.",
        "Marina: I guess you're taking the same shortcut as I am.",
        "Olivia: How are you?",
        "Marina: Okay.",
        "Olivia: Are you in a rush to get somewhere? I haven't seen you in a while.",
        "Marina: Going to dad's to see a late movie. Maybe spend the night.",
        "Olivia: Nice being able to go home to dad. You've had a rough time the past few months. I'm sorry, sweetheart.",
        "Marina: I guess we both had a rough time. I'm really trying just to get back to normal. I feel like nothing in my family is the way it was a few months ago. Everything seems up side down still. So, how is phillip? And I don't really hang out with lizzie that much, so I haven't been keeping up.",
        "Olivia: He is doing as well as expected. How is shayne?",
        "Marina: He is so amazing.",
        "Olivia: Yeah?",
        "Marina: Yeah. He is almost back on his feet again.",
        "Olivia: He's a great kid. I'm walking home. Do you want to with me? That way your dad and darcy won't get too worried.",
        "Marina: Let me..",
        "Frank: All right, hold it right there, ladies.",
        "Lizzie: Leave her alone, I'm trying to follow her.",
        "Cassie: You're not supposed to see marah.",
        "Jeffrey: I'm well aware of that, thank you.",
        "Cassie: Then why did you?",
        "Jeffrey: It's none of your business, is it?",
        "Cassie: My niece is my business, mr. O'neill, so try again.",
        "Jeffrey: I went to see her. That's all.",
        "Cassie: What happened?",
        "Jeffrey: Your niece-- not unlike you-- is very stubborn. She insists upon going before the grand jury. I was trying to let her know what she might be in for. Of course she's so busy defending me, that she can't help herself. She continues down that path, doris wolf is going to pick her up like a sitting duck.",
        "Cassie: Were you able to help marah see that?",
        "Jeffrey: I think I was a little hard on her. You know, she'S... she's sensitive. She's very gentle. She's not like you. You can do battle with the best of them, can't you?",
        "Cassie: Yeah, I guess you and I, we're tough guys, huh?",
        "Jeffrey: What? I mean, don't get me wrong. Everyone there this town knows that, you know, you've been dealt some tough blows, but you, you just manage to get yourself right back up and throw yourself right back into the fray every time, don't you? I mean, the hits keep on coming, but you just don't stay down for long. It's a compliment.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, well, take it back. (Phone ringing)",
        "Marah: Don't answer that. It's a reporter.",
        "Tony: How do you know reporters?",
        "Marah: Fine, you want to see for yourself? Told you. So, thank you for getting me out of there.",
        "Tony: I was at the right place at the right time, marah.",
        "Marah: Probably go out the other exits because they're waiting outside that one, I'm sure.",
        "Tony: I'm going to stick around for a while, all right?",
        "Marah: Sure. If you want to spend some quality time with a cold blooded killer, be my guest.",
        "Tony: Marah, don't do this to yourself. Please, don'T.",
        "Marah: You know what? Seriously, you should go. Hanging out with me is going to get you nothing but bad press, tony.",
        "Tony: I'm real concerned about my clean reputation, marah. Listen, please, let me stick around for a while so I know you're all right, for peace of mind, please.",
        "Marah: I'm fine. You want to know how I deal with my day? I get up in the morning and i take a shower. I get out of bed and I go out and shoot somebody. Really.",
        "Tony: Damn it, marah! Stop doing it to yourself, please.",
        "Marah: You have to admit how ironic there is. Now I'm probably now the perfect girl for you. Matching his-and-her gun holsters. We can frame our mug-shots together. We would be the perfect happy couple.",
        "Tony: Damn it, marah, stop it. Please, let it go.",
        "Marah: Let it go! Let it go! How do I let it go! I killed a woman! I picked up a gun and I shot her and I killed her! How do you want me to let that go! God, I spent so much time telling you how wrong it was to fight violence with violence and I do the same thing. (Phone ringing) how do I get through what I did? (Phone ringing)",
        "Tony: Marah. (Phone ringing)",
        "Cassie: We don't know enough about me to be making assumptions. I mean, just because we've had a few fights doesn't mean I walk around here looking for a fray.",
        "Jeffrey: Take it easy. I'm just saying, from the little bit I do know about you, I can tell you're a survivor. That's a good thing, an admirable thing. I just hope that it runs in the family.",
        "Cassie: Marah's strong.",
        "Jeffrey: I'm not sure she has that kind of fight in her. When I left her, I hurt her.",
        "Cassie: I'm sorry. You had to do it. You have to stay away from her until this is all over.",
        "Jeffrey: I'm not in the habit of asking favors, especially not from you. But promise me that you will take care of her, and that you'll do everything that you can, you know, to help her.",
        "Cassie: I promise you that marah will not be alone. We're all going to be with her.",
        "Jeffrey: Thank you.",
        "Edmund: Don't worry, mr. O'neill. Your secret is safe with us. I'm sorry. I thought were you talking about the picture I found between you and mr. Langham. Cassie said she was going to speak to you about it.",
        "Jeffrey: Next time you want to do some research, come to me directly. Your questions don't bother me. But in this case, they may have undermined reva's confidence with dr. Langham, someone who she needs very much right now. Now if you'll excuse me.",
        "Edmund: The man never lets me down. Complete and total arrogance.",
        "Cassie: He's right. About what?",
        "Cassie: That picture has done nothing but shake reva's confidence in christopher. She does need him right now. Why couldn't you just leave this alone? (Phone ringing)",
        "Marah: You know, I finally understand what it's like to be you. To have people looking at you, judging you, just waiting for you to snap.",
        "Tony: No one thinks that about, you, marah.",
        "Marah: Oh, really? You think these calls are from supporters?",
        "Tony: Marah, the reason you were you backed into a corner by fired that gun is because you were you backed into a corner by a lunatic, that's all. That's why you did it.",
        "Marah: At the end of the day, that lunatic is still dead because of me.",
        "Tony: It's not the same. You were trying to save your father's life, and you did. Look at me, please. You saved your father's life, marah. The things I did, the reasons... it doesn't matter, does it get to me sometimes, yes, it does. But I get over it and I'm telling you, you will get over this.",
        "Marah: I'm not going to get over it.",
        "Tony: You're not going to get over it by talking the way you are.",
        "Marah: What am I supposed to do?",
        "Tony: I want you to listen to me. Listen to me. This is going to eat you up inside. Marah, you have got to let this go. Please. When you wake up in the middle of the night because you cannot shake what happened, I do not want you to think about what you did. I want you to think why, why you did this, marah. I want you to think how that woman manipulated all of you. Listen to me, please. I want you to think, I want you to think about that person who died could have been you or anyone you love, marah. I'm telling you that.",
        "Marah: You want me to think... the only thing I can think about tony is the guilt that I am feeling. You what? You want me to be grateful?",
        "Tony: Yes, I do, marah. Look at me! I want you to be grateful because I'm grateful that I'm standing here with you face to face, that can I look at you, marah, instead of standing over your grave.",
        "Gus: All right, well just give me all the information on the \"D.\"",
        "Rick: Huge drug in asia right now.",
        "Gus: I know that and in europe, but I'm just going to worry about springfield right now. Save the rest of the world another time. Hit me. What's the deal?",
        "Rick: We're seeing more and more cases with that drug-- especially with kids right now. They're get it on the street, get the tablets, drop it in their drinks. More severe cases use it in powder form, snort it or shoot it up.",
        "Gus: A nightmare being a parent these days. You have another one on the way, don't you?",
        "Rick: Any day now. But getting back to what we are talking about, you can do everything right as a parent. You think you got it completely covered, but the fact is, it can happen to anybody.",
        "Gus: Right. And how can you tell if someone is on it? If you see them and they walk in here.",
        "Rick: That's the problem. The drug affects people in different ways. It just tends to amplify certain behaviors you might be prone to. Excuse me a second.",
        "Gus: Yeah.",
        "Rick: Baby!",
        "Gus: Ba-- well, congratulations! (Pager rings) hey, it's me. Where are you? Okay. I'll just... stay put. I'll be right there.",
        "Frank: You've got five minutes because I'm on my way home. All right. All right, ladies, I will save you the lecture of why you should not be in the park at this hour.",
        "Olivia: Thanks.",
        "Marina: What are you doing in the park, tough guy.",
        "Frank: Well this tough guy was taking a shortcut in the park to beat you home to put popcorn on for movie night.",
        "Olivia: It must be nice to go home to dad.",
        "Frank: I wish I could keep her there, but... olivia, why don't you join us, please. I'm certain darcy rented some chick flick. Misery loves company. I'm teasing. The more the merrier.",
        "Olivia: I have to take a rain check. It's late and I get up so early these days. I go to see phillip first thing in the morning.",
        "Frank: That's all right. I'll take you up on that rain check. But you know what? You guys should leave right now because it's getting very late and I'd like to watch you walk out. Okay? Make sure you're safe.",
        "Marina: Aren't you coming?",
        "Frank: No, I'll be there shortly. I've got a little business to take care of. I want to watch you walk to the end of the park.",
        "Olivia: He's really bossy. See you, frank.",
        "Frank: You, too, olivia. Straight home.",
        "Gus: Frank, is this your nightly cult meeting.",
        "Frank: The weather changes at night, people want to take shortcuts through park. Look, I don't have time for this, so make it quick.",
        "Gus: Fine. I want to know if we're going ahead to do the thing.",
        "Frank: I don't think you should be doing anything because in my opinion, you're the last person in the world who should be a cop.",
        "Ed: So it's over?",
        "Alan: At least this part. I was the one who drugged maryanne. I was the one driving the car. I was the one that convinced all of you to turn your back and walk away, which started the nightmare. Now I think it only is fitting that I should take full responsibility, and I did.",
        "Billy: With a little persuasion.",
        "Alan: I will admit that my back was against the wall, but no matter what the result is, maryanne curruthers case is over. None of you will be prosecuted. So you can now go and live your lives out.",
        "Josh: Thank you, alan.",
        "Billy: I've...",
        "Buzz: I've lived with the secret so long, I don't know if I can remember what it's like to live without it.",
        "Billy: I feel a little lighter. (Phone ringing)",
        "Ed: Hello. Oh, my, god.",
        "Tony: I'm telling you guys for the last time, get hell out of here! Go! (Phone ringing) marah, I just want you to know that I am glad you're all right. I am.",
        "Marah: I just want all of this to end.",
        "Tony: I know you do. I know that, and it will. I mean, the odds are your case won't even go to trial. There are plenty of witnesses ready to tell the court right now that you fired the gun based on self-defense.",
        "Marah: You know what, tony? It almost doesn't matter what happens in that courtroom. I'll punish myself for the rest of my life.",
        "Tony: You're scaring me, marah. What does that mean?",
        "Marah: Do you ever think I'll be able to wake up in the morning, open my eyes and not remember what I did. I'm not even me anymore.",
        "Tony: Damn it, marah. You are you. You are you and you have to hold on to that, please. For me, do that.",
        "Marah: It doesn't matter how you were you brought up or raised, or what friends you have your values you think you have. None of that, none of that can keep you safe. One instant, one thing goes wrong, one wrong person comes into your life and it's over. Everything can change just like that.",
        "Tony: That's exactly what i was always afraid of for you, marah. And I never wanted to be that person. I didn'T.",
        "Marah: I'm fine.",
        "Tony: No, marah, you're not fine. Please.",
        "Marah: I'm sorry.",
        "Tony: Why are you apologizing? Sorry for what, marah?",
        "Marah: For always blaming you for a past that you can't change. I always said I didn't hold it against you, but you always told me I did. And you were right. I think you should go.",
        "Tony: No. I'm not leaving.",
        "Marah: I'm fine!",
        "Tony: You're not fine.",
        "Marah: I don't want to talk! Tony, I'm all talked out! I just want to be alone!",
        "Tony: Yeah, it's tony. I need to find the boss.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, I found the picture.",
        "Cassie: I know that, edmund. It's what led to you find the picture that scares me, okay? I know you have worked very hard to get rid of those bad habits, but then I find out you're investigating jeffrey o'neill? I'm just worried that those instincts are still there.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, I think those instincts will always be there, but I promise I will do my best to make sure they never get the best of me. All right. I'll give you some time to deal with that, and I'll just....",
        "Cassie: Wait. Wait. If we're going to deal with anything, we're going to deal with it together.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, I'm sorry if that picture has caused your sister any pain, I am. But I won't apologize for finding it. My mistake was not letting you know what I was up to, and i will. I promise. I will let you in on every decision I'm making. You may not agree with my decision.",
        "Cassie: Probably not.",
        "Edmund: But at least you won't be kept in the dark.",
        "Cassie: So is this the apology we didn't give each other before?",
        "Edmund: I think it is.",
        "Cassie: Do you think we can get to the make-up part?",
        "Buzz: Ed, what is it? What happened?",
        "Ed: That was rick. Mel's going into labor.",
        "Buzz: Well, hey, to new beginnings. Good news.",
        "Josh: Twice in one hour. Let's get to cedars.",
        "Ed: Are you going to come?",
        "Buzz: Of course. Let's go.",
        "Alan: Congratulations, ed. New beginnings, huh? I just don't think either one of us is ready for that. Still have a lot of issues in front of me with my family, and you have your daughter.",
        "Josh: It's tough when your kids are hurting.",
        "Alan: Yeah, to think about all the inconsequential things we have been caught up in over the years, josh, we've really butted heads over things, haven't we?",
        "Josh: Yes, we have.",
        "Alan: I just hope the next generation doesn't make the same mistakes we did. I understand that bill is taking over lewis construction.",
        "Josh: That's right, he is. I'm sure once phillip is feeling better, he'll start running spaulding again. Who knows, maybe they'll be better at working together than we ever were.",
        "Alan: Well, I hope so, the they don't eat each other alive first. I know it's ridiculous to think that all the feuding going on between us over the years is just water under the bridge.",
        "Josh: There's been a lot of water. It would have to be a pretty big bridge.",
        "Alan: But maybe we can start by trying to build it again.",
        "Josh: What you did today for us, that was a pretty good start.",
        "Alan: Thanks.",
        "Gus: Now you're saying i shouldn't even be a cop.",
        "Frank: What I think you should be doing is making up your own mind if you are going to catch the bad guys or you're going to work for them.",
        "Gus: Frank, come on. Alan, might not be one of the good guys but he is my father.",
        "Frank: That's exactly the problem. Your father is under federal investigation and you're too emotionally involved.",
        "Gus: That would work for me, not against me. I have to take care of this drug thing, okay? Alan, I can't let him take a hit for something like this. Just put the shoe on the other foot, if it was your father, you'd do the same thing.",
        "Frank: I'm a little smarter than you are. I got better common sense, better knowledge.",
        "Gus: How? Frank, just think about it. This would be the perfect time for me to come back.",
        "Frank: I don't want my sister to go through anymore stress. One day you're in, the next day you're out.",
        "Gus: I would never do anything to hurt harley. She is the first one to protect family. She would understand what I'm about to do.",
        "Edmund: I'm glad the apology went so well.",
        "Cassie: Why is that?",
        "Edmund: I have a very romantic evening planned for you and would I hate toy sew it go and would I hate toy sew it go to waste. But we have time before dinner reservations, if you would like to go....",
        "Cassie: I have something to talk to you about.",
        "Edmund: All right.",
        "Cassie: Jeffrey o'neill.",
        "Edmund: Oh, can we find five minutes in the day where that man doesn't exist.",
        "Cassie: We can't do that. With everything going on with marah, jeffrey has proven himself to be her hero.",
        "Edmund: Hero?",
        "Cassie: Yeah, I know. I can't believe I said it and as much as I hate to admit it, he has really been there for her.",
        "Edmund: All right. All right, fine. Peaps in a legal sense.",
        "Cassie: In every sense.",
        "Edmund: Let's not forget who we're talking about here. While the man appears... and i repeat appears to care about your niece, I doubt he cares that much. As a matter of fact, I think when this whole carrie carruthers things starts to cramp his style, it he will bail on marah.",
        "Cassie: It has cramped his style and he is still there.",
        "Edmund: How do you know that?",
        "Cassie: Because we were just talking about her.",
        "Edmund: This is the man you used to swear up and down was not to be trusted.",
        "Cassie: Yes, I know that.",
        "Edmund: What's changed?",
        "Cassie: Nothing, nothing has changed. I don't know. Okay? I just think that if he's on her side, and we're on her side, that means we're all on the same side. So you probably shouldn't have jeffrey investigated.",
        "Edmund: Okay, but cassie, the information I've found on jeffrey o'neill has absolutely nothing to do with marah. So I'm failing to see the logic here.",
        "Cassie: Please, edmund.",
        "Edmund: Fine. I will stop looking for dirt on jeffrey o'neill.",
        "Cassie: Thank you.",
        "Tony: Mr. Lewis, you got a few minutes.",
        "Josh: Hello, tony.",
        "Tony: I know I'm probably the last person you want to see right now.",
        "Josh: No, that's not true. You were there for my family during some difficult times. And regardless of the way things turned out between you and marah I've always known that you care about her.",
        "Tony: I do. I still do. I care about what happens to her",
        "Josh: Is that why you're looking for me? You want to know how I can help.",
        "Tony: To be honest, I think that marah is beyond my help. I was just with her and she is extremely... I've never seen her like this. She is extremely shaken up and i think you should know that the press was after her in the park.",
        "Josh: What was she doing in the park?",
        "Tony: I'm not quite sure. I got her home. Once I got her home, I hung around to make sure she was okay.",
        "Josh: And she wasn't?",
        "Tony: I wouldn't have left her but she practically kicked me out. I think it's not only the press thing that's bugging her, i think it's something bigger than that.",
        "Josh: Well, she has been under a lot of stress, you know, the shock...",
        "Tony: Shock wears off. Guilt doesn'T.",
        "Josh: But she acted in self- defense. She knows that.",
        "Tony: That's what she keeps saying to herself and everyone else keeps telling her, but in her head, I'm telling you, she is a girl who pick up a gun and shot someone.",
        "Josh: There are several witnesses, including myself, who know that... who saw that she had to shoot caroline curruthers.",
        "Tony: If you line up the witnesses around the block, it's not going to matter to marah. It's not. She doesn't care what goes on in that courtroom. To her she is guilty. She has convinced herself she is guilty and she is going to punish herself whether the law says it or not.",
        "Tony: I've been there. The type of guilt that mar as feeling right now is kind of guilt that eats you up and just wears you down. And if you do nothing about it, I'm telling you, you become like this lost shell of a person. You're empty.",
        "Josh: Is that right?",
        "Tony: I just don't want marah to forget who she is, and since I'm not around very often...",
        "Josh: Is that why you tracked me down?",
        "Tony: I just don't want her to lose herself, mr. Lewis.",
        "Josh: Okay. I'll keep an eye on her.",
        "Tony: Thank you.",
        "Josh: Tony, what you said about not being around for marah to remind her who she is, it doesn't have to be that way. A friend like you could be a great comfort to her right now.",
        "Tony: I'm not exactly what she needs, mr. Lewis. I am the exact kind of thing that reminds her what a man would do when his back is up against the wall and the lengths that he would go. I am that constant reminder of what she's trying to forget, but thank you. I will say though, if your family ever needs anything, I am always here.",
        "Josh: I appreciate that.",
        "Tony: Thank you.",
        "Josh: Thank you for looking out for her. She has a great strength. She might surprise us all.",
        "Tony: I was just concerned. Thank you. Incomplete misdirected (phone ringing) unfulfilled vacant heart (phone ringing)",
        "Marah: Stop! Stop calling me! God! I want so much more I can't take it I live in a fairy tale world my friends.",
        "Rick: Dad! You made it. Oh, my gosh, where have you been?",
        "Ed: How's mel.",
        "Rick: She's great. She is in labor and you know when you're in labor, baby is not far behind, but you know that. You're a doctor, but what am i doing talking to you? I got to get back in there.",
        "Ed: Go. You got a great kid coming on.",
        "Buzz: You know, it's almost like I'm afraid to feel it.",
        "Billy: Feel what?",
        "Buzz: Something good, something hopeful. Been a long time.",
        "Ed: Haven't let my guard down in months.",
        "Billy: I think it's high time you did.",
        "Buzz: It's not that easy.",
        "Billy: I think it is. I mean, let's go over what we got here. Ed is about to be a grandfather again. And you, well you've got a family that loves you and a town that loves your chili. (Laughter) and a daughter who is going to need to you walk her down the aisle again real soon. And me, my boy took over my company. I couldn't be prouder. And little brother, he's got all of us to help him help marah get through this thing, and we will see it through.",
        "Ed: It's like when you get ready to give up, I mean just at that point you get thrown another curve and all of a sudden you got something new to... I don't know, get excited about. I mean, a new baby.",
        "Buzz: New start.",
        "Billy: A new start. That sounds real good.",
        "Lizzie: Just want to see what's in the bag, olivia. I think it's the key to whatever you're hiding.",
        "Olivia: You know what? I'll heat something up if I get hungry. I'm in for the night so you can go.",
        "Lizzie: What's going on in there? Making this a little difficult on me. That's okay. Tomorrow's another day.",
        "Buzz: Next on \"guiding light\"...",
        "Phillip: I was just telling dr. Langham that somebody around here would like to keep me locked up as a prisoner in this hop.",
        "Reva: (Gasps) do not do that!",
        "Harley: Safe and sound, just like carrie and know how she did it."
