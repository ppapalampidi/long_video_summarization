        "Bill calls his future bride and tells her he is overseeing the caterers and florists and everything is beautiful. He tells her to forget everything else and get over there to be his bride. Ridge is still there and he tells her they have a history and he knows he screwed up, but ..that was his last. He will go to her house and wait for her. He tells his secretary that he needs the rest of the day off; Steffy can handle anything. Quinn comes in and he tells her the same thing. He is going home and hopes to be married today. Quinn relays her conversation with Brooke and she reminded Brooke that whatever they had was over. Ridge says he realizes what they did could cost him Brooke but he is going to her house and hopes to change her mind. Liam and Wyatt come in and make some funnies and Bill tells Justin to write it up; they are out of his will. He tells them they can believe not only in his vows but actions, unlike Forrester who is all talk but no follow through. Ridge had his chance and he blew it. He will not get another. Katie helps Brooke get ready but wants to be sure that she is really going through with this. When she puts that dress on she could marry either Ridge or Bill.",
        "Ivy finds that Quinn is distracted. Quinn calls Bill and says she guesses the ceremony has not started yet. He wonders why she even cares as they are not besties. Bill says he does not know what happened with Ridge but he intends to find out why Brooke walked out on him. Quinn confides that Ridge is still thinking in those terms and she hopes he does not pull something. Bill tells her that Brooke knows who she wants and it is him. There is not a damn thing Ridge can do to stop it. Katie tells Brooke it is her life and she will support whatever she does. And she admits all she sees is Quinn's devotion to Eric and nothing now between her and Ridge. So it is up to Brooke who she marries \u0096 Ridge or Bill. Ivy tells Quinn that she could not help but overhear her conversation with Bill and she supposes it is possible that Brooke could change her mind. Quinn starts thinking of those sexy moments with Ridge ..kissing and in the steam room. Ridge thinks about his moments with Brooke. Wyatt doesn't get it why his mom would call Bill about Ridge's full on press of Brooke. Bill says it is a bunch of bull, all that history and destiny. Her destiny is with him. The door opens and Bill expects Brooke to walk through but no one is there."

        "Bill: Hey, beautiful. I'm here at my house -- well, soon to be our house -- and the caterers and the florists are putting on their last-minute touches. I can't wait to say our vows in the same place we're going to call our home. And then it's off to the jet and our honeymoon. How does that sound?",
        "Brooke: You've thought of everything, as usual.",
        "Bill: So, are you, uh... heading over to Katie's? She's gonna help you get ready?",
        "Brooke: Uh, actually, I'm still at work.",
        "Bill: What? This is your wedding day, woman!",
        "Brooke: I know, it's just -- something came up.",
        "Bill: Well, let Steffy take care of that. That's why she gets the big bucks. I want to make you my bride. Right away, gorgeous. Now! Get over here.",
        "Ridge: Spencer?",
        "Brooke: Yes.",
        "Ridge: He thinks you're getting married.",
        "Brooke: I never said I wasn't.",
        "Ridge: I know you don't want to disappoint him again, but don't make a decision because of that. We have a history, and I know some of it was painful, but... if you've loved as deeply and as intensely as we have, that doesn't just go away, even with my latest screw-up, which I promise will be my last. So, I'm gonna go to your house. And I'm gonna wait for you. When you get there, we'll say our vows to each other, and we'll start our life together. You, me, and R.J.",
        "Liam: This is nice. This is nice, man. Dad, looks like you're getting to be an old pro at this.",
        "Bill: What?",
        "Liam: Putting together weddings on the fly.",
        "Justin: You act like he does this every day.",
        "Wyatt: Well, this is ceremony #3 for him and Brooke.",
        "Liam: It'd sure be nice if this one took.",
        "Wyatt: Right?",
        "Bill: [Laughs] I get it. You're bringing the comedy routine from my office, here.",
        "Liam: Uh-huh. Right. Yeah.",
        "Bill: Right? Well, get a good chuckle out of this. You're both out of the will. Take care of it.",
        "Justin: Now?",
        "Bill: Now.",
        "Wyatt: Don't be hasty!",
        "Liam: Hey!",
        "Wyatt: Learn how to take a joke, why don't you?",
        "Liam: Yeah!",
        "Bill: My wedding to Brooke is nothing to joke about.",
        "Liam: All right, all right. Okay, okay. But I will say, in all seriousness, you and Brooke have put up with countless delays, and it is time for you to cross that finish line.",
        "Bill: [Chuckles] Now you're being a good boy. He's back in the will.",
        "Wyatt: What?",
        "Liam: Yes! Boom!",
        "Wyatt: Such a suck-up.",
        "Justin: So, have you talked to your bride?",
        "Bill: Just before you got here.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, Brooke's on her way?",
        "Bill: She was leaving the office and heading over to Katie's to get ready.",
        "Liam: Why -- why would she be at Forrester on her wedding day?",
        "Wyatt: Uh, any chance ridge is giving one final pitch?",
        "Justin: Or that he's gonna try to show up here to hijack the wedding, again?",
        "Ridge: No, I'm gonna be out of the office for the rest of the day. It's not work-related. It's private. Okay, thank you, pam. Bye.",
        "[Knocks on door]",
        "Quinn: Pam wasn't at her desk.",
        "Ridge: No, I know. She's roaming the halls on her cell phone. I just gave her some instructions.",
        "Quinn: Oh?",
        "Ridge: I'm gonna be out of the office for the rest of the day. I'm going over to Brooke's house.",
        "Quinn: Really? What's going on?",
        "Ridge: Well, if everything works out the way I'm hoping, we're gonna get married today.",
        "Katie: Hey. You're here.",
        "Brooke: Sorry I'm late.",
        "Katie: Oh, that's okay. Was there, um, an emergency at work?",
        "Brooke: Uh, no. Not exactly.",
        "Katie: Well, then what?",
        "Brooke: I was speaking with ridge.",
        "Katie: Oh. Okay. I mean, I -- I saw him earlier, and it's pretty clear that he hasn't given up on you, so... what's going on?",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] What is going on is that I'm getting married today, and I'm so happy that my little sister is here to help me touch up my makeup and hair. What do you think I should do? Should I pull it up a little bit, or just kind of leave it down, natural?",
        "Katie: I think that you'll be beautiful no matter what, as always. Of course, your groom might have an opinion. Unless you've decided that you're not marrying Bill.",
        "Wyatt: Thanks. [Clears throat] So, when's the minister getting here?",
        "Liam: Oh, yeah, you did remember to hire a minister, yes?",
        "Bill: Oh, no. Of course! He's standing right next to you.",
        "Justin: Hey...",
        "Wyatt: What?",
        "Liam: It's Justin!",
        "Justin: Hey, I'm a jack of a all trades. In California, anyone can be a commissioner for a day. It only requires a trip to city hall.",
        "Bill: I thought I was gonna have to pull some strings 'cause it was at the last minute, but my man here...",
        "Justin: No string pulls required. I get a chance to marry my oldest friend to the woman that makes you happier than I've ever seen you. Couldn't be more honored. Yeah.",
        "Wyatt: What about your vows? You get a chance to write anything?",
        "Bill: What's wrong with just speaking from the heart, huh?",
        "Wyatt: Mnh-mnh. No.",
        "Liam: You're gonna do that? Oh, dear.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Bill: Hey, just watch and learn, junior. I am fully committed to Brooke, and not just in my words but in my actions. Unlike Forrester, who's all talk and no follow-through. I'm not that kind of man, and I'm not gonna be that kind of husband, and Brooke knows that. She knows that she can trust me to support her, and that is my vow. To love her and support her and stand by her side no matter what. To protect our marriage until one of us croaks.",
        "Liam: That was impressive.",
        "Bill: Thanks.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. All except for the croak part. That needs a little work...",
        "Justin: Hey. It's no wonder that ridge didn't make the cut. Come on, no one compares or measures up to dollar Bill!",
        "Bill: Well, yeah, and Brooke knows that now. Sure, you know, they have some, uh, memories and they share a son, but it doesn't compare to our memories or the memories we're going to make as husband and wife. Ridge had his chance. He blew it, and he will not get another one with Brooke. Ever.",
        "Quinn: So, you think that's going to happen? You and Brooke?",
        "Ridge: You sound surprised.",
        "Quinn: Well, she's supposed to be marrying Bill today.",
        "Ridge: Well, things can change.",
        "Quinn: Meaning she wants a future with you after all?",
        "Ridge: Yeah. You spent time with her. You must have sensed something.",
        "Quinn: Uh, well, actually, she just kept turning the conversation back onto me.",
        "Ridge: How so?",
        "Quinn: She wanted to know what I would do if I were in her position. Two incredible men wanting to be with her, which one would I choose? I mean, the thought of choosing Bill of course made my stomach turn because...",
        "Ridge: But -- but the thought of me doesn't do that, so I win by default.",
        "Quinn: She -- she also asked me how I would feel if you and she got married.",
        "Ridge: What'd you say?",
        "Quinn: I said of course it wouldn't bother me, and I had to remind her that whatever it was between us, you know, was over.",
        "Ridge: And I was telling her the same thing, but I think today, for the first time, she believed me.",
        "Quinn: Well, maybe that accounts for her divided feelings. Despite the fact that she's still wearing Bill's really ugly engagement ring.",
        "Ridge: Eh, I don't discount their relationship. That obviously is something, but she would be with me if I hadn't screwed up. And what happened between you and me, it could still cost me Brooke, but I'm -- I'm hoping it won't. I'm gonna go to her house and... I hope she's gonna show up, and we're gonna start our life together.",
        "Brooke: Do you think I need something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue?",
        "Katie: Really?",
        "Brooke: Yeah. No. I was just kidding. [Laughs]",
        "Katie: [Chuckles] So, you still haven't answered me.",
        "Brooke: Oh. Uh, well, you know, I'm just gonna focus on getting married today. That's what I'm doing.",
        "Katie: Right, but, uh... who are you marrying? I mean, you said you saw ridge earlier. I'm sure he gave you one last passionate plea. That change things? You're gonna put that dress on. Are you gonna marry ridge or Bill?",
        "Ivy: So, I'm thinking, if we take out these links here, we can put some jewels in, and it'll kind of just, you know, create a feature of the whole piece. Quinn, what are you doing? Hey, it's -- it's Quinn. Look, um, I know about today. About the wedding, um, to Brooke. Has the ceremony started yet?",
        "Bill: What's it to you?",
        "Quinn: All right, I'm gonna take that as, \"no, it hasn't.\"",
        "Bill: All right, look, Quinn, if you're trying to wrangle a last-minute invitation, you can forget it.",
        "Quinn: Oh, come on, Bill. I know we're not besties.",
        "Bill: Right. So, bye.",
        "Quinn: No! I also know how committed you are to Brooke. You love her. You've proven that over and over again.",
        "Bill: Thanks? You know, I have proven it over and over, and... and, Forrester, he's done nothing but let her down. Like, uh, in Australia. I don't know what he did, but it must have been a doozy for Brooke to cut him loose. You wouldn't know anything about that, would you, Quinn?",
        "Quinn: No, why would I?",
        "Bill: Well, because you're Eric's wife, ridge is his son. I thought maybe he confided in the old man and, in turn, Eric confided in you.",
        "Quinn: Nope. That did not happen. Eric knows as much about it as you do.",
        "Bill: Whatever ridge did to hurt Brooke, I intend to find out what it is. And when I do...",
        "Quinn: Shouldn't you just be focusing on making her Mrs. Bill Spencer? I mean, it's not a done deal until the minister proclaims you husband and wife, and... well, with -- with ridge putting on the full-court press...",
        "Bill: What?",
        "Quinn: He was with your fianc\u00e9e earlier, um, and, uh... I know that he's not giving up.",
        "Bill: Why would you be telling me this, Quinn?",
        "Quinn: Because I know how much you and Brooke have overcome to be together. Just like me and Eric have. And... if ridge is gonna play on their history and bring up their family to create any last-minute doubts, I --",
        "Bill: Forrester can pull all the crap he wants. It's not gonna change a thing. Are they together now?",
        "Quinn: No.",
        "Bill: No. Exactly. Brooke knows who she wants, and it's me, not him. This wedding is happening, and there's not a damn thing Forrester can do to stop it.",
        "Brooke: That was donna, just checking to see if the wedding was a go.",
        "Katie: How's dad?",
        "Brooke: Oh, he's -- he's much better. He's come to rely on her, so she's gonna stick around in Dallas for a while.",
        "Katie: Or she just doesn't want to be in the middle of things, like she was last time, you know, with ridge upstairs with you, convincing you to not marry Bill, and Bill downstairs with donna wondering where the heck you are...",
        "Brooke: That is not going to happen today.",
        "Katie: Why, because you're marrying Bill, or because you've already told Bill that you're marrying ridge, and you're going to go start your life with him? Listen, it's -- it's your life, and I will support you no matter what you decide. And I know that you're still angry at ridge for what happened in Australia with Quinn, but I got to tell you, I've been working really closely with her, and I see no evidence that anything is going on between ridge and Quinn. All I see is her devotion to Eric. Ridge loves you, and... I know you love him. You have a family with him. I know that R.J. Was a big reason why you didn't marry Bill in the first place. You're about to put on that dress. So what are you gonna do?",
        "Ivy: Quinn, look, I know that you didn't want me to hear the conversation between you and Bill, but, um... it was kind of hard not to. Do you really think Brooke might choose ridge after all?",
        "Quinn: I honestly don't know.",
        "Ivy: Would you care if she did? Well, I mean, why would you, right? I mean, you are happily married to Eric.",
        "Quinn: Yes, I am.",
        "Ivy: And anything that happened between you and ridge, that's completely over now. Even if it did potentially cost ridge his marriage with Brooke, but... you know, she might have changed her mind. Do you think he got through to her?",
        "Quinn: Can we not do this? We have a lot of work to do.",
        "Ivy: Sorry. I'll, um... I'm gonna go get those supplies that we need.",
        "Wyatt: Well, I don't get it. Mom calls you about ridge's full-court press on Brooke when she couldn't even care about you or your personal life. I mean, I don't understand that.",
        "Liam: Maybe she's just trying to stir up trouble.",
        "Wyatt: [Scoffs] Or it's what we all know -- she's changed. Maybe she was just giving you a courtesy heads up or something.",
        "Justin: Okay, Bill, look. You're not gonna go over there and get into it with Forrester.",
        "Bill: It's Brooke I'm thinking about, not that Forrester is. He just wants to trot out all that old tripe again, about how they share a history, how he's her destiny... well, it's bull. Brooke's destiny is with me. Brooke should be here by now.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Bill: Brooke.",
