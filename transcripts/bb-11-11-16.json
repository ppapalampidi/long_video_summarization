    "Recap": [
        "Quinn tells Wyatt and Ivy that she is trying to ingratiate herself into the family but they are all bailing on her. Steffy tells Ridge that the show stopper is spectacular. He says maybe but they will never see it today. He did not make it for Quinn's jewelry pass. But he tells Quinn that it will be a show to remember. Katie thanks Eric for inviting her to be his fashion show guest viewing partner. She brings a bottle of champagne and thanks him also for getting Will into the prep school. He tells Katie that Quinn is putting on a really great show. Maya rails into Sasha about her breaking up Nicole and Zende when she ran off to Hawaii and then ended up sleeping with Zende. They are arguing when Quinn comes by and says it is time for the jewelry pass they have never had on the runway before so they cannot be fighting. They must line up now. Charlie and Pam look smugly at each other; something is not quite right.",
        "Quinn is unhappy and says it will be okay though when they get to the show stopper. Ridge says wrong. He thinks too much of that dress to parade it before all of them after the jewelry pass. Quinn begs Steffy just to put the show stopper gown on. It was made for her and Eric is watching and expecting it. The show was never meant to stop with the jewelry line. She panics and asks Ivy but she says she is too tall. It was fitted for Steffy. Wyatt walks up and asks Steffy to put it on. Ridge says oh the cavalry is here. That was a disaster out there and he has to think of long term and his dress is not going out there. While all look on in amazement Ivy announces the show stopper and Ridge is shocked that Quinn is wearing his lovely wedding gown. It's a big hit. Ivy even announces the designer Ridge Forrester but he says he will not go out there. They tell him that he has to so he finally does and Quinn takes his hand and holds it up in triumph. He smiles but says he hates her; he hates everything about her."

        "Katie: [Laughing] Okay.",
        "Quinn: I'm trying to ingratiate myself into this family, but what I'm doing today, they all flat-out disagree.",
        "Ivy: The jewelry pass?",
        "Quinn: Yeah. Well, ridge thinks it's gonna be distracting and it's gonna hurt the flow of the show, none of which is true, but maybe -- maybe I-I shouldn't be doing this.",
        "Wyatt: What, mom? No. You have to believe in yourself, okay?",
        "Ivy: Exactly. Don't worry about what ridge things.",

        "Steffy: Dad, it's beautiful. And I know how proud of it you are.",
        "Ridge: I'm very proud of it. And I refuse for it to be a footnote to Quinn's jewelry pass.",
        "Quinn: Hey, everybody! All right! It is almost showtime, okay? So I just want to make sure that we are all on the same page, right? So, I'm gonna make the introductions, and then it's gonna be fashion pass, fashion pass, fashion pass, then jewelry pass, then showstopper -- amazing -- and then, ridge, you will come onto the runway at the very end for your well-deserved bow. Great, right?",

        "Sasha: You're serious? But we saw pictures.",
        "Zende: I guess Maya posted that before Nicole changed her mind. She tried to call me. She wanted to work things out.",
        "Sasha: I can't believe this.",
        "Zende: That's why she came to the jet. After seeing us in bed together, she's hurt, Sasha. She wants nothing to do with me.",

        "Quinn: All right, ladies. We are about to make Forrester history.",
        "Ivy: Sara, put this on your left.",
        "Quinn: Yes. That looks beautiful. Okay. There has never been a jewelry pass on the runway before, so I want you to remember the hair, the makeup, the wardrobe, the attitudes -- they're all backdrops for the jewelry and the accessories. Okay? So I want you to make Forrester proud. Line up and let's go. Go, go, go! Go!",
        "[Indistinct conversations]",
        "Ivy: I need to go prep the next dresses.",
        "Quinn: Okay. Okay. No, no, no, no. They look confused. Oh, god. That's bad.",
        "Ridge: I couldn't have said it better myself.",
        "Quinn: No. I wanted this to be a success for Eric. Okay. All right. Well, you know what? If they don't get it, then at least the buyers know what a showstopper is, and it's so beautiful, so -- so thank goodness we have that.",
        "Ridge: We kind of don't.",
        "Quinn: What?!",
        "Ridge: I'm really proud of that dress, and I don't want to put it out there after your failed little, uh, jewelry parade, so we're done here. Show's over.",
        "Quinn: You can't. Ridge, you can't! You can't be serious! We need to have the showstopper!",
        "Katie: Wow! I like this! Showcasing the jewelry?",
        "Eric: So, you get that concept, right?",
        "Katie: It's one of your most profitable lines. It's brilliant. I've never really seen anything like it.",
        "Quinn: We need the showstopper.",
        "Ridge: It seems to me that your jewelry pass has stopped the show. If only somebody'd told you what a bad idea that was.",
        "Quinn: Steffy, please. Please, you -- you have to put the gown on. Your grandfather is watching this from home. The show was never supposed to end with the jewelry pass. That was never my intention. It's gonna be a dud. This is your family. This is your company. Don't you want the show to be a success?",
        "Steffy: Of course I do.",
        "Quinn: Well, the last time you listened to ridge, it was a disaster, so, please, just put the gown on!",
        "Ridge: We can't endorse this.",
        "Quinn: Steffy, please. There isn't much time. You have to get ready.",
        "Steffy: I'm sorry, Quinn. I-I can't.",
        "Quinn: But, Steffy, please. It was fit for you, Steffy! Ohh. What am I gonna do? What am I -- you did great. You did great. You did great. You're beautiful.",
        "Ivy: Hey!",
        "Quinn: Hi.",
        "Ivy: It wasn't that bad!",
        "Quinn: I mean, some people are afraid of change, but you thought out of the box. I thought that that was great!",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. I mean, at least we'll get some press out of it. Where's Steffy in the showstopper?",
        "Quinn: There isn't gonna be showstopper.",
        "Ivy: What?!",
        "Wyatt: What -- what do you mean?",
        "Quinn: Ridge pulled it. And Steffy refused to wear it. He didn't want it following the catastrophe of the jewelry pass. He said it's gonna taint the show.",
        "Wyatt: Even if the jewelry gets well received, we can't end the show on that.",
        "Quinn: I know that. I know. [Gasps] Ivy, can you wear the gown?",
        "Ivy: Me? No. No. I'm too tall. All the models are too tall. It was fit for Steffy. I mean, what are we gonna do?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, Mom. What are we gonna do?",
        "Rick: I'm gonna go check on it -- make sure everything's okay.",
        "Brooke: Wait. They must have a plan.",
        "Charlie: No chatter.",
        "Pam: Seems longer than usual.",
        "Katie: So, is that it?",
        "Eric: No. We still have ridge's showstopper.",
        "Wyatt: Put it on.",
        "Ridge: Oh, the cavalry is here.",
        "Wyatt: Please put it on, Steffy. The runway is empty right now.",
        "Ridge: Empty? I saw all kinds of jewelry out there before.",
        "Wyatt: Are you this petty? You know, you say you love this company, that you're protecting it from my mother, but how is this protecting the company?! You're making this personal.",
        "Ridge: Hey, Corleone, calm down. I got to think long-term. That was a disaster out there, and I will not have my designs associated with it.",
        "Steffy: Maybe I should just put on the showstopper.",
        "Ridge: Steffy. Steffy.",
        "Steffy: Dad, don't --",
        "Ridge: No.",
        "Simone: What about the showstopper?",
        "Rick: Hey, hey. Excuse me. Excuse me. The show's not over.",
        "Brooke: No. They're just building the anticipation.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, no. I forgot to tell Jake you pulled the showstopper.",
        "Ivy: Ladies and gentlemen, Forrester creations is proud to present... our showstopper.",
        "Steffy: This is a disaster.",
        "Steffy: [Scoffs]",

        "Steffy: [Gasps]",
        "Eric: Quinn?",
        "Katie: Oh...my.",
