        "Wyatt tells Liam that his mother would never hurt Hope; she adores her. Liam says that is only when she is with Wyatt. With him it is a different story. Wyatt says his mother was angry. Liam brings out the worst in her. Hope begs Wyatt to do something. He has to get her some help. Liam says only Wyatt knows what she might be capable of. Wyatt can't believe they are serious but they say he has to confront his mom to find out for sure where her head is. Wyatt keeps saying she may be acting crazy but she is not a killer. He'll be the judge of that. He will talk to her and she will listen to him. And if it comes to it that he will call the police on her himself. He still thinks they are making way too big a deal with this so he wants to handle it. Meantime dial it back a little and stay away from her and don't flaunt their relationship. He says he is sorry. He never meant to put them in this position. Hope says they know it is not his fault. As he is leaving, Wyatt says he told her over and over to leave them alone but he will lay down the law and take her to task and she will listen. She will not be a danger to them. Brooke tells Deacon that he needs to go. Deacon says he knows Brooke does not trust him, but cut him some slack. He needs to be with his daughter and he owes her that much. Brooks asks him not to do this to her again. He says this isn't all about Brooke. He gets that she is with Spencer now. Bill starts down the stairs and sees Deacon and asks what is he doing here. Deacon smarts is that any way to treat an old war buddy. Bill asks Brooke if Deacon broke in. Deacon says he is not here to start anything. He is here about his daughter who is involved with Bill's son. Bill tells him to stay out of it. Bill gruffly says he is not here for his daughter. He's working some angle so what is it, money? Deacon says again he is there to support his daughter unless Bill has a problem with that. Bill says he has a problem with Deacon being around anybody that he cares about. Brooke says their daughter is happy and secure now and she does not need Deacon in her life so stay away from her and from Brooke too. Bill says Deacon heard her so beat it, convict. Brooke tells Bill that she has seen a little change in Deacon, nothing major as he is still a con artist. Bill says the change is part of the con. She reminds him that he had a big part in the Italy scene too. He says he has regretted that and said it over and over. He regrets getting involved with Sharpe. Brooke better listen to him as Deacon is a cancer and needs to be cut out of their lives for Hope's sake. Brooke tells Bill that Deacon is not in her life, but if her daughter wants a relationship with her father, then she has to trust her.",
        "Deacon returns to Quinn's as she is working on the piece actually it is finished, she just keeps taking it out and polishing it. Deacon wants to see what she has been working on. She asks how his day was. He says he went to see Brooke. She quips that must have been uncomfortable for Brooke. He says she wants nothing to do with him, and Bill was there. Quinn says that must have been unpleasant for Deacon then. He says he is all about Hope as he is her father, but enough about that. He wants to see the piece she has been working on; they are roomies, no secrets. She says they had an arrangement and he sort of bailed on that. He reminds her he is still on the job. She says a lot of good it did as Hope and Liam are tighter than ever. It looks like she will have to handle it herself. She holds up the sword. He says damn, it's beautiful and she made it? She retorts that it is a very special assignment. He says somebody must be paying her a bundle, this thing is killer. Quinn says that's the point. And it has an edge. He asks if she is going to hang it on the wall. But it's more than art. She could do some serious damage with that. He can't get her to say who she made it for, but he's a lucky guy. He knows it's a guy as it is not the sort of thing a housewife would use in the kitchen. She wraps it up neatly and says she has to go. She's keeping a promise to someone. He tells her to stay out of trouble. Bill tells Brooke they are not going to let that loser ruin their 4th of July. They can go out and watch some fireworks or start their own indoors. Liam asks Hope if she'd like to go out and watch the fireworks. She says he is limping too much and needs to sit down and she will just go for now. He has to be exhausted so just get some sleep. Wyatt comes back to the factory and only finds Deacon. He is surprised that he already knows his mother. Deacon says they met in a bar but it's not like what he thinks. She was nice enough to give him a roof over his head for a while. Wyatt wants to know what he really thinks of her and Deacon says she is a real piece of work. Wyatt offers him a drink as he has a ton of questions for him. Deacon says he can't, but he is worried about Quinn. Something is going on and he's worried about her. She went out but not alone .not a who but a what. He points to Wyatt's necklace, it was just like that. But it was not a piece of jewelry. It's the real deal, deadly, sharp as hell. And she said she had to keep a promise to someone. Wyatt says no, and brushes past Deacon to go. Hope comes home and Brooke says Deacon had been by wanting her to support him with Hope. Hope says she knows the two of them have issues but he asked for her forgiveness and she gave it to him. She motions to Bill just like Liam forgave him for all Bill did in Italy. Deacon is her dad and she'd really like to believe him when he says he loves her and wants to be part of her life. She is giving him that chance and it would mean a lot if they would too. Liam is checking all the windows and doors and locking up when Quinn comes blustering in. Liam yells at her to get out. She says she will shortly. He wants to know what she wants. She says she asked him over and over to be gone but he hasn't listened. And now he's even gone and told Wyatt and Hope. He says she is damn right and next he is going to tell the police. She says no that she doesn't think so. It's Independence Day and after today Hope and Wyatt will be free of him at last. He's about five inches from her face and says she is insane. She says he drove her to it. He tries to control Hope and her family; he's a coward who can't compete with Wyatt so he lies and lies some more. She looks at his foot and mocks that if it hurts .then kicks him in it and he falls to a quivering mass on the floor. She tells him not to worry. It will all be over soon. She pulls out the sword and holds it in front of his face. She says this is the Spencer sword .the one that he is not manly enough or worthy to wear. As he is shivering, she holds it to his throat and says she warned him but he did not listen. Now he's going to pay the price .live by the sword, die by the sword."

        "Brooke: Hope does not need to spend time with you.",
        "Deacon: Did she tell you that? Brooke, she wants me in her life. She needs her father, especially with everything that's going on with Ridge. 'Cause guess what? I'm all she's got.",
        "Brooke: Don't do this to me. Not again.",
        "Deacon: Brooke, this isn't about you. Look, I-I get it, all right? You know, you hooked up with Spencer. I'm not -- not gonna get in the way. But I do have to ask. Really? Spencer?",
        "Brooke: All right, that's it. Get out. Get out.",
        "Deacon: I'm not judging you. I mean, just a little bit.",
        "Bill: What the hell are you doing here? What do you want, Sharpe?",
        "Deacon: [Laughs] Come on. That's no way to greet an old war buddy.",
        "Bill: Did he break in?",
        "Deacon: Look, I'm not here to cause problems, all right? I'm here about my daughter, who happens to be involved with your son.",
        "Bill: Stay out of it.",
        "Deacon: Oh, what? Like you have? Right.",
        "Bill: You're not here for your daughter. You're here working an angle, like usual. So what is it? Money?",
        "Deacon: I'm here to support hope. Now, do you have a problem with that?",
        "Bill: I have a problem with you being anywhere near me or Brooke or hope or anyone else I care about.",
        "Deacon: She's my daughter, all right? You have kids! You know! You have to protect them! Do you feel the same way he does?",
        "Brooke: My daughter --",
        "Deacon: Our daughter.",
        "Brooke: Our daughter is with Liam now. She's very happy, and she's very secure. She doesn't need you in her life, deacon, so just stay away from her. Stay away from me.",
        "Bill: You heard the lady. Beat it, convict.",
        "Deacon: Okay.",
        "Hope: Here. Here. Look, Wyatt, you are the only one who can stop her.",
        "Wyatt: Yes, my mother can get crazy, but this? Come on.",
        "Liam: You have to at least confront her.",
        "Wyatt: How do you accuse your mother of threatening to kill your brother and the woman that you love?! How am I supposed to do that?! Look, are you sure that she wasn't just blowing off steam?",
        "Liam: Yes.",
        "Wyatt: How can you be so sure? You've seen her go off before, and so have I!",
        "Liam: Not like this.",
        "Hope: Wyatt, I'm sorry. If there was any way that -- that we could help you out of this, to avoid this, then we would. But she's got to be held accountable for the things that she says! Did she mean it? Was she serious?",

        "Quinn: Aww.",
        "[Cell phone chimes]",
        "Quinn: He told them. That pathetic, little worm told hope and my son.",
        "Bill: Well, he sure is playing the daughter card.",
        "Brooke: I want to believe deacon truly does care about hope.",
        "Bill: That loser cares about one thing and one thing only.",
        "Brooke: I do see a change in him.",
        "Bill: Brooke, come on!",
        "Brooke: Nothing major. He's still a con artist.",
        "Bill: The change is part of the con!",
        "Brooke: Don't say that to hope. She really wants to believe in her father.",
        "Bill: What about everything that happened in Italy?! Or has she just shifted all that blame to me?",
        "Brooke: You were a very big part of that.",
        "Bill: And I regret that, and I've said it over and over again, almost as much as I regret getting involved with Sharpe. Listen to me. He is a cancer, and you better cut him out of your life for hope's sake.",
        "Brooke: He's not in my life. But he may be in hope's. She's an adult. She wants a relationship with her father.",
        "Bill: He is taking her for a ride. Tell me you see that.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] I have to trust hope.",
        "Bill: She can't be objective, Brooke.",
        "Brooke: I'm there for her, and she knows it. So help me, if he does anything to hurt her...",
        "Bill: He's not going to do anything...to either one of you, because I'm here, and I'll protect you. Can't help wondering where he's staying. And who he's hooked up with.",
        "Brooke: And what it has to do with my daughter.",
        "Wyatt: Well, I don't buy it. My mother can be -- [Whistles] But she's not -- she's not a killer.",
        "Liam: Not yet.",
        "Wyatt: She flew off the handle. That happens.",
        "Hope: Wyatt, this is a lot more serious.",

        "Liam: What? Insane?",
        "Wyatt: Yes.",
        "Liam: Crazy?",
        "Wyatt: Yes!",
        "Liam: Somebody in their right mind does not threaten murder, and she's not, Wyatt!",
        "Wyatt: Okay, well, let me be the judge of that, all right?!",
        "Liam: Forgive me, dude, but I think she's past the point of being lectured.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, she'll listen to me.",
        "Hope: Well, what are you gonna say to her?",
        "Wyatt: Look, just... if she comes near either one of you, I will call the police, okay?",
        "Hope: What if that backfires? I mean, you mean everything to her.",
        "Wyatt: [Sighs] You guys are making way too big of a deal about this. Let me handle this. Please.",
        "Liam: [Scoffs] Okay, but in the meantime, what?",
        "Wyatt: Just dial it back a little. Stay away from her. Don't flaunt your relationship.",
        "Liam: Don't -- you think I haven't thought of that? She wants me out of town! She wants her job back!",
        "Hope: And that is not going to happen.",
        "Liam: Okay, listen, tell her this. Tell her -- tell her I threatened a restraining order.",
        "Wyatt: No, don't -- don't do that.",
        "Liam: She's threatened me twice, Wyatt. I can handle that. But now she's threatening hope. We can't stand for that.",
        "Wyatt: I-I'm so sorry about this. I never wanted to put you guys in this position.",
        "Hope: Wyatt, this isn't your fault.",
        "Wyatt: I told her over and over again, stay away from you guys. But I'll lay down the law. She won't be a problem anymore, okay? She flew off the handle, but I will take her to task. She won't be a danger for you. Either one of you. I'm so sorry about this.",

        "Deacon: Hey. You're still at it, huh?",
        "Quinn: I'm finished.",
        "Deacon: Really? Well, let me see it. Whatever it is.",
        "[Fireworks explode]",
        "Quinn: How was your day?",
        "Deacon: Ah. Okay, dear. Um, well, I went to go see Brooke.",
        "Quinn: Oh, well, that must have been unpleasant for her.",
        "Deacon: Yeah, well, she wants nothing to do with me.",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles] And this surprises you?",
        "Deacon: So, Bill was there, too.",
        "Quinn: Ooh, that must have been unpleasant for you.",
        "Deacon: You know, all I want is to be there for hope, all right? I'm her father, too. Enough about that. It just -- show me this thing that you've been working on. Is this it? Oh, come on! Roomies -- no secrets.",
        "Quinn: You know, we had an arrangement, and you kind of bailed on your end of it.",
        "Deacon: I'm still on the job.",
        "Quinn: Yeah? A lot of good it's done. Hope and Liam are closer than ever.",
        "Deacon: Okay.",
        "Quinn: I'm going to have to handle it myself.",
        "Deacon: Enough about that. Just show me what this thing is, all right? Wait, stop. Before you do, let me guess. It's a diamond-studded leash for your son. Whoa.",
        "Quinn: What do you think?",
        "Deacon: Damn. The thing is beautiful. You made that?",
        "Quinn: It's a very special assignment.",
        "Deacon: [Scoffs] Uh, somebody's paying you a bundle, because this thing is killer.",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles] That's the point.",
        "Bill: All right, listen to me. We're not going to let that loser ruin our independence day. Let's go outside, and we can watch some fireworks.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs]",
        "Bill: Or, better yet, we could set some off in here.",
        "Brooke: Hmm. [Chuckles] Yeah.",
        "Bill: Brooke... deacon is gone.",
        "Brooke: Yeah. I want to believe that. [Sighs] It's just that he's trouble. He always has been. And I don't want him to bring that back into hope's life.",
        "Quinn: Lovely, isn't it?",
        "Deacon: It's got an edge.",
        "Quinn: Of course. It's a sword.",
        "Deacon: You've done this before.",
        "Quinn: Hmm. Not this size.",
        "Deacon: It's -- it's a beautiful piece. What are you gonna do with it? Hang it on the wall?",
        "Quinn: We'll see.",
        "Deacon: I mean, it's more than just a piece of art. You could really do some damage with that thing.",
        "Quinn: Hmm.",
        "Deacon: Who'd you make it for?",
        "Quinn: Well, that's confidential.",
        "Deacon: [Chuckles] He's a lucky guy.",
        "Quinn: Who says it's a man?",
        "Deacon: It's not exactly the kind of thing that a housewife would use in the kitchen.",
        "Quinn: I have to go.",
        "Deacon: Where?",
        "Quinn: Out.",
        "Deacon: You gonna deliver the product?",
        "Quinn: I'm keeping a promise to someone.",
        "Deacon: You want some company?",
        "Quinn: Why would you want to tag along?",
        "Deacon: It's a valuable piece. Just thought you could use some protection.",
        "Quinn: You don't think I can protect myself?",
        "Deacon: Good point.",
        "Quinn: Later.",
        "Deacon: Quinn. Stay out of trouble.",
        "Liam: It's unreal, isn't it? W Quinn just went off like that? It's like -- it's like something in her snapped, you know. Just sent her into a different orbit.",
        "Hope: It's scary.",
        "Liam: Yeah. You know, hopefully Wyatt will take care of things.",
        "Hope: Yeah.",
        "Liam: So, do you want to, like, watch some fireworks?",
        "Hope: [Chuckles] You can barely walk. You're not going anywhere.",
        "Liam: Maybe we could go sit by the fire pit or...",
        "Hope: You're exhausted. Go get some sleep.",
        "Liam: You could probably use some rest, too, huh?",
        "Hope: Yeah. Good night, my love.",
        "Liam: Let me at least limp you to the door. [Clears throat]",
        "Wyatt: Mom?",
        "[Fireworks exploding]",
        "Deacon: Hey, kid.",
        "Wyatt: What are you -- where's my mother?",
        "Deacon: She, uh, she left.",
        "Wyatt: Huh. So, then you have met her.",
        "Deacon: I met your mother before I met you.",
        "Wyatt: And why didn't you say something?",
        "Deacon: Because I came to talk to you. I didn't come to talk about Quinn.",
        "Wyatt: Right. You were scoping out the other brother.",
        "Deacon: Mm-hmm.",
        "Wyatt: So, how did you and dear, old mom meet?",
        "Deacon: [Chuckles] We, uh, we met at a bar. It's not what you think. She was nice enough to give me a roof over my head.",
        "Wyatt: Huh. What'd you think of her?",
        "Deacon: Nice lady.",
        "Wyatt: No, deacon. Really.",
        "Deacon: Real piece of work.",
        "Wyatt: Right.",
        "Deacon: Yeah.",
        "Wyatt: So, you want a drink? 'Cause I got a ton of questions for you. Scotch, was it?",
        "Deacon: Yeah, no. I can't, Wyatt. Listen, something's going on with your mom. I'm worried about her.",
        "Brooke: You know what? We should call hope and Liam and see what they're doing for the fireworks. Oh, hope! I was just about to call you.",
        "Hope: It's amazing. You can see the fireworks right outside.",
        "Bill: Where's Liam?",
        "Hope: He is at home tucked in bed. It's been a rough day. Sprained ankle and all. It takes a toll. What's going on here?",
        "Brooke: Uh, your father stopped by.",
        "Hope: Oh, yeah? To see me?",
        "Brooke: No. To get my support.",
        "Hope: For what?",
        "Brooke: His relationship with you.",
        "Bill: And who knows what else.",
        "Hope: [Sighs] Look, I-I know that you guys both have your issues with him.",
        "Bill: You should, too, hope.",
        "Brooke: At least a healthy skepticism.",
        "Hope: Look, he asked for my forgiveness, and I decided to give it to him. Just like Liam forgave you for your part with everything that happened in Italy. He's my dad. And I'd really like to believe him when he says that he loves me and he wants to be a part of my life, so I'm -- I'm giving him that chance. It'd mean a lot if you could try, too.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs]",
        "Hope: I'm gonna go to bed, okay? I'll see you in the morning.",
        "Brooke: Good night, sweetie.",
        "Hope: Good night. Good night, Bill.",
        "Bill: Good night.",
        "[Fireworks exploding]",
        "Brooke: I don't like it. But I have to trust my daughter.",
        "Bill: She's a lot like her mom. Stubborn, beautiful.",
        "Brooke: [Chuckles]",
        "Bill: Very, very strong.",
        "Brooke: Happy independence day, Bill.",
        "Wyatt: You're worried about my mother?",
        "Deacon: Yeah, and I got a feeling you are, too.",
        "Wyatt: Where is she?",
        "Deacon: I don't know, but she, uh, she didn't go alone.",
        "Wyatt: Well, who was she with?",
        "Deacon: No, no, no, no. It's not a who. It's a what. She's been -- she's been working on this thing, and she took it with her.",
        "Wyatt: What is it?",
        "Deacon: It's exactly like this.",
        "Wyatt: What?",
        "Deacon: This sword around your neck! She made something just like that, but it wasn't a piece of jewelry! It's the real deal! It's sharp as hell! Deadly!",
        "Wyatt: And she took it with her?!",
        "Deacon: She said something about having to keep a promise to someone.",
        "Wyatt: No, no, no. No, I got to go.",
        "Deacon: Wyatt!",
        "Liam: Get out! Get out!",
        "Quinn: Oh, I'll be leaving shortly.",
        "Liam: I'm sick of this! What do you want, Quinn?!",
        "Quinn: Haven't I asked you over and over? I want you gone! But you haven't listened!",
        "Liam: [Sighs]",
        "Quinn: And now you've gone and told hope and Wyatt.",
        "Liam: What? About your threats? Are you kidding me? You're damn right I did! And I'm gonna tell the police next! What do you think of that?",
        "Quinn: No, I don't think so. It's dependence day, Liam. And after tonight, hope and Wyatt will be free of you at last.",
        "Liam: You are insane.",
        "Quinn: You drove me to it. Your control over hope and her family. You're a coward!",
        "Liam: [Scoffs]",
        "Quinn: You -- you can't compete with Wyatt, so you lie and you lie. Well, not anymore. Does your ankle hurt?",
        "Liam: Oh! Oh!",
        "Quinn: Don't you worry. It'll all be over soon.",
        "Liam: [Gasping]",
        "Quinn: Oh, do you see this, Liam? Yeah. This -- this is the Spencer sword.",
        "Liam: Wait.",
        "Quinn: The one that you are not man or worthy enough to wear.",
        "Liam: Wait, wait, wait!",
        "Quinn: I warned you, and you didn't listen, so now you get to pay the price. Live by the sword... die by the sword."
