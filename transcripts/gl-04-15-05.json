        "Dinah arranges a meeting between Blake, Ross, Cassie, Edmund, and her. She tells them that she is pregnant with Cassie and Edmund's child. Ross and Blake are shocked, as well as Tammy, who overhears the news when she walks in. Ross becomes upset with Edmund's carelessness with Dinah's feelings. Blake tries to comfort Cassie by reminding her that abortion is still an option. Gus tries to relate to Olivia, but only ends up offending her with his friendliness. Harley attempts to make \"girl talk\" with her roommate, but she is promptly ignored. Mallet reveals that he is the new warden, and he and Harley fight about their past. Harley says that she hates him for cheating on her and that he is the reason she is in prison today. Edmund asks Cassie to spend the night with him, but she refuses. He walks into their suite expecting to find her in bed waiting for him, but he finds a naked Dinah instead. Jeffrey asks Cassie to go somewhere with him. Tony wants to elope with Michelle the very next day. He reschedules the divorce hearing for that very day without either Danny or Michelle's consent. Gus hires someone to investigate the strange note he found under his door. Next, he begins to theorize that Olivia might be Phillip's real murderer."

        "Gus: That's something.",
        "Olivia: ( Scoffs ) it's something i'd like to forget.",

        "Ross: Oh, now, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Cassie, what is going on? Dinah is carrying your child?",
        "Tammy: Oh, my god.",
        "Edmund: Tammy, wait. We can explain this.",
        "Cassie: No, no. I'll explain it to her.",
        "Tammy: Are you kidding me? There's no explaining this.",
        "Dinah: I know this is big news for you...",

        "Tammy: But dinah, of all people. That's disgusting.",
        "Cassie: I know, i know. But you know what? It is what it is. And we were just at cedars and we saw the baby on a sonogram, so...",
        "Tammy: You know, you can't trust her.",
        "Cassie: I know.",
        "Tammy: She is so going to double-cross you. She's going to hurt you with your own baby, mom, I just know it.",
        "Edmund: Tammy, tammy, i am not going to let that happen. I promise.",
        "Tammy: Don't talk to me. This would never have happened if it weren't for you. How could you do this to my mom?",
        "Dinah: I'm doing a good deed, daddy.",
        "Ross: Oh, dinah.",
        "Dinah: Stop. I am helping someone have a baby. How could that possibly be bad?",

        "Dinah: Where's bill? He was supposed to be here. I need the support of my brother.",
        "Ross: I don't think he'll be all that enthusiastic about this, so don't get your hopes up.",
        "Dinah: Daddy, come here. Come on. Be happy for me. I am finally becoming the person you've always wanted me to be.",
        "Blake: How's tammy?",
        "Cassie: Upset. She took off. Like that kid hasn't been through enough.",
        "Blake: Life. This is almost as bad as thinking two different guys fathered your twins.",
        "Cassie: I cannot believe edmund did this.",
        "Blake: He is acting pretty desperate. He reminds me of my father.",
        "Cassie: Oh. Great. There's nothing I can do about it.",
        "Blake: There might be.",
        "Michelle: See, now that mommy remembers a lot more, I'm going to be a lot more fun. You'll see.",

        "Tony: What are you going to do?",
        "Gus: It's getting awful chilly in here.",
        "Olivia: What did you expect to happen, gus? You'd waltz intere, we'd have a couple of drinks and become the best of friends?",
        "Gus: No, I just thought it would be good to have an ally in the old big spaulding mansion.",
        "Olivia: You don't want allies, you want suspects. You're on your one-man quest to save harley.",
        "Gus: I told you, she is in jail.",
        "Olivia: You know what? I can read between the lines. You're just feeling guilty.",
        "Gus: Guilty? Look, am i feeling bad she's in jail? Yes. Did I want her there? Of course not. I'm off the case, though. It is over between us.",
        "Olivia: Stop it. I'm not buying your act.",
        "Gus: I'm not acting. What are you talking about? I'm trying to move on with my life, here. Why do you think i moved back into the house in the first place?",
        "Olivia: I don't know, gus. You tell me.",
        "Gus: Didn't i just tell you?",
        "Olivia: Don't. I will not be your scapegoat.",
        "Gus: Hey, what are you, just feeling guilty that you ruined her life, huh? And you drove your husband into her bed? Is that your problem?",
        "Olivia: You know what? Just leave me alone! Leave me alone!",
        "Bill: Working on a new acquisition?",
        "Harley: You're the warden?",
        "Mallet: Haven't been here much longer than you.",
        "Harley: This isn't happening. Somebody wake me up.",
        "Mallet: You're not dreaming.",
        "Harley: I'm having a nightmare. This is a nightmare.",
        "Mallet: So, i take it you're not happy to see me? Can't say I'm surprised.",
        "Harley: Ten years.",
        "Mallet: I think it's only been eight or nine.",
        "Harley: Ten years and you... You end up here? I mean, what is worse than being in prison? Being in prison with your ex- husband who cheated on you.",
        "Mallet: God, cooper, nobody can hold a grudge like you.",
        "Harley: A grudge? A grudge? A grudge?",
        "Mallet: What do you want me to say? That i'm sorry? I can't change what happened.",
        "Harley: Well, if you came here looking for sympathy, you are in the wrong place. There couldn't be a wronger place in the world!",
        "Mallet: You know what? This isn't how i pictured it.",
        "Harley: What?",
        "Mallet: Seeing you again. In all the times i thought about it, this was never how it went.",
        "Harley: Really? Because this is exactly how i pictured it. I figured you'd come visit me in prison, you'd flash me that smile, sure I'd forgive you, and the next thing you know, it's lockdown.",
        "Mallet: It's really good to see you. You look good, considering. What? What? I just wanted to see you. I wanted to see how you're getting along.",
        "Harley: I'm in prison. It pretty much sucks. But hey, i look good. I guess that's all that matters, right?",
        "Mallet: I shouldn't have... Okay, I guess we have to keep this professional.",
        "Harley: Professional? I'm a prisoner. This isn't a job for me. This is my life.",
        "Mallet: That's not what i meant.",
        "Harley: I don't care what you meant.",
        "Mallet: I should get out of here.",
        "Harley: I hate you. I wouldn't even be in here if it wasn't for you. Coming up on \"guiding light\"...",
        "Cassie: I need a little distance.",
        "Jeffrey: Do you mean that?",
        "Cassie: Yeah, i do.",
        "Jeffrey: Then come with me.",
        "Harley: I can't think about what i lost when you slept with some chick in your surveillance van ten years ago, okay? I'm too busy thinking about what i've lost now, in the present.",
        "Mallet: So it's my fault you got sent up for murder?",
        "Harley: I wouldn't have been with phillip spaulding if you hadn't cheated on me, or anybody else, for that matter. My whole life would be different.",
        "Mallet: Yeah. You wouldn't have had kids.",
        "Harley: We would have. Somehow.",
        "Mallet: Probably not. So you're telling me you would have traded your boys to keep things status quo with me? You would go back and change everything?",
        "Harley: If it meant not ending up here? No. Of course not. I still hate you.",
        "Mallet: You should. What i did was just rotten.",
        "Harley: You have no idea.",
        "Mallet: What happened to get you in here, cooper?",
        "Harley: Are you asking me if i killed phillip?",
        "Mallet: ( Sighs )",
        "harley: What do you think?",
        "Mallet: I don't know. I've seen you angry enough, like that time with your dad.",
        "Harley: I was hurt.",
        "Mallet: And you wanted to hurt him.",
        "Harley: I wouldn't have killed him.",
        "Mallet: So, phillip took your kids. Huh? I mean, it's understandable if that...",
        "Harley: I didn't kill phillip, okay? Did I think about it?K hell, yeah. Hell, yeah. You know, I've only felt that way one other time in my life. Any guesses when?",
        "Bill: What do you want?",
        "Gus: I don't really know. I just went a couple of rounds with your wife. I think maybe I'm a glutton for punishment.",
        "Bill: Yeah, i guess you are.",
        "Gus: But she is special, isn't she? A special lady. I'm surprised that you lasted as long as you did.",
        "Bill: You know, trashing olivia is not going to make us good buddies. We loved each other.",
        "Gus: Oh, you loved each other? See, because i thought it was, like, an arrangement of some sort.",
        "Bill: Well, at first maybe it was.",
        "Gus: Doesn't really matter, though, as long as you parted ways, with my girl.",
        "Bill: Oh, my goodness. Harley had her reasons for doing what she did.",
        "Gus: And you, bill, are completely innocent in the whole thing, right?",
        "Bill: You know what? I came here to unwind, so if you don't mind, I don't need this right now.",
        "Gus: But I... I don't need it.",
        "Bill: Gus? Olivia... How did... How did she seem?",
        "Gus: Well, besides being her wonderful, charming self, I'd say paranoid.",
        "Bill: Well, cut her some slack. She's had a tough time of it.",
        "Gus: No more than anybody else.",
        "Bill: Well, you know what phillip did to her.",
        "Gus: Phillip was not a nice person. I guess it runs in the family.",
        "Gus: Oh, that i've heard. Yeah.",
        "Bill: Look, olivia ght seem tough, but things get to her, and phillip, he got to her.",
        "Gus: He got to a lot of people, bill.",
        "Bill: No, i mean he really got to her. She was having nightmares about the guy.",
        "Tony: What? What's wrong, danny? You don't seem too happy.",
        "Danny: Don't push me, tony.",
        "Tony: Oh, come on. What, your divorce is going to go through, but what? You can't get on with your life?",
        "Danny: Yeah. My life. Rescheduling my divorce hearing isn't your business.",
        "Tony: Oh, there you go again, forgetting about michelle. This is your thing, man.",
        "Danny: Oh. Oh, did michelle ask you to do this?",
        "Tony: No, she didn't, but we got a wedding to plan, all right? How long am I supposed to sit around and wait for you to handle your end, huh?",
        "Danny: She just got her memory back.",
        "Tony: It doesn't change anything, danny.",
        "Danny: Yeah? Then why do you seem so nervous?",
        "Michelle: What's going on?",
        "Danny: We're just talking about the divorce.",
        "Michelle: Is that it?",
        "Danny: That's it.",
        "Tony: Babe, i think we should go.",
        "Michelle: Where?",
        "Tony: You got another document to sign before... Before tomorrow.",
        "Michelle: Yeah, but i told robbie...",
        "Tony: It's got to be done by 5:00 or else the hearing cannot happen, okay?",
        "Danny: Do you need my signature?",
        "Tony: No, just michelle's.",
        "Michelle: All right, let me go say goodbye to robbie.",
        "Tony: Babe, listen to me. There's not enough time. Let's just go.",
        "Michelle: There's time, okay? Robbie?",
        "Blake: Dinah's pregnancy, i mean it is early on. You do have choices.Y6\u00d1",
        "cassie: Blake.",
        "Blake: No, I'm sorry. I'm not trying to tell you anything to do. I mean, that is not my job to tell you anything. I'm just... If you don't trust dinah, if you have a problem with this, it's just that it's still early on.\u00e7",
        "Cassie: I couldn't do that.",
        "Blake: It's just an option. For some people, it's an option.",
        "Cassie: I know.",
        "Blake: Oh, I'm sorry, honey. I'm so sorry. I don't want to make this worse for you.",

        "Edmund: Dinah? May I have a minute alone with your father?",
        "Dinah: I actually don't think that speaking...",
        "Ross: No, dinah, I would like to speak to edmund alone. Okay, go ahead. Convince me that you have not stuck a fuse into a walking time bomb.",
        "Edmund: Ross, your daughter is not a walking time bomb.",
        "Ross: And you apparently are not as astute as i thought.",
        "Edmund: She is doing this because she genuinely wants to change.",
        "Ross: This is not the way to go about it. Dinah is a very troubled young woman.",
        "Edmund: With the support of me and cassie.",
        "Ross: Your support? And what happens to dinah at the end of this pregnancy, when she gives birth and she sees the baby and holds the baby, and then has to give it up? Will you be there to pick up the pieces, you selfish, arrogant fool?",
        "Edmund: Be careful, mr. Mayor. Don't come between a man and his child.",
        "Dinah: It's okay. It's okay.",
        "Cassie: God, I wanted this baby so much.",

        "Blake: Honey, you guys have been thrown so many obstacles, it's amazing that you're still standing.",
        "Cassie: Barely standing.",
        "Blake: You're going to get through this, okay?",
        "Cassie: Yeah.",
        "Edmund: Cassie? I'm sorry. Did you speak with tammy?",

        "Edmund: Cassie, listen, i wouldn't... I wouldn't have done this if I didn't love you so much, and if i didn't know that you loved me, too.",
        "Cassie: I do love you.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, we saw our baby today for the very first time in the hospital. That... It was the most amazing experience of my life.",
        "Cassie: I know. I know.",
        "Edmund: I want to be with you tonight.",
        "Cassie: Oh, edmund, i don't know, okay? I don't know.",
        "Edmund: No, nothing will happen, cassie. Nothing will happen. We'll send dinah back to the farm and we'll just go upstairs. What do you think?",
        "Cassie: That would be nice.",
        "Edmund: So that's a yes?",
        "Cassie: You have to sleep in tammy's room, okay? You have to. I'm sorry.",

        "Jeffrey: Hm. So it's about the baby, not him.",
        "Cassie: I don't know.",
        "Jeffrey: You think you can trust him again, cassie? You think you can forgive him again? You know, maybe it doesn't matter as long as it's about the baby.",
        "Cassie: I don't know, jeffrey.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, you better figure something out real quick, because he's up there, waiting.",

        "( Sighs ) look, I know that I said that i would come up, but i'm just not ready to do that, and I'm sorry. I'll talk to you tomorrow. I feel bad leaving that on a message.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, then maybe you should go inside and tell him yourself.",
        "Cassie: No. No. I need a little distance.",

        "Gus: How is she now? I mean, is she still having these nightmares?",
