        "Liam tries to point out to Steffy what Quinn is doing \u0096 she is trying to get Steffy on her side. He reminds her that is exactly what will happen as she is dangling this carrot in front of Steffy to become CEO and using her grandfather to do it. Steffy argues that her grandfather would never do that if he did not believe she was ready to lead FC. Liam says he knows she is ready and the company would flourish but that is not why Quinn is pushing this. She says there were a lot of hurt feelings but this being CEO is a way of them getting past all of that again. Over and over Liam says Quinn is manipulating the situation and Steffy cannot let her do that. He does not want Quinn getting into her head. She replies that her grandfather is the most important thing to her and he still has confidence in her despite months now of being at odds. He points out again that her grandfather is asking her to accept Quinn and totally disregard all she has done in the past. And Quinn wants her back with her son. Steffy says that is not going to happen. Liam retorts they may know that but you could chisel that in stone and Quinn will not accept it. She argues again that her grandfather's offer was sincere and this matchmaker thing is not going to work. And she cannot turn this offer down especially if Quinn ends up running the company if she doesn't. He could have asked Rick or Ridge or even Thorne but his confidence has been shaken and he asked her so how can she turn that down? Quinn tells Eric and Wyatt that things are looking good and she hopes to see both Steffy and Wyatt running the company as husband and wife. Eric tells Wyatt that his mother does not want to compromise his marriage over her own. Ridge walks in and wants to see his dad alone. He starts off that he has good news \u0096 he and Brooke are back together. Eric thinks that is good news. Ridge says that signals a new beginning for him and Eric and for the family. He thinks he and Brooke should lead the way for FC into the future. Quinn makes Wyatt a sandwich and says she would love to be a fly on the wall right now if Eric is telling Ridge that he picked Steffy for CEO and watch Ridge's head implode. Eric tells Ridge that a husband and wife team is a good thing for the company. Stephanie was more than a wife to him, she was a good partner for the company, but she is gone now and he has Quinn. But she is about to step aside. She knows how important it is that a Forrester sit in that CEO chair. Eric has chosen someone he knows and loves and has forgiven for recent events. Ridge thinks of course he is speaking about him and thanks him. Eric says no, is it not Ridge. He has picked Steffy. Quinn tries to get close enough to hear through the walls and wants to hear the explosion when the Prodigal son gets passed over in favor of his own daughter. Eric tells Ridge that Steffy has everything she needs to lead this company into the future and Ridge cannot expect him to brush aside all the differences and disrespect he has had for him recently. It was all very hurtful. And Ridge should know it was Quinn who suggested this and he knows Steffy has the business savvy and will make a great CEO if she accepts it.",
        "Liam recounts to Steffy that he is not against her grandfather but he wants her to remember Quinn and all her crimes and manipulations she has maneuvered. This is the way she conned her way into Eric's life. And he is worried that Quinn will do that or even worse if she takes the position. She replies that she shares his concerns and reservations and that is why she has not said yes yet. She wants Quinn gone but if she turns this down it will only solidify her position in the company and her grandfather's life. If it were just Quinn offering she would say no but it is her grandfather who tells her she is just like Stephanie and this is a wonderful opportunity. Liam argues that he knows that but it all comes back to Quinn and how she operates so do not let her do this and draw Steffy in. Quinn tells Wyatt that she does not believe whatever Liam says will sway Steffy. Steffy tells Liam that her eyes are wide open and she knows Quinn has ulterior motives and this is no exception. Liam still cannot believe that Quinn is in total control of the company now and is willing to give that up without something in return. She is brokering for Steffy and Wyatt to get back together. Steffy says maybe but that is not why Eric is doing it. Liam says she cannot know what Eric wants as he is still recovering. Eric told her exactly what Quinn wanted him to. She programmed Eric to believe that Steffy was just what the company was waiting for. She's hurt. She just had the most special moment with her grandfather and Liam is now saying they were just words that Quinn put in his mouth. But she will not let him degrade that. He rails at her that yes she deserves the job but not like this. Do not take the job. Ridge tells Eric that his daughter will know it is his time and hers will come later. He gets it \u0096 he has hurt his dad and all he can do now is try to be a better son and a better CEO just as Eric has groomed him for all these years. Now he is ready. He would like the chance to prove it with Brooke at his side. He outright asks his dad to appoint him CEO."

        "Liam: You see what she's doing, right? You know how manipulative Quinn is being. She's trying to get you on her side.",
        "Steffy: [Scoffs] I'm not on Quinn's side.",
        "Liam: No, that's the point. You'll have to be if you accept the C.E.O. position, Steffy. She's dangling a very tempting carrot in front of you right now, and she's using your grandfather to do it.",
        "Steffy: My grandfather wouldn't go along with it if he didn't believe I was ready to lead Forrester.",
        "Liam: No. [Sighs] You are ready. You're smart and strong and savvy, and the company would absolutely flourish under your leadership, but that's not why Quinn is pushing this.",
        "Steffy: Look, I know that Quinn always has an agenda, but my grandfather hates everything that was going on between us. By offering me C.E.O., that's a way we can get past all of our hurt feelings, Liam.",
        "Liam: I don't -- I don't have a problem with that. What I have a problem with is Quinn. She is using your feelings for your grandfather and his for you in order to manipulate the situation, and you can't let her do that. You can't let that woman win one more time.",
        "Quinn: This could be a turning point for the company and for you and Steffy, as well.",
        "Wyatt: You realize she's already picturing it, right -- your granddaughter running Forrester creations with me by her side?",
        "Quinn: Oh, no, no, no -- not just running it but running it as husband and wife. Wouldn't that be great, sweetheart?",
        "Wyatt: Oh, you know what would be even more wonderful? If she started seeing you differently, that would be great.",
        "Quinn: Well, hopefully, she will, knowing that I suggested she take over as C.E.O. -- with Eric's support and preference, of course.",
        "Eric: Your mother is determined to make sure that her happiness is not at the expense of yours or your marriage's.",
        "Quinn: Well, and it has been up until now.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Ridge: I would like to speak to my dad alone, please.",
        "Quinn: Uh, all right. Well, we'll give you some space.",
        "Eric: All right.",
        "Quinn: Okay?",
        "Ridge: Hey.",
        "Eric: Ridge.",
        "Ridge: I've got some news. Brooke and I are back together.",
        "Eric: That's wonderful.",
        "Ridge: Thank you. And I feel that that signals a new beginning for us and... for our family.",
        "Wyatt: Are you -- are you out of sardines? Mom!",
        "Quinn: What?",
        "Wyatt: Well [Scoffs] I know that I ate earlier, but I'm still kind of hungry.",
        "Quinn: Okay. Well, fine, but...sardines? I hope you didn't make those fishy- smelling sandwiches when you were married to Steffy.",
        "Wyatt: Are you kidding me? She loves sardines more than I do. Okay, that was a lie. She hates them. But that was not what broke us up.",
        "Quinn: I know. I did. But with any luck and Eric's very generous offer... you know, he really does care about you. He really thinks of you as a son.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, well, speaking of sons, I wonder what Ridge is talking to Eric about.",
        "Quinn: I don't know, but if I had my guess, it would probably be about his never-ending quest to get me out of his father's life.",
        "Ridge: You're happy for me and Brooke, right?",
        "Eric: Of course. How could you think otherwise?",
        "Ridge: Just everything we've been going through, I wasn't sure.",
        "Eric: This has nothing to do with that. I've always been a big supporter of you and Brooke being together. R.J. Must be thrilled the two of you are back.",
        "Ridge: He is, but we can't get married soon enough, just to solidify our family, and I thought maybe we could do the same... for the whole family.",
        "Eric: In what way?",
        "Ridge: I think Brooke and I should lead this family, this company, into the future. What do you say?",
        "Liam: You know I'm just trying to protect you, right? I don't want Quinn getting inside your head.",
        "Steffy: She hasn't.",
        "Liam: But your grandfather has?",
        "Steffy: He is the most important thing to me. You know, to know that my grandfather still has confidence in me after months of estrangement, I --",
        "Liam: Yeah. Estra-- [Chuckles] Estrangement brought on by Quinn. She has hurt so many people, Steffy.",
        "Steffy: I-I know that. I know. But this is about my grandfather and the woman he knows me to be. I mean, I am like my namesake. Stephanie Forrester -- she was the epitome of leadership and strength, and most of all, she was a unifier. And that's exactly what my grandfather's asking me to be.",
        "Liam: You sure that's all he's asking? Like, he's not asking for you to accept Quinn... which entails a total -- a total -- disregard for all the damage she's done?",
        "Liam: I mean, you know I'm not disparaging your grandfather in any way, right?",
        "Steffy: I know.",
        "Liam: I'm just -- I'm just wondering... out loud if -- if him making you C.E.O. Isn't a way to dispose you to accepting his new wife -- that's all.",
        "Steffy: You know how I feel about Quinn.",
        "Liam: Yeah. Yes, I do, and I also know how Quinn feels about you and her son. She wants you back with Wyatt, Steffy.",
        "Steffy: You kno-- that's not gonna happen, Liam!",
        "Liam: Yeah. You know that and I know that. We know that. But you could chisel that into stone, and Quinn still wouldn't accept it.",
        "Steffy: I don't care about Quinn! I care about my grandfather and what he said. His offer -- he was sincere. And this whole matchmaker -- it's not gonna work. But the C.E.O. position -- how could I possibly turn that down, especially if Quinn ends up running the company permanently if I don't? My granddad -- he could have gone to my father, to Rick, to Thorne. But his trust has been shaken, and he's looking at me to restore it. How can I -- how can I not do this? He has faith in me. What kind of granddaughter would I be?",
        "Quinn: Extra-lean chicken, sun-dried tomatoes, pesto sauce. Hmm!",
        "Wyatt: Thanks.",
        "Quinn: I will have sardines put on the shopping list for you.",
        "Wyatt: Ah, thank you.",
        "Quinn: Maybe I should make a sandwich and bring it out to Ridge.",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles]",
        "Quinn: What? Do you know a better way to find out what they're talking about?",
        "Wyatt: Why not just eavesdrop like you usually do?",
        "Quinn: Maybe Eric is telling him about the offer to make Steffy C.E.O. right now. What I wouldn't give to be a fly on the wall -- watch Ridge's head just go [Imitates explosion] Combust!",
        "Eric: Ridge, there's no question that you and Brooke back together will be a good thing for the family and for the business, too. Strong leadership grounded in a couple -- that's a good thing.",
        "Ridge: Like you and Mom for all those years.",
        "Eric: Yes, and like Quinn and me now.",
        "Ridge: With all due respect, Dad, you and Quinn didn't build this company from the ground up. That was you and mom. There was nothing you couldn't accomplish together.",
        "Eric: Well, you're absolutely right about that. Your mother was much more than a wife to me. She was a partner in every sense of the word. But she is gone now. We have to look to the future.",
        "Ridge: Yes, and that's why I think Brooke and I should lead this family forward.",
        "Eric: But... only if Quinn steps aside, right? Well... she's about to.",
        "Ridge: Really?",
        "Eric: Quinn knows it's important that someone from the family be in the lead chair. She knows it should be a Forrester.",
        "Ridge: So, you're going back to work? Good for you.",
        "Eric: No. No, I'm not. But I've chosen someone -- someone I love... someone I love very much who betrayed me... and whom I've forgiven.",
        "Ridge: I can't even tell you what that means to me. You're giving me a chance to regain your trust and to run this company. Thank you.",
        "Eric: It's not you. I've chosen Steffy to be C.E.O.",
        "Wyatt: Mom, will you stop?",
        "Quinn: Shh.",
        "Wyatt: Give Eric and Ridge some privacy.",
        "Quinn: No. And miss ridge's meltdown when he hears he's been passed over for C.E.O.? Unh-unh. No!",
        "Wyatt: Okay. Time to sit.",
        "Quinn: All right. Okay, fine, fine, fine. If the explosion is big enough, we should hear it in here.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, my God. Ridge isn't going to explode. No, he's not gonna be doing cartwheels, but Steffy still is his daughter.",
        "Quinn: Yes, and the heir apparent to him -- I get it -- after he's had his chance to be C.E.O. Oh, how the tables have turned -- the privileged prodigal son being bypassed. [Chuckling] You still think he's not going to explode? Ha! Oh, think again.",
        "Ridge: Steffy?",
        "Eric: Steffy. I believe she has everything it takes to run the company to lead it into the future.",
        "Ridge: Sure. Sure, she does. And, what, I don't?",
        "Eric: You can't expect me to brush aside everything that's happened, Ridge -- everything you did to me. It was all very hurtful.",
        "Ridge: That was never my intention. I really thought we've kind of --",
        "Eric: I know what you thought.",
        "Ridge: You just don't trust me, do you?",
        "Eric: I have every confidence in my granddaughter. I've been watching her for years. She has terrific strength inside. She has all the intelligence and savvy she needs to be C.E.O. of this company. You should know it was Quinn who suggested her. And I agree with my wife. I think she's be a terrific C.E.O., if she accepts.",
        "Liam: You're not hearing me.",
        "Steffy: I hear you. I just can't turn my back on my grandfather.",
        "Liam: I am not asking you to. I'm asking you to just remember all of the things she's done, all the crimes she's committed, the endless string of manipulations, the pathological need to make every single situation work out exactly the way that she needs it to, no matter what she has to do. This is how she conned her way into your grandfather's life, Steffy. And I am worried that she's gonna do the exact same thing with you, or worse, if you take the C.E.O. position.",
        "Steffy: I understand what you're saying. I share your concerns and your frustrations and your reservations. That's why I haven't said yes to my granddad. [Groans]",
        "Liam: But you want to.",
        "Steffy: I want Quinn gone. I want my family whole again, the way our lives were before she infested all of it. But if I turn this down... she'll solidify her position at the company and in my grandfather's life, and maybe that was her intention. Maybe if I said no, it would just clear a path -- the point is... if she was the only person who came to me and offered this, I would say no. But listening to my grandfather... everyone says I'm exactly like my grandma. But I'm like my grandfather, too, and this is an incredible opportunity.",
        "Liam: And you deserve it. I just -- it doesn't change the fact that Quinn is behind it, and you know, Steffy -- you know how this woman operates. Don't let her draw you in. Don't let her draw you in.",
        "Quinn: It all hinges on Steffy accepting the C.E.O. position, and if she does, it might be the first step in putting your relationship back together.",
        "Wyatt: [Scoffs] [Chuckles]",
        "Quinn: Huh?",
        "Wyatt: What about Liam? He's gonna push back, and hard.",
        "Quinn: No doubt. But if Steffy wants this badly enough -- and I believe she does -- nothing Liam can say or do will dissuade her.",
        "Steffy: My eyes are wide open. I know Quinn's all about ulterior motives.",
        "Liam: Yes, and this is no exception. The woman has total control at Forrester creations right now. Now, you tell me, what are the odds that she would give all of that up willingly for nothing? At the very least, she's trying to broker a reconciliation between you and my brother.",
        "Steffy: Okay, fine. Say that is what this is about for Quinn. That's not what this is about for my granddad.",
        "Liam: How do you know she's not manipulating him, too? How do you know that she's not playing on his sympathies? The loving mother whose happy marriage came at the expense of her son's.",
        "Steffy: It doesn't mean my granddad doesn't want this for me.",
        "Liam: You can't know what he wants right now! He's still recovering!",
        "Steffy: Seriously? Seriously? You're standing here, saying that you don't think my granddad can believe in me that way? Like, that's what he wants. I looked him in the eye. That's what he told me.",
        "Liam: He told you exactly what Quinn wanted him to tell you -- how much he trusts you, how you're the leader that Forrester has been waiting for. She's programming him, Steffy. She's programming him.",
        "Steffy: Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I had -- I had the most touching moment with my grandfather, and you're telling me they're just words that Quinn put in his mouth. You know, you can't degrade that.",
        "Liam: I'm not degrading it. I'm just -- I'm trying to get you to see the poison apple that Quinn is extending to you right now.",
        "Steffy: Oh, unbelievable.",
        "Liam: Steffy, Steffy, Quinn is in full manipulation mode -- full manipulation mode! How many times has she interfered in our lives, and how much damage has it done? How much suffering has it caused? You shouldn't be anywhere near that woman! Yes, yes, you deserve to be C.E.O. You should be. But not like this. Don't take the job.",
        "Ridge: Steffy hasn't accepted?",
        "Eric: No, not yet.",
        "Ridge: Because she's conflicted by a lot of things.",
        "Eric: It's a big decision, Ridge. She wants to take some time to think about it. I respect that.",
        "Ridge: And maybe she doesn't want to be in bed with Quinn. Maybe she wouldn't do that to Liam.",
        "Eric: Well, if this is what Steffy wants, Liam's gonna have to get behind it. He's gonna have to support her in this.",
        "Ridge: And what about her loyalty to her father? She knows it's my turn to run this company and to run this family. She -- she'll have her turn, but not now. Brooke and I are back together. We're a team. We're a great team. I know you haven't forgotten what we've done for this company.",
        "Eric: No, I haven't forgotten. I haven't forgotten all the scandals that were caused, either -- all the problems in the press that came between the two of you.",
        "Ridge: I know. I know there's still a strain between us, and I know that's why you're asking Steffy to do this. Can I ask you something? Can I ask you to remember... how much I love and respect you? We used to be so close, and I miss that. I really do. I did what I did -- for you, for this family, and for this company. I get it. I know I hurt you, Dad. But I'm not sure what do to now. What do I do? All I can do is, uh, be a better son and be -- be a better C.E.O. You groomed me for this all these years, and now I'm ready. And I now would like a chance to show you that I can run this company, that I can take it into the future with Brooke by my side. Appoint me C.E.O."
