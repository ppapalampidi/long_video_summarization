        "Ricky: Wow. That party was really something else. You know, I could really get into this. ",
        "Reese: You really are into it, baby. You better get used to it. The Stephen Clay Experience takes over your life, all day and all night. ",
        "Ricky: Really? So, wait -- so Stephen and Joshua still want to get together and work tonight? ",
        "Reese: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Ricky: And what do you want, Reese? ",
        "Reese: More. ",
        "Joshua: One of your fellow playmates is missing. ",
        "Reese: Josh. ",
        "Joshua: I'm looking for Marissa. She's supposed to be working on the new song tonight. ",
        "Ricky: I haven't seen her in a while. Something wrong, josh? ",
        "Joshua: No. Nothing that a healthy dose of commitment from all of you wouldn't cure. Stephen is ready to take this band to a whole new level. And nothing is more important than that. ",

        "Jamal: Oh, there we go. All right, now, come on, admit it, admit it. That was, like, the ride of your life. Come on, give props where props are due. ",
        "Marissa: Oh, please. The best ride of my -- my granny's moped's got more gas than that pile of chrome. ",
        "Jamal: Oh, oh, granny's -- ",
        "Marissa: Yeah. ",
        "Jamal: Oh, ok. ",
        "Marissa: What? You heard. ",
        "Jamal: I hope your shoes are comfortable. ",
        "Marissa: Why? ",
        "Jamal: Because you're going to be walking back to town where you came from. ",
        "Marissa: Oh, no, no, no, no! ",
        "Jamal: Oh, no, no, no, no. ",
        "Marissa: You are a wild man! ",
        "Jamal: Oh, I'm a wild man. ",
        "Marissa: You are a maniac. ",
        "Jamal: I'm a maniac. ",
        "Marissa: You are the hottest biker ever to roam the planet. ",
        "Jamal: More. Give it to me. ",
        "Marissa: And you're sexy and you're gorgeous and I want you and I missed you so much. ",
        "Jamal: That's what I'm saying. I missed you, too. ",
        "Marissa: You sound surprised. ",
        "Jamal: Well, yeah. Well, just by how much you missed me, that's all. ",
        "Marissa: Well, try sticking around a little longer. ",
        "Jamal: You read my mind. ",
        "Marissa: Oh. Jamal, the band, the band, the band. I forgot. I'm on the clock right now. I'm supposed to be working. ",
        "Jamal: No, see, what you need to be doing is working me over right now. I'll tell you what -- you can take as long as you want, ok? ",
        "Marissa: Yeah? ",
        "Jamal: Because I'm here for you. ",
        "Marissa: You're here for me? ",
        "Jamal: Yeah. ",
        "Marissa: Ok, well, I like the way that sounds much better. ",

        "[Knocking] ",
        "Stephen: You could just ignore that. ",
        "Elizabeth: Oh. It's my daughter. I got to deal with this. Just give me one second, ok? ",
        "[Knocking] ",
        "Alison: If you think that I am leaving, then you obviously don't know me very well. ",
        "Stephen: Leave, leave. ",
        "Elizabeth: Oh, God. No, I -- sorry, I can't do this, ok? I'm coming. Hold on. You -- I\u2019ll get rid of her, ok? You're not making this any easier. ",
        "Stephen: Nothing worth the wait ever is. ",

        "Alison: Ok. I'm counting to three. ",
        "Elizabeth: Sweetheart -- ",
        "Alison: Finally. ",
        "Elizabeth: This is not a good time. ",
        "Alison: Well, I don't really care. You've been barging in on me for weeks. ",
        "Elizabeth: No, just wait. ",
        "Alison: I wanted to give you something, some papers. God, you're a messy woman. What took you so long to get to the door? ",
        "Elizabeth: I was busy. ",
        "Alison: With what, your robe? What is that? ",
        "Elizabeth: No, Alison, wait. ",
        "Alison: This is a man's watch. Oh, my God. You have a man in here, don't you? ",

        "Jamal: You know what? For a first-time songwriter, you got some pretty nice moves. I don't know. ",
        "Marissa: You did ask for a workout, didn't you? ",
        "Jamal: Yeah. ",
        "Marissa: Yeah. ",
        "Jamal: And by golly, we're going to get one. ",
        "Marissa: Yeah. ",
        "Joshua: Only somebody's supposed to be working. ",
        "Marissa: Joshua -- is that you? ",
        "Joshua: Marissa. Mr. Woods. ",
        "Jamal: Look, unless you want to get hurt real bad, I suggest you don't go sneaking up on people like that. ",
        "Joshua: I shall try to remember that. ",
        "Marissa: What are you doing here? ",
        "Jamal: Besides spying on us. ",
        "Joshua: I'm protecting my investment. Do you really think Stephen\u2019s prepared to record anything that's absolutely less than perfect, Marissa? ",
        "Marissa: No, of course not. ",
        "Joshua: You were supposed to be working in the studio this evening. Or did you forget? ",
        "Marissa: No -- sorry, look, I didn't exactly forget. I just got kind of -- ",
        "Joshua: Distracted? When everyone's counting on you? The band's rehearsing. They're expecting new material. You made a commitment. ",
        "Marissa: Joshua, I said I was sorry, ok? I don't -- ",
        "Jamal: Look -- can I call you J? Look, do me a favor. Why don't you lose the attitude with her because you don't own her. ",
        "Marissa: Ok -- ",
        "Jamal: Ok? Look, she took tonight off, ok, so what's the big, hairy deal? And one more thing -- how did you end up finding us, anyway? ",
        "******************************************************************************",
        "Elizabeth: Alison, it is not what you think. ",
        "Alison: This is a man's watch, and I know it didn't come with the room. ",
        "Elizabeth: It isn't necessarily -- ",
        "Alison: What, are you hiding him in the bathroom? ",
        "Elizabeth: Will you just stop being so ridiculous? He obviously had to go. ",
        "Alison: Oh -- oh, just like that, huh? I can imagine. ",
        "Elizabeth: Well, he probably didn't want to endure my daughter's wrath. ",
        "Alison: My father has been dead a couple of months, and you're already shacking up with some guy in bed? Oh, no, wait, this is so stupid. Of course. Of course. Daddy is not the only one who had extramarital affairs. ",
        "Elizabeth: No, Alison -- ",
        "Alison: Great. ",
        "Elizabeth: Alison -- ",
        "Alison: How long has this been going on? A month? A week? Two years? A year? ",
        "Elizabeth: It's not like that. ",
        "Alison: Oh, it's not? Daddy liked it, huh? Did he? He didn't mind? ",
        "Elizabeth: Would you just stop, ok? I just met him, all right? You satisfied? ",
        "Alison: You just met him? ",
        "Elizabeth: Yeah, I just met him. It was just one of those things. ",
        "Alison: That's disgusting. So who is he? ",
        "Elizabeth: I don't really know that much about him. ",
        "Alison: Well, how about a name, for starters? You do know his name -- oh, my God, you don't even know his name? You slept with a guy, and you don't even know his name? How disgusting can you get? ",
        "Elizabeth: You know what? You just stop and just stop throwing all these accusations at me. Don't judge me. Yes, I slept with a stranger. Do you want to know why? ",
        "Alison: I can't wait. ",
        "Elizabeth: Alison, he told me that i was beautiful and i was exciting. And, god, he wanted me. Do you know how good that felt to have somebody want me? I would have given anything to have your father feel like that about me. ",
        "******************************************************************************",
        "Rafe: Oh, what's wrong with me? I mean, I'm starting to get my powers back. And some of them, I don't even know why. Something -- something's off. I'm just -- ",
        "Stephen: Do you mind if I join you? ",
        "Rafe: Yeah. Sure. ",
        "Stephen: Nothing like a good steam to sweat all the demons out, huh? ",
        "Rafe: Well, it's hot as hell in here, that's for sure. ",
        "Stephen: That's just the way I like it. ",
        "******************************************************************************",
        "Ricky: Where the heck is Cass, huh? We're never going to make it to rehearsal if he keeps holding us up. ",
        "Reese: Just relax, ok? ",
        "Ricky: I am relaxed. I'll relax when we get to rehearsal. ",
        "Reese: So, Ricky, you ever done it outside where anyone can see you, huh? ",
        "Ricky: Listen, Reese, this would be great. This would be really great sometime. But later, ok? ",
        "Reese: Come on, sexy. Nobody's watching. Besides, even if they were, it would be kind of hot, don't you think? ",
        "Ricky: I said some other time, Reese. So we hooked up. But it's not like we're soul mates here. Besides, the rehearsal. If this Cass would show up, we -- ",
        "Reese: So that's how you think it works, is it, Ricky? We hook up, and then you act like I don't even exist -- ",
        "Ricky: Wait a minute. Wait a minute. That's not what I meant. ",
        "Reese: Why is it that drummers always think they can get away with bloody murder? ",
        "Ricky: Hey, hey, hey -- you know what? Maybe hooking up was a mistake. I mean, after all, we're in the same band and we hardly know each other. ",
        "Reese: Oh, please. ",
        "Ricky: Ok. Let's take this a step back and concentrate on the job here. ",
        "Reese: Your music's so important to you, isn't it? ",
        "Ricky: Yeah, that's right, it is. And it's important to you, and we have a job to do here. I'm not going to let this band down. ",
        "Reese: Well, excuse me, Mr. Rock star, who's only in this band on a pass. Or didn't you know that, Ricky? ",
        "******************************************************************************",
        "Jamal: You followed us all the way out here to give my girl a hard time about exactly what? Lyrics, or what? ",
        "Joshua: Please, Mr. Woods. It was actually luck that I found you. ",
        "Jamal: Oh, luck. ",
        "Joshua: Yes. I ran into a friend of yours earlier who told me you like to ride out here. ",
        "Jamal: Oh, a friend of mine. Oh, ok. And what did you say his name was? ",
        "Joshua: You know, I don't recall. But as you put it so eloquently earlier, no big, hairy deal. ",
        "Marissa: Yeah, actually, Joshua, this is a very big deal, ok? Look, I'm sorry I missed our session tonight, but that doesn't give you or Stephen the right to track me down like I\u2019m some little kid. ",
        "Joshua: Is that all? ",
        "Marissa: No. Look, I understand that you guys work very intense and you have this routine, but you have to understand that I still get my private time, ok? And although it's really none of your business, this man is very important to my life, and you have to respect that. Are we clear? ",
        "Joshua: Crystal clear. Please forgive the intrusion. ",
        "Marissa: Thank you. ",
        "Joshua: In fact, take the rest of the evening off. We'll start out fresh in the morning. ",
        "Jamal: That's a great idea. Well, good night, J. ",
        "Marissa: Great. So, I will see you tomorrow in the morning. ",
        "Joshua: Excuse me. ",
        "Jamal: Where were we? Where were we before we were so rudely interrupted? ",
        "Joshua: Hello? It's me. We have a problem. Jamal Woods is becoming an impediment. No. No, don't bother Stephen. I can handle this. ",
        "******************************************************************************",
        "Alison: Do you really expect me to feel sorry for you? ",
        "Elizabeth: I don't expect you to understand it at all. But that's just how life was with your father, Alison. I loved him, and he loved elsewhere. ",
        "Alison: Don't you ever think about things at all? I mean, what if this guy was dangerous? Maybe he told you all of those great little things to make you feel all warm and fuzzy just so he'd get you in a room alone? ",
        "Elizabeth: Alison, I have been around the world more times than i can count, and I have known a man or two. You don't have to mother me. I should be doing that to you. ",
        "Alison: You're right. But you didn't because you weren't around. ",
        "Elizabeth: And it's always this, isn't it? It always comes back to this. ",
        "Alison: We really don't have a lot to go on, now, do we? You're the one who said we need to make it legal before we can trust each other. ",
        "Elizabeth: Did you sign the contract? ",
        "Alison: Yeah, I signed your agreement, so now we have a deal. You list every single person that my father ever slept with and had an affair with. ",
        "Elizabeth: So that you can find your missing brother or sister? ",
        "Alison: Yeah, maybe. ",
        "Elizabeth: So that you can find your missing family? ",
        "Alison: That is what i want. ",
        "Elizabeth: Well, you know the funny thing about what we want -- ask and you may not find what you're looking for. ",
        "******************************************************************************",
        "Stephen: This feels so good after the night I had tonight. ",
        "Rafe: Really? ",
        "Stephen: Yeah. I met this woman. A real knockout. ",
        "Rafe: Yeah. ",
        "Stephen: Maybe a little on the needy side, but nice, if you know what i mean. ",
        "Rafe: Uh-huh. That's wonderful. Thanks for sharing. ",
        "Stephen: You got a woman? ",
        "Rafe: Yes, actually I'm engaged. ",
        "Stephen: Hey, congratulations. ",
        "Rafe: Uh-huh. ",
        "Stephen: You're ready to take on the old ball and chain, huh? ",
        "Rafe: I -- I guess so. ",
        "Stephen: To love, honor, and obey till death do you part? ",
        "Rafe: Yeah, pal -- you know what? I really came in here to be alone. I got a lot on my mind, so I\u2019d appreciate it if you just kind of just let me be. ",
        "Stephen: Man, I\u2019m sorry. I understand. ",
        "Rafe: Yeah, thank you. ",
        "Stephen: Do you mind if I turn some music on? ",
        "Rafe: Yeah, go -- go ahead. ",
        "Stephen: Ok. ",
        "Rafe: Do whatever you want. ",

        "Ricky: What do you mean, I'm here on a pass? I'm a good drummer, as good as they come. ",
        "Reese: Just forget everything i said. ",
        "Ricky: No, no, no, no, no -- ",
        "Reese: You're the best man, one of a kind, ok? ",
        "Ricky: Reese, what do you think you know? ",
        "Reese: Look, it doesn't matter how or why you got here. You're here, ok? ",
        "Ricky: Reese, get over here. You either tell me right now, or I\u2019m going to go to Joshua and Stephen and then -- ",
        "Reese: All right! Fine. The only reason you're in this band is because of Marissa. ",
        "Ricky: What? ",
        "Reese: You're a charity case, Ricky. It's the truth. Your little friend wouldn't write unless Stephen took you on. ",
        "******************************************************************************",
        "Jamal: You know, I really like how you stood up to Joshua. ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, I liked that. I liked that. So, I'm a priority now? Huh? Is that what I heard? ",
        "Marissa: Ain't nobody comes between me and my man. ",
        "Jamal: What, not even the big boss? ",
        "Marissa: Big boss doesn't mess with me because I know kung fu. ",
        "Jamal: Oh. That's cool. With that black belt, you'll be the first person I call every time I get into a jam, all right? ",
        "[Phone rings] ",
        "Marissa: Yeah. ",
        "Jamal: All right. Wait, wait, wait. One second, baby girl. ",
        "Marissa: Just one -- one second. ",
        "Jamal: Shh. Jamal. What up? Hey, yeah. Yeah, yeah, of course I do. I got two of them. What, do you -- are you sure you want to pay that -- no, no, no, fine, fine, fine. Ok. Got it. I will be right there. It was good doing business with you, too. All right, bye. ",
        "Marissa: What? ",
        "Jamal: Another sale, two bikes, and the price is kind of off the charts. ",
        "Marissa: Jamal, that's so good! ",
        "Jamal: Yeah, yeah, it's good. There's just a downside to it -- I have to deliver them, so -- ",
        "Marissa: Oh. Well, how long are you going to be gone this time? ",
        "Jamal: Look, I'll tell you what -- I don't -- I can pass this up, ok? I mean, then we can spend some time together. ",
        "Marissa: No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, honey, no. No, it's ok. You do -- I know you could use the money right now, so it's cool. When are you leaving? ",
        "Jamal: Tonight. ",
        "Marissa: What? ",
        "Jamal: Come on, come on -- ",
        "Marissa: Jamal, you just got back. ",
        "Jamal: No, no, don't look at me like that. Come on, please. I miss you, too. I don't want to leave you again just like this. ",
        "Marissa: I'm going to miss you. ",
        "Jamal: I'm going to miss you, too, pretty girl. More than you think. Ok? And I'll hurry back as soon as I can. ",

        "Jamal: Quick fast. ",
        "Marissa: Quick fast fast. ",
        "Jamal: Quick fast. Quick fast, I promise. Now, come on, we better get out of here, so the sooner I can get out of here, the sooner I can get back to you, right? ",
        "Marissa: Right. ",
        "Jamal: Right. ",
        "Marissa: And when you get back, then nothing and nobody is going to get in our way. ",
        "Jamal: That's right. That's the way it'll be. ",
        "Marissa: Mm-hmm. ",
        "Jamal: Now, come on. Let's get out of here, baby girl. ",
