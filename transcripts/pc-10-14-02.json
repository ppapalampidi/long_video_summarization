        "Jamal: I know, I know.",
        "Marissa: Jamal, that is awesome!",
        "Ricky: What? Whoa, hold on a minute. You get mad at me for going through your\r\nstuff, but jamal here makes it public and it's awesome?",
        "Marissa: Well, ricky, i told you it was wrong of me to give you such a hard\r\ntime, but you wrote a beautiful song.",
        "Ricky: Yeah, a song that's not ready for anybody else to listen to, marissa.",
        "Jamal: No, ricky, come on, come on, the song is hot. What are you talking\r\nabout, not ready? It's going to knock them on their butts, man.",
        "Ricky: You don't know what you're talking about. It doesn't work like that.",
        "Jamal: Ok, fine, fine, it's a long shot, but so what? What do you have to\r\nlose?",
        "Marissa: Yeah, and we could actually get discovered.",
        "Ricky: Look, guys, I love the fact that you guys like the song, all right,\r\nbut that's not how rock works, ok? This is more --",
        "jamal: Oh, here we go.",
        "Ricky: Than just a long shot. There's no way in hell that a band like the\r\nstephen clay experience is going to waste their time on a bunch of small-town\r\nnobodies like us. No way.",
        "Jack: Tess? Tess, what is it, what is it? What's wrong? Talk to me, talk to\r\nme. It's jack. I'm here, I'm here. Tess, tess, it's me. It's jack. Can you hear\r\nme? Tess!",
        "Livvie: Oh, god, oh, the poison. My baby -- my baby -- wait -- oh. I got to\r\nget out of here. I got to get out of here.",
        "Rafe: Ok, this is a joke, right? I mean, elizabeth, this woman i met outside\r\nthe recovery room, she's not really your mom.",
        "Elizabeth: I am just amazed. I -- i mean, at first my rental car breaks down,\r\nand then I meet this lovely young man who's nice enough to give me a ride to my\r\nhotel, the whole time just going on and on about this wonderful girl that he's\r\nso in love with. Here it is my own daughter.",
        "Alison: What are you doing here?",

        "Elizabeth: Well, these last few months -- they've just been really tough,\r\nalison. I'm -- i'm sorry. I know i've been out of touch.",
        "Alison: I don't mean to be rude, but we both know that you didn't travel all\r\nthis way just to see me. So why don't we cut all this small talk and why don't\r\nyou tell me the real reason why you're back. Why are you here in port charles?",

        "Frank: That was because you are amazing and I am a lucky guy to have you.",
        "Karen: Uh, yes, you are.",
        "Frank: No, I mean it, karen. I know how hard it was for you finding out I'm\r\nthe father of livvie's baby, having to accept the fact that they're going to be\r\na part of our lives. Well, you add that with everything else that's happened\r\nbetween us and, well, not a lot of women would hang in there.",
        "Karen: I made my choice, frank. I won't pretend it's a situation i would've\r\nasked for. But I know you're a good man, and I'm glad you're going to be\r\ninvolved in raising the child. With a mother like livvie, it'll need all the\r\nlove it can get.",
        "Livvie: Help me. Somebody help me.",
        "Frank: Livvie.",
        "Livvie: Please, don't let me die!",

        "[Livvie wheezes]",
        "alison: What is, mother? I mean, are you here for a business thing or is it,\r\nlike, a social engagement? I know it's not about money because you have all the\r\nmoney in the world.",
        "Elizabeth: Alison, I came to see you.",
        "Alison: Oh, really? Gosh, what's the special occasion?",
        "Elizabeth: Let me explain.",
        "Alison: Because usually when mothers come to see their daughters, it's a very\r\nnatural and normal thing. But in the barrington world, it's very unheard of.",
        "Elizabeth: Ok, now, that isn't fair.",
        "Rafe: That isn't fair? You can't mean that, can you?",
        "Elizabeth: Ok, obviously, alison has filled you in on our relationship.",
        "Alison: Relationship? What relationship? We've never had a relationship ever\r\nat all.",
        "Rafe: You know, I called your husband once. Did he tell you that?",
        "Elizabeth: I believe he mentioned some young man calling once. We were in new\r\nzealand.",
        "Rafe: Yeah, yeah, yeah. That was me. See, i wanted to surprise alison and I\r\nwanted to give her something that she really wanted. And all you had to do was\r\nshow up. But you couldn't do that, just like you couldn't show up when she was\r\nin a coma, fighting for her life, or on trial for a murder that she didn't\r\ncommit.",
        "Alison: Yeah, not to mention birthdays or, like, my graduation, you know?",
        "Rafe: So if she has questions why you're here, so do i.",
        "Elizabeth: Here i thought you and I were going to hit it off so well.",
        "Rafe: Yeah, well, guess that was before i knew who you were.",
        "Elizabeth: You're right. You're both right. I -- i have been a terrible\r\nmother, and I am so sorry. Alison, I feel awful about the way that i've\r\nneglected you, but that doesn't mean that i don't care. I mean, you have got to\r\nbelieve me. I love you so much. I always have. I think about you constantly,\r\nalways wishing that I could just be with you and --",
        "alison: Stop it.",
        "Elizabeth: And here i finally see you and --",
        "alison: Stop it.",
        "Elizabeth: Honey, you're --",
        "alison: Please don't. No, no, no, stop it!",
        "Elizabeth: My precious, little girl!",
        "Alison: Do not embarrass yourself here, please, and do this whole\r\nregretful-mother thing. I don't need it.",
        "Elizabeth: Please, alison, just -- if you just listen to me.",
        "Alison: Stop it. Don't walk in here and do this whole tear thing, ok, pretend\r\nyou're really sorry. You're my mom, and you ignored me for 21 years. How do you\r\nthink that makes me feel? I'm not buying what you're selling. So why don't you\r\njust get to it and tell me why you're really here so that we can just get on\r\nwith it.",
        "Elizabeth: I already told you why.",
        "Alison: I don't believe you. And I am sure that if you didn't run into rafe,\r\nyou probably wouldn't even have called me, let me know you were in town.",
        "Elizabeth: Alison, I came here to see you! I just came to see you!",
        "Alison: What is this sudden urgency?",
        "Elizabeth: Your father!",
        "Alison: Daddy?",
        "Elizabeth: Yes.",
        "Alison: Well, what about him?",
        "Elizabeth: Ok, you know, let's -- i didn't want to do it like this, ok?",
        "Alison: Do what?",
        "Elizabeth: No, ok, let's just calm down --",
        "alison: No, let's not.",
        "Elizabeth: And let's just start over again.",
        "Alison: Let's not just calm down or do anything. What about him? What is it?",
        "Elizabeth: He's gone.",
        "Alison: He's gone? Did he actually leave you? It doesn't actually surprise\r\nme.",
        "Elizabeth: He died, alison. Your father's dead.",
        "Marissa: Ricky, why are you being so negative about this?",
        "Ricky: I'm not being negative. I'm just being realistic.",
        "Jamal: Oh, realistic? Based on what, all of your years in the music business?\r\nIs that what it is?",
        "Ricky: Yes, i know how this works, man.",
        "Jamal: Right, right.",
        "Marissa: Ok, ok, why don't you tell us how it works, hot shot?",
        "Jamal: Yeah, yeah, tell us how it works.",
        "Ricky: Fine. All right. First you start with a song.",
        "Jamal: \"You start with a song.\"",
        "Ricky: You want to listen to this?",
        "Jamal: I'm listening. Fine. Go. Start with a song.",
        "Ricky: All right, you tweak the song till it's just right, then you take it\r\nto a recording studio and you record it professionally.",
        "Then your agent sends it to the band, where it'll sit in a c.D. Stack with\r\nthe rest of the other c.D.S. Stephen clay might listen to it. He probably\r\ndoesn'T. All right, here's what you don't do. You don't take a song that's a\r\nrough cut, that you recorded in your bedroom, and you send it to the band\r\nexpecting for something to happen.",
        "Marissa: It might if you were just a little more positive, ricky.",
        "Ricky: You think I don't want this? You think that i haven't dreamt about\r\nthis? I want this so bad that I can taste it, but you don't go around sending\r\nthese people a C.D. What makes you think our c.D.'S going to stand out, huh? The\r\nband probably won't listen to it.",
        "Jamal: Dude --",
        "ricky: They won't even see it.",
        "Jamal: Look, ricky, i'm not stupid, ok? I didn't send the C.D. Out cold, all\r\nright?",
        "Ricky: So what did you do, jamal?",
        "Jamal: Look, just don't worry about it, ok? I'm connected. I got it covered,\r\nall right?",
        "Ricky: Oh, all right, you're connected -- my bad, my bad.",
        "Jamal: Yes, i do.",
        "Ricky: How are you connected?",
        "Jamal: Look, my guy's going to make sure that stephen clay not only sees the\r\nC.D. But that he listens to the whole thing.",
        "Ricky: All right. So who is this guy?",
        "Jamal: The dude who i fixed a bike for. Turns out that his roommate knows the\r\nguy who's the band's road manager.",
        "Ricky: Oh, really?",
        "Jamal: What, dude?",
        "Ricky: I'm sorry. You know the guy who knows the guy who knows the guy who's\r\ntheir road manager.",
        "Jamal: Yeah.",
        "Ricky: My bad. White stripes, move over.",
        "Marissa: Ok, you know what, ricky?",
        "Jamal: Whatever, dude --",
        "marissa: Your attitude is really foul right now, ok? Jamal was trying to do a\r\nnice thing here.",

        "Marissa: Hello? Who? Stephen clay?",
        "Alison: Um, how did it happen? How did he die?",
        "Elizabeth: It was a boating accident. We were sailing the yacht on the aegean\r\nwith some friends, socializing, drinking, and your father went out on the deck\r\nto get a breath of fresh air and he just must have leaned over the rail too far\r\nbecause he fell. He fell overboard. And his body -- his body's never been found.\r\nWe -- we searched and we searched. We exhausted every resource that money could\r\nbuy. He just -- he just vanished. He's gone. Just like that, my husband's gone.\r\nAlison, I'm so sorry that you had to hear it like this. I -- it is so important\r\nfor you to know that your father loved you so, so much. And what he would've\r\nwanted right now is for you and i to be together. Alison, we're all each other\r\nhas.",
        "Alison: Um -- I'm sure that you're very exhausted. So i will call you a cab.",
        "Karen: You're doing ok. Hold on.",
        "Livvie's voice: A bath is so warm and inviting, alison. I know how you used\r\nto always love one. So enjoy it. Because it'll be your last. My god. All right,\r\ni have to get the ring out before alison catches me. How do i -- how do i get it\r\nout without getting the poison on me? Ok. Where is it?",
        "Livvie: Got it. Got it. Ah!",
        "Karen: Livvie, tell me what happened. Why do you think you're dying?",
        "Livvie: Oh!",

        "Livvie: I think I was poisoned.",
        "Karen: Poisoned? How? With what?",
        "Livvie: I took a bath and I think I had an allergic reaction to something. I\r\ndon't know. There was something in the water.",
        "Karen: Ok, and that's why you had trouble breathing?",
        "Livvie: Oh, my chest! Karen, please! My chest hurts so bad!",

        "Elizabeth: You know, alison, it's funny because this time, actually, I don't\r\nhave to leave. In fact, i was thinking that it would be good if i stayed a while\r\nso that we could spend some time together.",
