        "Katie tells Brooke that she may not believe it but she is a good CEO. Brooke says Bill should not be apart from his company or his job. She points out that Katie is with Ridge now, a much better place, so stop punishing Bill. Just let him have his job back. Quinn tells Wyatt that she can handle this. He can go find Hope. Wyatt says that he knows she is with Liam so he doesn't care what they are doing. He's not worried as he knows he is the one she will end up with. Quinn pages Pam and tries to find out where Hope is if she is not in the building. She tells Wyatt that Hope is out gallivanting with Liam. Wyatt admits okay, equal time sucks. Hope and Liam continue to look over the animal shelter and meet up with Councilman Bernard Parks who agrees to answer some of Liam's questions for his article. He says there is a major shift in the euthanasia rate over the last few years. But if you leave here without understanding some of the medical issues, those animals will end up coming back. Hope says that is sad because a term she hears a lot and really loves if \"forever home.\" Later they meet Brenda, the manager of the Los Angeles Animal Services. She's been active in animal rescue for over 35 years. For many years the dog pound was a place you did not want to go. But after spending some time here you see that it is a place to go. They have love in all packages, big, little, young and old and they are all spayed and neutered. If they could get more people across the country when they are ready for a companion animal \u0096 go to a shelter we'd be a no-kill nation very quickly. Bill is surprised to look up and find Ridge and asks what he wants. Ridge says he is there to pick up Will for Katie. Bill makes a snarky remark that Katie is too busy to do this herself. And he refuses to let Ridge take Will. Ridge says he and Katie need to figure this out but meantime he is taking her son. Brooke tells Katie that she must feel bad that 1% made her CEO. She says no, Karen's 50% makes her CEO. Brooke says Karen has issues with Bill and she swooped in here ad took advantage. And she understands that Katie is the betrayed wife and wants to torture Bill a little bit. But he's paid the price. Enough is enough. It's time to make this right. Katie says again she loves this job and she is not going to walk away. Brooke asks if she will at least share custody of Will since Katie is working so much. Katie reminds her that Bill willingly walked away from the marriage so custody remains unchanged. And she is going to remain as CEO and there is nothing Brooke can do about that. Brooke says she can not accept that. They are sisters and she really doesn't want to do this, but what she is doing is wrong and if she doesn't fix it, Brooke will.",
        "Bill tells Ridge that he is sick of this; waiting for his life to fall in place. He wants it all, his son, his company and Brooke but Katie is denying him that and she's wrong. Katie tells Brooke that she's done her best to convince her but she has to go meet Ridge now as he is picking up Will. Brooke says no, Will is spending the night with her and Bill. She reminds Katie that she signed papers. Katie says Brooke destroyed them. Brooke says she did not ever say that. And they are still valid, returning Bill as CEO and equal custody of Will. Katie begs her not to use those papers against her. She knows what Bill did to get her to sign. Brooke says Bill is not using her as he knows nothing about this. She tried to talk to Karen and she talked to Katie just now but neither would listen. So now she has to take matters in her own hands to make it right. Bill tells Ridge that maybe \"man-to-man\" was too much to ask but Ridge is not taking Will anyplace. Ridge says his time is up and yes he is taking Will. Brooke walks in the door and says he is not. Will is staying here. Ridge gets a phone call and then abruptly leaves. Bill wonders what Brooke did. She hands him the papers and they hug. Hope falls in love with a white kitten as she holds him. Liam tells her that one has a new home; he's being adopted ..he's theirs. That brings a smile to her face and she calls the cat, Honey Butt. She thanks Liam for truly making this one of the best days yet and she kisses him."

        "Katie: Look, I know you don't believe this, but I work hard here at Spencer publications, and I'm a good C.E.O.",
        "Brooke: But you're not Bill.",
        "Katie: No, and most of the employees here are grateful for that.",
        "Brooke: Come on. This is killing Bill -- being away from his job, being apart from his child. We're all in better places now, right? You're with Ridge. So please stop punishing Bill... and just let him have his job back.",
        "Bill: [Growling playfully] [Sighs] About five more minutes -- that's all we have -- and then she's taking you away from me... like everything else.",
        "Quinn: I can handle this.",
        "Wyatt: What?",
        "Quinn: Go find hope.",
        "Wyatt: Why? I'm working. I-I don't need to know what hope is doing.",
        "Quinn: Maybe not, but who she's with -- yeah, you need to know that.",
        "Wyatt: Look, why should I care if she's spending time with Liam, huh? Why should that bother me? I-I know I'm the one she's gonna end up with.",
        "[Dogs barking]",
        "[Barking continues]",
        "Leslie: Hi. Hope and Liam, I'd like you to meet somebody.",
        "Liam: Oh, my god. Bernard parks. I know exactly who you are.",
        "Leslie: Councilman Bernard parks.",
        "Hope: Hi. I'm hope.",
        "Councilman parks: Hi, hope.",
        "Hope: Good to meet you.",
        "Liam: Pleasure to meet you. Would you mind if I asked you some questions?",
        "Councilman parks: I'd be glad to answer them.",
        "Liam: Oh, this is great. Do you think that this represents a cultural shift in the way that people have started to respond to and think about, uh, strays and animals and the way that we treat them?",
        "Councilman parks: I think it's a major shift, when you look at the euthanasia rate -- cut in half over the last several years.",
        "Liam: Cut in half.",
        "Councilman parks: And then you start looking at issues and with preventive and training, but if you leave here and not understand the responsibility...",
        "Liam: Right.",
        "Councilman parks: If you leave here and not understand what the medical issues, how to care for the animal, they'll be right back to us either by picking up a stray or people just bringing them back and saying, \"I'm unable to care for them.\"",
        "Hope: And that's so sad because a term that I hear a lot that I really love is \"forever home.\"",
        "Councilman parks: That's right.",
        "Hope: You should know that when you're adopting, this is a part of your family now, and -- and I think the \"forever home\" term is really great for people to hear.",
        "Councilman parks: What we find in the community -- often, there are people who buy rabbits during Easter, and a week later, they find they don't want to care for them, or they find a reptile where they realize how big it gets. And so all those things are part of the education that if you're going to purchase and care for an animal, these are the things you have to have throughout the lifetime.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs] Pam, it's -- it's Quinn. Pl-- I need a favor. Please don't make me ask donna. [Inhales, exhales deeply] I'm looking for hope. Is she around?",
        "[Dogs barking]",
        "Brandon: Hope, Liam, meet Brenda Barnette. She's general manager of los Angeles animal services.",
        "Liam: You are just the woman I wanted to talk to, actually. Do you mind if I ask you a few questions? So, how long have you been doing this? How long have you been involved in animal rescue?",
        "Brenda: Oh, probably 35-plus years.",
        "Liam: 35 years. Wow. That is fantastic. Okay, it seems to me that facilities aren't enough. Education seems to be the key. Are there other places that are doing what we're doing here? Is it happening more? Is it happening less?",
        "Brenda: Well, I think it's a growing movement across the country, and you see it, you know, in small communities and in large communities. You know, if we promote our animals better -- for many, many years, the dog pound was sort of that place that you don't go.",
        "Liam: Right.",
        "Brenda: But after spending some time here, you can see it is the place that you do go. We have love in all-sized packages. We have big. We have little. We have old. We have young. They're all spayed and neutered. They're microchipped and vaccinated. So, if we could get more people across the country -- when they are ready for a new companion animal -- to go to a shelter, we would be a no-kill nation very quickly.",
        "Bill: I'm just gonna gather up --",
        "Ridge: Spencer.",
        "Bill: What the hell are you doing here?",
        "Ridge: Here to pick up will.",
        "Bill: Come again?",
        "Ridge: Katie sent me.",
        "Brooke: Part of you has to feel bad about this. 1% of the company makes you C.E.O.?",
        "Katie: No. Karen's 50% of the company makes me C.E.O. I'm sorry.",
        "Brooke: Okay, well, Karen obviously has issues with Bill. I'm not sure if she's jealous or what, but she swooped right in to take advantage of this.",
        "Katie: [Sighs]",
        "Brooke: A betrayed wife -- of course you want to torture Bill a little bit, but you succeeded. Enough is enough, Katie. It's time to make this right.",
        "Bill: So, I guess Katie's too busy to come herself?",
        "Ridge: [Sighs] You know what it's like running a company. You need some help picking up?",
        "Bill: I don't think so.",
        "Ridge: Okay. Diaper bag's upstairs?",
        "Bill: He's not going anywhere with you.",
        "Ridge: Oh, boy. You and Katie have got to figure this stuff out, but for now, I'm taking her son. I'm sorry.",
        "Katie: I know you don't get it, Brooke, but I love this job. I'm not gonna walk away from it.",
        "Brooke: Okay. Then, please, if this job is so important to you, could you at least change your mind about custody?",
        "Katie: What does that have to do with anything?",
        "Brooke: You're here most of the time doing Bill's job. At least you could let him spend some time with his son.",
        "Katie: Bill willingly walked away from our marriage. That means he doesn't get an all-access pass to our son. I'm sorry, Brooke, but custody remains the same. I'm going to remain as C.E.O., And there's really nothing you can do about that.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] I can't accept that answer.",
        "Katie: Well, I don't know what you want me to say, Brooke.",
        "Brooke: We're sisters, and I really don't want to do this. I don't want our relationship to suffer any more than it already has.",
        "Katie: [Sighs]",
        "Brooke: What you're doing is wrong... so if you're not going to fix it, Katie, I will.",
        "Quinn: How can Pam not know anything? She keeps tabs on everybody.",
        "Wyatt: Not that it matters where hope is.",
        "[Telephone buzzes]",
        "Quinn: Hey. Hey, Pam. Any luck? And they're not at Spencer, either? [Sighs] All right, Pam. Thank you.",
        "Wyatt: Well?",
        "Quinn: Just what I thought. Hope's off gallivanting with Liam.",
        "Wyatt: All right, fine! I'll admit it. Ual time sucks.",
        "Brandon: Hey, watch me. Watch me. Good. Good. Watch me. Hey.",
        "Liam: Hey, Brandon, who you got here?",
        "Brandon: Oh, this is Sadie. She just came in. She was found on the street as a stray. You can see she's in really bad shape right now.",
        "Liam: Yeah.",
        "Brandon: What I'm doing right here -- I'm just kind of gaining the power of trust on her. Obviously, she's never been treated very well, so...",
        "Liam: Have you -- has she ever had training before at all?",
        "Brandon: I don't think much. Come here, sweetie. Come here. Come on. There you go. But she obviously doesn't have much trust in people, so all I'm trying to do is form some sort of a bond with her right now, and the way I do that is with treats. It's a slow process, but while she's down, I'm gonna form a bond with her. Good, good, good. There you go. Nice.",
        "Hope: [Chuckles]",
        "Liam: Aww.",
        "Hope: Sweet girl.",
        "Liam: Yeah.",
        "Brandon: Good. It all begins with saving a life. That's what we're doing here at these shelters. Be sure to have your pet spayed or neutered. And when you're choosing a new pet, be sure to come to the shelter -- save a life. Make a lucky dog or cat.",
        "Katie: I know you've spoken with Karen, and you made your opinion very clear... but she still wants me in charge.",
        "Brooke: She can only dictate that because of your 1%. But I've confirmed something with Justin. As long as ownership of Spencer is 50/50 between Bill and Karen, Bill is C.E.O.",
        "Katie: Well, that's not going to happen because I have my 1% and Karen's faith. That's not changing.",
        "Bill: I'm sick of this.",
        "Ridge: I understand.",
        "Bill: No. You don't. I'm tired of waiting for my life to fall into place.",
        "Ridge: Well, at least you got Brooke.",
        "Bill: Yes, I do. But I want it all -- my son, my company. Katie's been denying me of all of it -- time with my own kid out of spite, stealing my company. It's wrong.",
        "Katie: Listen, Brooke, I'm sorry -- I really am. You've done your best to convince me, but nothing's gonna change, so if you'll excuse me, I have to meet Ridge. He's picking up will.",
        "Brooke: No.",
        "Katie: What?",
        "Brooke: Will is spending the night with Bill and me.",
        "Katie: No. No, he's not.",
        "Brooke: Bill made mistakes, but he's paid the price, and you've got to stop this punishment.",
        "Katie: Brooke, I told you -- I'm not changing my mind about this.",
        "Brooke: You signed papers, Katie.",
        "Katie: You destroyed those papers.",
        "Brooke: Did I say that? They're still valid. Returning Bill as C.E.O. And giving him equal custody of will.",
        "Katie: You switched those papers to make things right.",
        "Brooke: Yes, for you. And now I need to make things right for Bill.",
        "Katie: Don't do this, Brooke. Don't use those against me. You know what he did to get me to sign those papers!",
        "Brooke: But you signed them, didn't you? And they're legal...effective immediately.",
        "Katie: He conned me. He lied to me. He lied to you, and now he's using you.",
        "Brooke: No, he's not. He doesn't know anything about this. I tried, Katie, to talk to you. I tried to talk to Karen. But you wouldn't listen to me.",
        "Katie: [Sighs]",
        "Brooke: So now I have to take matters into my own hands, and I have to make it right.",
        "Katie: I won't let you.",
        "Brooke: As you said, there's nothing you can do about it.",

        "Liam: [Chuckles] Hey. Hi.",
        "Hope: Look at him.",
        "Liam: Yeah.",
        "Hope: I love him.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles]",
        "Hope: Should we put him back in his cage?",
        "Liam: Uh, no, not this one. He's got a new home.",
        "Hope: Oh, really? He's been adopted?",
        "Liam: Yeah. He's ours.",
        "Hope: Really?",
        "Liam: [Chuckling] Yeah.",
        "Hope: Ohh.",
        "Bill: Let me ask you something, man-to-man... father-to-father. This feel right to you -- taking my son?",
        "Ridge: It's a complicated situation.",
        "Bill: Right. I guess \"man-to-man\" was too much to ask. But you're not taking him anywhere. You can tell Katie when she's done with work, I'll bring him over to the house.",
        "Ridge: But that's not the arrangement, Billy. Your time is up. I told Katie I'd bring her son to her, and that's exactly what I'm gonna do.",
        "Brooke: No, you're not. You're not taking will anywhere.",
        "Hope: They're bringing him right back, right?",
        "Liam: Oh, yeah. They're just getting him ready for you.",
        "Hope: Liam, this is... thank you. Really, this is truly a day that I will never forget. Thank you.",
