        "Lt. Baker informs Sally that she is under arrest for grand larceny and espionage. Before he takes her away Thomas wants to speak to her alone. She tells him that she is so sorry to put him through this. Shirley is ecstatic that more orders are pouring in. But she's worried about Sally and wonders where she is. Lt. Baker says he will take Sally downtown and book her but RJ is hoping Thomas talking to her that they will work something out. Steffy says she does not want Sally to go to prison but she brought this on herself and now has to pay the coincidences. Sally tells Thomas that nothing gained is worth the look in his eyes right now. Coco says she needs to call and tell Grams. She tells Grams that they are at FC and she has turned herself in, more details as she finds out. Pam offers to bring Lt. Baker another of his famous dogs. Steffy says she takes no pleasure in putting Sally in prison. Carter says she doesn't have to press charges. Steffy says yes if not it would be open season on FC. Thomas says he is at a loss. She claims everyone was counting on her and she wanted to do it right with her designs and her vision. But the first review made her doubt herself and Grams pushed her to go back to their original plan for knockoffs and it was her idea to use Coco with the camera. Thomas says he loved her and he would have helped her with anything if she had trusted and asked him. All she had to do was reach out; instead she stole from him and his family.",
        "Shirley tells Saul that Big Mouth just waltzed over to FC and turned herself in. Saul is besides himself. Coco tells Steffy that she understands if she does not want to hear her but there is something she would like to say. She knows what Sally did was wrong but she is not this evil, calculating person and she was caught in the middle of a big mistake. But as a sister she does not want to see her go to prison. Steffy says she understands but she does not like seeing her brother get hurt either so Sally will have to suffer the coincidences. Sally tells Thomas that he is looking at the world's biggest fool so she understands his position. She hurt her two favorite people in this world, him and Coco. But she told him who she was, a Spectra with lying and stealing in her DNA. She laments that she will stop production and tell the public no more products so she can at least do that. She says they had Australia but now he must not walk, but run as far away as he can. Coco tries again to get Steffy to reconsider and think of other damages less than prison. Sally says she will make it in prison. She is going where she belongs. She will roll up her sleeves and do what she has to do. They had a big, wonderful shot at something good but she threw it away so she deserves to go to prison, so get the ball rolling. Call the detective in. Thomas hugs her and she sheds a few tears before Lt. Baker comes in followed by a tearful Coco. Lt. Baker puts the cuffs on Sally and slowly leads her out the door."

        "Steffy: Thomas...a, you're under arrest for industrial espionage and grand larceny.",
        "R.J.: Okay, does this really need to happen?",
        "Steffy: We can't let people steal from us with no consequence.",
        "Lt. Baker: Please turn around.",
        "Thomas: Wait! I need a minute alone with Sally.",
        "Steffy: Thomas...",
        "Thomas: Stef. Please, just give me a minute.",
        "Sally: I'm so sorry.",
        "Shirley: [Gasps] More orders!",
        "Saul: Yeah, they just came in.",
        "Shirley: [Squeals] This is fantastic.",
        "Saul: Success beyond our wildest dreams.",
        "Shirley: Ooh, and some of our dreams are pretty wild.",
        "Saul: You know, I could, uh... I could use some help.",
        "Shirley: Well, Darlita's gonna be in in a few minutes.",
        "Saul: Well, you're standing right there. Thank you. Um, here. Why don't you, uh, sort these by the design number?",
        "Shirley: Where is Sally?",
        "Saul: Not in the building.",
        "Pam: So, what happened?",
        "R.J.: Sally confessed.",
        "Pam: To stealing our designs?",
        "Carter: Yep. Owned it.",
        "Pam: Well, that lets coco off the hook, then, right? For having to make a statement against her sister. What happens to Sally?",
        "Lt. Baker: I'll take her downtown and book her.",
        "R.J.: Just give Thomas and Sally a little time. Maybe they'll be able to work something out.",
        "Coco: Is -- is that possible?",
        "Steffy: Sally's committed multiple crimes against us.",
        "Carter: Industrial espionage, grand larceny...",
        "Steffy: Coco, I know this is rough for you, and as upset as I am, I -- I just want you to know that I don't want to see your sister in prison. But Sally, she brought this on herself, she made a choice, and now she has to pay the price.",
        "Sally: I've never been more sorry.",
        "Thomas: Wouldn't that be great, if sorry kicked in before the fact instead of after?",
        "Sally: Yeah. Yeah, that's what should have happened. I should have listened to what my heart was trying so hard to tell me.",
        "Thomas: Instead, you went with your survival instinct.",
        "Sally: And I disappointed you. And I regret that, Thomas. None of what spectra gained is worth the look in your eyes. I thought a successful relaunch was the most important thing in the world, but what I learned... I already found something much more valuable.",
        "R.J.: Did I miss something? I thought you were gonna tell Sally you were gonna make a statement to the cops. How did that turn into her confessing?",
        "Coco: I kind of went off on her with how disappointed I was that she ripped off Forrester creations instead of sticking to the original plan like, spectra was supposed to come back legit, and then Sally decided to take the spectra way out and used me to steal from you. But I just -- I think I was a little too harsh on her.",
        "R.J.: No, I'm -- I'm sure Sally understood where you were coming from.",
        "Coco: Yeah, I told her that I wasn't gonna compromise my own values like she had and that I would testify against her. Because it's the right thing to do, and she was really stunned. I don't think she knew the charges that she was facing. Like prison. But then the minute that she made the connection, like, she told me that she'd take care of it, and obviously you know the rest. [Sighs] Grams. Grams. I have to tell Grams.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Shirley: Oh! Hey, sweetheart. You busy? Saul and I could use a little help filling these orders.",
        "Coco: Well, you might as well stop. Sally and I are at Forrester creations.",
        "Shirley: Oh, well, I wondered where she got to.",
        "Coco: Okay, grams, listen. Sally turned herself in.",
        "Shirley: What?",
        "Coco: She admitted everything. And I don't know what the next step is, but I know she's in big trouble, and I'll just have to keep you posted, okay?",
        "Shirley: Coco, wait!",
        "Coco: [Breathing shakily]",
        "R.J.: It's okay. It's okay.",
        "Lt. Baker: What are they doing in there?",
        "Carter: It really hasn't been that long.",
        "Lt. Baker: It's been long enough. Time to wrap this up.",
        "Pam: You know, lieutenant, I thought this might take a minute, so I just took the liberty of texting one of our interns and asking her to bring up another hot dog for you.",
        "Lt. Baker: Oh, you did?",
        "Pam: Yes, with the homemade curry ginger mustard that you like so much.",
        "Lt. Baker: Why, thank you, ms. Douglas. That was --",
        "Pam: It's the least I can do for one of our city's finest.",
        "Lt. Baker: [Chuckles] [Sighs] So, are you still determined to put this woman behind bars?",
        "Steffy: You don't think I should?",
        "Lt baker: It's not my call.",
        "Steffy: I take no pleasure in the thought of Sally in prison.",
        "Carter: You don't have to go through with it, Steffy.",
        "Steffy: No, I do. If we allow Sally to get away with stealing our designs, it's open season for ourselves. Steal from Forrester, we just sit back and let it happen. Sally crossed the legal line, and we need to respond accordingly.",
        "Sally: [Sighs] Is there any way to make you understand? I'm not talking about any lame excuses because what I did was inexcusable, but just an explanation why.",
        "Thomas: I'd love to hear it. 'Cause, honestly, I'm at a loss.",
        "Sally: I got caught up. [Scoffs] Look, you don't know my family. They're relentless. My Grams with the in-your-face and my aunt Sally with her velvet glove. I just -- there was so much pressure to get spectra back in the game. \"No one can do it buy you, Sally. Everyone is counting on you, Sally. The future is in your hands.\" I just -- I didn't want to let anyone down. I had all these people counting on me, but I wanted to do it right. With original designs, my designs. A company rebuilt on my image and my vision.",
        "Thomas: I know.",
        "Sally: [Scoffs] But Jarrett's review threw me. It made me doubt myself. And grams, she just would not let up. \"We have to keep moving forward. We have to go back to our old ways and get spectra out of debt so that we can start helping our people -- Saul and Darlita, who have been so loyal since the beginning for little to no money. They deserve a return.\" So, when grams came up with the idea of using coco to come in here and get Forrester designs...",
        "Thomas: You just went along with it.",
        "Sally: You make -- you make it sound so easy. It was not easy. I had a lot of misgivings -- the thought of using my sister, the thought of betraying you and your family after you guys have been so nice to me.",
        "Thomas: But in the end, that's exactly what you did. Damn it, Sally. I loved you. I would have been happy to help you with anything if you had just asked. If you had trusted me the way that I trusted you. I believed in you. I believed in your talent and your designs and your goals and your ambition. All you had to do was reach out. But you didn't. Instead, you lied. And you stole from me. And my family. How could you do that?",
        "Saul: No, no, no, no, no. Don't tell me this. It can't be true.",
        "Shirley: Saul, I don't want to believe it, either, but there's no way around it. Sally just marched her big mouth over to Forrester and confessed to everything.",
        "Saul: But to grand larceny?",
        "Shirley: I guess, if that's what it is.",
        "Saul: God!",
        "Shirley: Oh, Saul, how could she? All these beautiful orders.",
        "Saul: Oh, forget about that, Shirley! What is gonna happen to Sal?",
        "Lt. Baker: Oh, that smells delicious. [Chuckles] Like nothing else in the world.",
        "Pam: My pleasure, lieutenant.",
        "Lt. Baker: Mmm!",
        "Carter: [Sighs] Not easy being boss, huh?",
        "Steffy: You think we're doing the right thing?",
        "Carter: From a business standpoint... no doubt.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Coco: Hey, Steffy.",
        "Steffy: Yeah?",
        "Coco: Look, I'll understand if you shut me down, but there's just some things that I feel like I need to say.",
        "Steffy: Yeah. Of course.",
        "Coco: My sister is a good person. Is she perfect? No. No, not even close. But she's been there for me for my whole life. So I went to Sally and I told her that I would have to give a statement against her. And she saw that it was killing me. So she just decided to confess. And I'm not saying that erases the fact that she stole from you. I'm not saying that at all. I guess what I'm trying to say is that... my sister does have a conscience, okay? She's not this calculating, thieving horrible person. And Sally did wrong and she knows that. It was an awful decision and a terrible mistake, but please -- just please don't send my sister to prison.",
        "Steffy: [Sighs] It's obvious how much you care about Sally. I get it. I feel the same way about my brother. But none of that changes anything. She broke the law, and there are consequences. Thomas.",
        "Thomas: Just a few more minutes. Please, Stef. Please.",
        "Steffy: Okay.",
        "Sally: Well, I, uh, guess this is it, where you say \"it was really nice knowing you,\" except for I'm sure you don't feel that way anymore.",
        "Thomas: Sally, I don't know what --",
        "Sally: It's cool. It's fine. Really. Whatever happens, I brought it on myself. You're looking at the world's biggest fool because I knew better and I let my grams get to my head. I betrayed the two people that I care about most. I sent my sister in here to steal designs without her knowledge or consent and jeopardized her job and the first real relationship that she has ever had. What kind of sister am I? Then there's you and what I did to you and your family.",
        "Thomas: Didn't have to be this way. I know you felt like you were drowning, and you had all this pressure on you to get the company back up and running, but I'll never understand why you didn't trust me enough to just come and ask me for help.",
        "Sally: I told you who I am.",
        "Thomas: [Sighs]",
        "Sally: I am a spectra. I am descended from a long line of cons and grifters. Lying and stealing, it is in my blood. I don't know, and maybe it's time that I start to embrace that inner spectra and stop fooling myself into thinking that I am better. Why? Because I'm talented? No. Jarrett schooled me on just how talented I actually am. He called it like it is. I am a joke. And now I'm a criminal. Headed off to prison. But just so you know, I'm -- I'm stopping production on all of your designs. I'm gonna call the buyers and tell them that we can't fill their orders. I will make this go away as much as I possibly can. We will go farther into debt and we'll have to close our doors, but you know what? I'm gonna do what I can to make this right. But in the meantime... we'll always have Australia. [Laughs] And I'll never forget it, Thomas. The way we laughed, and the way you kissed me. All the wonderful things that you said and how you believed in me. If anyone is handed all of that and still manages to screw it up, they did not deserve it in the first place. [Sniffles] I'm no good, Thomas. So just do yourself a favor. Don't walk. Run.",
        "Steffy: [Sighs] I wish Sally hadn't put us in this position where we have no choice but to take a hard line. We really had a moment. At least -- at least I thought so.",
        "Carter: You and Sally?",
        "Steffy: Yeah. She was genuine, and I finally saw how my brother could be so taken by her. You know, that Sally I don't want to go to prison, but this Sally, the woman who just turns around and steals from us? She gets what she asked for.",
        "R.J.: I am so sorry this is happening.",
        "Coco: Yeah, I -- I really can't believe it. My sister could go to prison. Please, Steffy. Please reconsider. There must be some kind of compromise. Look, you could sue Sally for civil damages and just take all the money, take the building, and you'll end spectra fashions for good. Just please don't send my sister to prison.",
        "Thomas: You can't order me to walk away any more than you can order me to stay right here.",
        "Sally: You can't stay or go if I'm locked up. I mean, I guess you could visit, but I don't know why you would want to do that.",
        "Thomas: All right, calm down. You're not in prison yet.",
        "Sally: I don't care if I go.",
        "Thomas: Because you're gonna fit in so well with the other inmates.",
        "Sally: I will do what it takes to survive. I'm no shrinking violet. You know that. I will just roll up my sleeves and I will come out swinging, and sooner or later, everyone will know not to mess with Sally spectra.",
        "Thomas: Is it weird that I could see that?",
        "Sally: I'm going where I belong. With people who think like me. But I want you to know something. I'm ashamed. And so very sorry. You and I had a big, beautiful, wonderful, glorious shot, and I threw it all away, and I should go to prison for that alone. So, let's get the ball rolling. Why don't you call the lieutenant in here and tell him I'm ready?",
        "Lt. Baker: We doing this?",
        "Steffy: Yes, we are. We're pressing charges. Arrest her.",
        "Coco: No, wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait!",
        "Sally: I'm so sorry. I love you, pumpkin.",
        "Coco: I love you so, so much.",
        "Thomas: Come on, man. The cuffs, really?",
        "Lt. Baker: Just till I get her to the station. Turn around, please."
