        "Marina: How about that place on willow street? It sounded pretty swanky.",
        "Danny: Willow? Wait, let me see? This one: \"Cozy with character\"? Come one, we can figured out what that means. It means tiny and needs a lot of work. No thanks. Don't you have to go to court soon anyway?",
        "Marina: I've got time.",
        "Danny: Let's get something to eat instead.",
        "Marina: Okay. You know, that place on 4th didn't sound so bad. It had exposed brick, great kitchen and I know guy would come down at least a hundred bucks.",
        "Danny: There's no backyard for robbie.",
        "Marina: The park's down the street.",
        "Danny: He needs a yard.",
        "Marina: You're dragging your feet, santos.",
        "Danny: No, I'm not. I'm just trying to find the right place.",
        "Marina: Face it, danny, nothing's going to live up to the house that you had with michelle.",
        "Tony: That's the last of them. Have some fun.",
        "Michelle: Where do you think you're going?",
        "Tony: I was thinking about going to watch tv. That's what I was going to do.",
        "Michelle: Oh, really? Going to leave me in my hour of need?",
        "Tony: I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I'm glad you're here.",
        "Michelle: Me, too.",
        "Tony: Yeah? Let me put these upstairs, okay?",
        "Michelle: What?",
        "Tony: Well, you know, nothing. I was just... are you sure you're okay with all of this?",
        "Michelle: Yes, of course i am.",
        "Tony: I just think that maybe we should... I don't know, find our own place to live because i know you hate this house.",
        "Michelle: Tony, tony. Look, it wasn't the house that freaked me out, okay? It was danny, you know? And I was overwhelmed and confused.",
        "Tony: Okay. But you guys had a life here.",
        "Michelle: Yeah, we did. We did. And now...",
        "Tony: What?",
        "Michelle: I'm going to have a new life with you.",
        "Tony: You are, huh?",
        "Olivia: Have you ever testified in court before?",
        "Bill: Well, one time I was in traffic court, saved myself 60 bucks. It's a little different, i guess, huh?",
        "Olivia: Yeah, I guess so.",
        "Bill: I just hate that they want me to get up there and ruin harley's case.",
        "Olivia: Look, the only way you can get through this is just to stick to the facts.",
        "Bill: You mean instead of helping out a friend?",
        "Olivia: Depends on what you mean by help.",
        "Bill: I don't want to get up there and say something stupid.",
        "Olivia: I heard you offer to lie for her.",
        "Bill: I never offered to lie.",
        "Olivia: If you try to get up there and do something clever to help her, you're not only putting her at risk, but alan is going to come after you and me and emma.",
        "Bill: All right. Listen to me. Don't worry. Yeah, I want to help out harley, but my family comes first. You and emma are a priority.",
        "Gus: Hi. Oh, my god.",
        "Harley: I'm awake.",
        "Gus: What time is it?",
        "Harley: What?",
        "Gus: You weren't supposed to let me sleep this late. It was supposed to be a nap and now... oh, my god.",
        "Harley: It's not that late.",
        "Gus: Yes, I am because I'm supposed to cross-examine bill lewis.",
        "Harley: Can we stay here for one minute?",
        "Gus: No.",
        "Harley: Please? One minute! Please? Can we just pretend for one minute that you are not trying to save my life and throwing away yours?",
        "Michelle: You know, danny tried to make me feel comfortable here, he did. He did, but, you know, it just didn't work.",
        "Tony: Well, how do you feel now?",
        "Michelle: Like this is my home. Like it's robbie's home, too. And you've given him back this really great house.",
        "Tony: This is a great house for a kid. Plenty of places to play hide and seek.",
        "Michelle: Robbie used to love to slide back and forth in his socks in the upstairs hallway. I mean, he would have done it for hours if we had let the kid. He really loved it here. Hey, thank you. Thank you so much.",
        "Tony: You don't have to thank me, baby, okay? You don'T. I want us all to be together. Your little nose is cold.",
        "Michelle: Well, it's cold in here. Why don't you make me a fire.",
        "Tony: Can't do it, the valve is stuck.",
        "Michelle: Oh, I can fix that. Danny showed me how?",
        "Tony: Oh, he did, huh? When? You lived here during the summer so that's kind of weird.",
        "Michelle: I don't know. You know, maybe he...",
        "Tony: You remembered something, did you?",
        "Michelle: I'm not sure. He probably mentioned it to me, you know?",
        "Tony: Sure. Maybe.",
        "Michelle: I've got to go pick up robbie.",
        "Tony: I'll get him, stay here and fix the flue.",
        "Michelle: Oh, the truth comes out. You moved me in here because I'm handy, right?",
        "Tony: You caught me. See 'ya.",
        "Michelle: How did I remember this?",
        "Rick: It's freezing out there. Hey.",
        "Michelle: Hi.",
        "Rick: Tony told me you were in here.",
        "Michelle: What's that?",
        "Rick: Just some stuff robbie left at the house.",
        "Michelle: Thanks. Thanks for bringing it by.",
        "Rick: So moving in, huh?",
        "Michelle: Yup.",

        "Michelle: You know, it's okay. Really.",
        "Rick: So what's going on with you?",
        "Michelle: Nothing. Nothing. You know, just moving in and everything is a little overwhelming. That's all.",
        "Rick: You've had some memories. You have had more memories. It's starting to come back to you, isn't it?",
        "Michelle: No, it's not.",
        "Danny: Hey, me finding a place or not finding a place has nothing to do with michelle.",
        "Marina: Okay. I just know how much you love that house.",
        "Danny: Michelle loved that house. I just bought it for her.",
        "Marina: Uh-huh.",
        "Danny: Look, my life with michelle is over. Okay, does a part of me miss it? Yes.",
        "Marina: Which part?",
        "Danny: Which part of me misses it or which part do i miss?",
        "Marina: You tell me.",
        "Danny: You're so strange.",
        "Marina: Oh, but you love it! Danny, it's okay to admit this is hard. You've lost a lot.",
        "Danny: You know what? I think I am going to take a look at that place on 4th, check it out.",
        "Marina: Okay, let's go.",
        "Danny: No, you go to court and if the place deserves a second viewing, I'll take you over there tomorrow, okay?",
        "Marina: Okay.",
        "Danny: Come here. Thanks.",
        "Marina: For what?",

        "Marina: Way to go, big mouth.",
        "Danny: Hey, lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: Hi.",
        "Danny: Hey, um... I read about what happened in court yesterday and for what it's worth, I know how it feels to be falsely accused.",
        "Lizzie: Why don't you save that, danny. I know you're a cooper sympathizer.",
        "Alan: Elizabeth, why aren't you dressed for court?",
        "Lizzie: I'm not going to court.",
        "Alan: Well, I think it's very important that the jury seize the family unified.",
        "Lizzie: Gus has already messed that up.",
        "Alan: Well, that's true, but I would appreciate if...",
        "Lizzie: No! Granddad, I'm not going. I'm not going now, I'm not going ever to court.",
        "Alan: Okay: All right. You don't have to go.",
        "Lizzie: I don't have to do anything that I don't want to. Hi, you know what? We're closing early today. If you could please just get out now. Hi, I'm sorry. The food's on the house, but i have to close, sorry. I'm so sorry, really. All right, hurry up. Quickly.",
        "Harley: You should have told me about the disbarment hearing. I know all about it.",
        "Gus: It's not that big a deal.",
        "Harley: It is a big deal! I can't stand what is happening to you because of me. I'm hiring myself another lawyer.",
        "Gus: Stop trying to fire me constantly, okay? I nigh you seemed taller.",
        "Harley: Look, I'm going to prison, okay? I am going to prison.",
        "Gus: I'm not going to be disbarred and you're not going to prison so please. I need you to be positive. I need positivity around me like a good aura while I go in and do this thing.",
        "Harley: You are the most pig headed man I've ever met in my life. Don't you get it? You are going to lose everything because of me.",
        "Gus: Don't you get it, i don't want to be in this world unless you're next to me. I've got to go take a shower.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay. Are you ready?",
        "Bill: Yeah. Can't wait to sell my friend down the river.",
        "Jeffrey: I don't like this anymore than you do. But if you were the victim's family, you'd want justice, too, wouldn't you?",
        "Bill: This is not justice; this is a farce.",
        "Jeffrey: All right. Just answer the questions, okay, and we won't have any problems.",
        "Bill: Okay.",
        "Olivia: I know you're frustrated but you're going to have to deal with it.",
        "Bill: I'm dealing with it.",
        "Olivia: No, I mean it. If you get up on that witness stand and...",
        "Bill: I need some water.",
        "Alan: Well, bill, are you ready to do your part for justice?",
        "Michelle: You know, ever since I woke up from the accident, everybody's just waiting for me to have this giant breakthrough, and it's a lot of pressure.",
        "Rick: Michelle, I'm sorry. But the idea of you getting your memory back is so exciting to me, it's easy to forget how overwhelming this is for you and I'm sorry about that.",
        "Michelle: Don't be. But I can't live my life waiting for that to happen, you know?",
        "Rick: Michelle, it's happening.",
        "Michelle: It's just little pieces here and there. And, really, I'm happy with making new memories.",
        "Rick: Well, the bottom line is, I just want you to be happy, that's all.",
        "Michelle: And I want the same for you. So how is everything going?",
        "Rick: Well, it's getting a little better everyday, just a little bit.",
        "Michelle: Everything?",
        "Rick: I hope so.",
        "Michelle: Look, you know, if you need anything....",
        "Rick: Hey, who's the big brother around here?",
        "Michelle: Little sisters aren't good for nothing?",
        "Rick: I'll think about it and get back to you.",
        "Michelle: You're such a bonehead, I swear.",
        "Rick: Michelle, you used to call me bonehead all the time.",
        "Michelle: Okay. I called you a bonehead because you are one, not because of a memory.",
        "Rick: That's my sister, always so sweet and thoughtful.",
        "Michelle: Yeah.",
        "Rick: Look, I've got to go to the courthouse. I'll see you later. Thanks for this, by the way, I'll take that with me.",
        "Michelle: Oh, yeah. Uh-huh. No problem. ( Knock on door )",
        "Tony: I'm going to score on you. Get to the goal and let's see if I can score on you, okay? Here we go, ready? Oh, you stopped it. Okay, let's do it one more time. I'll bet you I score this time. Good kick. All right, dribbling, dribbling. Yeah, tony scores!",

        "Danny: Where's michelle?",
        "Tony: She had some things to do.",

        "Tammy: Open the door.",
        "Lizzie: No!",

        "Lizzie: I'm spending time with my daddy.",
        "Alan: You know, bill, i couldn't help but overhear the D.A. Tell you to behave yourself on the stand.",
        "Bill: No need to be warned, alan, I plan on telling the truth so help me.",
        "Alan: Well, that's very wise of you because no good will come of you sacrificing yourself for harley. Harley's going down and there's nothing you or anyone else can do about it.",
        "Bill: You think?",
        "Alan: Oh, I know. Why go down with her? The only person you would hurt is yourself and olivia.",
        "Harley: Hey, um... I... i don't want to go in there just yet, okay?",
        "Gus: Well, don't be long.",
        "Jeffrey: Here, I need you to take care of this right away. Thank you. You know, you really do need to take the plea deal, terrier, as much as I wish it wasn't, this case is airtight.",
        "Bill: What was that all about?",
        "Harley: Well, he says that we shouldn't be talking. I think that goes for us, too.",
        "Bill: We talk all the time. At least we used to.",
        "Harley: Did you listen to a word I said the other day?",
        "Bill: I don't know. What'd you say?",
        "Harley: You know what I said. I don't want you doing anything silly up on the stand today, okay?",
        "Bill: Something silly? Come on, that hurts.",
        "Harley: I'm serious.",
        "Bill: You don't think I know that. Look, if I can help...",
        "Harley: You can'T. Just tell the truth, okay?",
        "Alan: I don't know what you did, olivia, but good work.",
        "Olivia: I didn't do anything. Bill knows that emma and I are counting on him and he's going to do the right thing.",
        "Alan: Well I hope so for your your sake. Because I won't be a happy boss if I don't get what I want.",
        "Baliff: All right, court is now in order. The on rabble judge ellis now presided.",
        "Judge: Be seated. Mr. O'neill, you may call your next witness.",

        "Olivia: Coming up on \"guiding light\"...",
        "Tony: I am sorry everyone's got to pay for it.",
        "Danny: Tony, I don't see you paying for one thing.",
        "Danny: Really? Tell me.",
        "Tony: I lost my best friend, danny. That's a big enough price to pay don't you think?",
        "Bill: I guess you remember things one way and I remember them another.",
        "Harley: Really? Well, how will olivia remembered them?",
        "Bill: She'll remember it the right way.",
        "Danny: Put this on you okay, go ahead. Go ahead.",
        "Tony: Have fun, buddy.",
        "Danny: So you and michelle are going to be living together?",
        "Tony: Yeah, it looks that way. You got a problem with that? I mean...",
        "Danny: Just concerned about my son, tony?",
        "Tony: Look, danny, I love the kid, too, okay?",
        "Danny: I know you do.",
        "Tony: And you also know i would never do anything to hurt robbie.",
        "Danny: Not intentionally, tony, no. But did you stop to think about robbie's feelings when you and michelle were planing this big move.",
        "Tony: It's not a big move, danny. The house is great, it's perfect he loves it there.",
        "Danny: But he's used to living with his mom and dad and now uncle tony will be there instead of me. Don't you think that might be a little confusing for him?",
        "Tony: Okay. What if we explain it to him.",
        "Danny: He's four years old. What's he going to understand?",
        "Tony: He's a lot smarter than you give him credit for.",
        "Danny: I know my own son, danny.",
        "Tony: What is it with you? You act like you never made a mistake, like you're the parent of the year, here?",
        "Danny: Compared to you and michelle.",
        "Tony: There it is again, putting down tony.",
        "Danny: You brought this on yourself.",
        "Tony: No, danny, you did, when you set off the bomb. Look, look, danny, I it that way things out, okay?",
        "Danny: But you're not sorry they turned out this way.",
        "Tony: No, I'm not. But I'm sorry everyone's got to pay for it.",
        "Danny: Tony, I don't see you paying for one damn thing.",
        "Tony: You wouldn'T.",
        "Danny: Really. Then tell me.",
        "Tony: I lost my best friend, danny. That's a big enough price to pay don't you think?",
        "Marina: Is tony here?",
        "Michelle: Hello to you, too, marina?",
        "Marina: I'm sorry, I just didn't expect you to answer the door.",

        "Michelle: Yeah, moving in. Do you want to hang out?",

        "Marina: No, danny and I...",
        "Michelle: Okay. Sorry, sorry. You like him a lot, right?",
        "Marina: Look, can we not talk about this?",
        "Michelle: Makes you uncomfortable?",
        "Marina: A little.",
        "Michelle: Okay. Oh, you know, I found all these pictures of me and you and march A. I think they were from the bower barbecue or something like that. You want to see them.",
        "Marina: Sure.",
        "Michelle: I think they're somewhere in here. One of these boxes.",
        "Marina: You threw this away. Danny's your son's father.",
        "Michelle: I don't hate danny, okay?",
        "Marina: Yeah? Well you could have fool me.",
        "Michelle: Marina, I didn't throw it away because I hate danny. I threw it away because I really don't want to... I don't want it bringing back anymore memories of him.",

        "Bill: Sort of?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, we went in business together to bring down spaulding.",
        "Jeffrey: Phillip spaulding?",
        "Bill: No, his company. See, it was one of the goals of my company to prevent spaulding from taking over springfield. In fact, I have a document right here that will even....",
        "Judge: Mr. Lewis, it's not your responsibility to introduce evidence into this court.",
        "Bill: Sorry. I just thought....",
        "Judge: Mr. O'neill?",
        "Jeffrey: Thank you, your honor. Mr. Lewis, do you consider yourself a friend of the defendant?",
        "Bill: Yes.",
        "Jeffrey: As a friend, would you say that the defendant became obsessed with taking down philip spaulding?",
        "Bill: No, not at all.",
        "Jeffrey: Not at all? Yet she created this whole alternate personality to get closer to phillip?",
        "Bill: Ruth?",
        "Jeffrey: That's right, ruth karloff.",
        "Bill: No, that was me. That was my idea.",
        "Jeffrey: Mr. Lewis, are you lying to the court to protect your friend?",
        "Bill: Mr. O'neill, I'm not lying at all. In fact, I have a sketch right here of what she was supposed to look like early on.",
        "Judge: Mr. Lewis...",
        "Bill: In fact, I even have the glasses I was going to wear because I was the one who was going to go undercover. It was all me. Excuse me, mr. Oh neil, you look quite well. Mr. Spaulding, I...",
        "Judge: Baliff, seize those items.",
        "Bill: One crumpet, that's all I ask for.",
        "Judge: Mr. Lewis, one more stunt like that and I'd hold you in contempt of court.",
        "Bill: I'm sorry, your honor. I thought if there was a visual aid for the people...",
        "Jeffrey: It's all right, your honor. I have one more questmon for mr. Lewis. Bill, were you aware that your friend harley disguised herself as ruth karloff the night that philip spaulding was murdered? Bill:, No, but I...",
        "Jeffrey: It would be safe to say harley could have developed an obsession with philip and you didn't know about it.",
        "Gus: He's leading the witness.",
        "Jeffrey: I withdraw. No further questions, your honor.",
        "Judge: Mr. Aitoro?",
        "Gus: Mr. Lewis, the prosecution would like us to believe that miss cooper is a blood thirsty ex-wife was obsessed with her ex-husband, phillip spaulding. Are you saying that that is not true?",
        "Bill: That is not true. It's not. Like I said, I came up with the identity, I gave contacts. It was me. It was all me. In fact, she was feeling vulnerable and I took advantage of that.",
        "Gus: So let me get this straight: The scam to get philip spaulding, this was your idea and your's alone?",
        "Bill: Yes, yes, it was. In fact, harley was quite reluctant to do it.",
        "Gus: I see. And are there any witnesses to her reluctance?",
        "Bill: Yes. Yes. My wife. Olivia spencer lewis.",
        "Michelle: See, marina, I'm happy with the way my life is now and I just don't need the look back.",

        "Marina: Okay.",
        "Michelle: I don't know why this is so hard for you to understand. I have tony and danny has you.",
        "Marina: Michelle, I told you...",
        "Michelle: Right, right. You told me. You told me. But you're obviously in love with him. Otherwise, you wouldn't be here.",

        "Harley: Are you nuts?",
        "Bill: I gave my version of the truth.",
        "Harley: Because I was so reluctant to put on that wig and that fake nose.",

        "Bill: She'll remember it the right way.",

        "Gus: Hmm, why would I do that?",
