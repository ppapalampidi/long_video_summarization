        "Cassie: I can't do this. I'm sorry. I can't do this. I have to go to the fertility clinic tomorrow, edmund.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, that doesn't mean that...",
        "Cassie: There's so many things that I've got to take care of. The retrieval is tomorrow. Tomorrow. So I'm going to have to make other arrangements for the kids, I'm going to have to call the beacon, and I'm going to have to reschedule everything, and then I have so many errands to run... and the recycling.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, that doesn't mean we can'T...",
        "Cassie: Do you know the recycling tomorrow is due?",
        "Edmund: Look, cassie, wait. Here, let me take that for you.",
        "Cassie: I got it. Just open the door. Just get the door.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, the doctor said...",
        "Cassie: Oh, gosh.",
        "Edmund: ...You need to avoid stress and fatigue, so I don't think you... there are very few things in the world that matter more to me than this. And I want you to have it. He was here.",
        "Cassie: Who?",
        "Edmund: Jonathan. I reach out to him, and he spits in my face.",
        "Jonathan: The word on the street is that aunt cassie's barn almost burned down because of uncle edmund.",
        "Reva: No. Cassie and rj were almost killed in that fire.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah.",
        "Reva: Edmund started the fire? But why?",
        "Jonathan: Okay. Whatever.",
        "Reva: No. Look, I know you hate edmund. You've got every reason to. But to accuse him of something like that is insane.",
        "Jonathan: Look, I'm just saying what I heard.",
        "Reva: From who?",
        "Jonathan: Somebody who saw the whole incident from spark to blaze.",
        "Reva: But why? Why would he do that?",
        "Jonathan: Well, jealousy eating at your guts can turn you into a monster, especially when you're a monster to begin with.",
        "Reva: Jealousy. But who... who was he jealous of?",
        "Jonathan: ( Laughs ) dad's stunt double.",
        "Reva: Jeffrey o'neill?",
        "Jonathan: Mm-hmm. From what I heard, uncle edmund was really out to get that guy.",
        "Reva: Jeffrey was at the farm that day, and he was hurt. Something fell on him.",
        "Jonathan: Or smacked into him.",
        "Reva: What do you mean?",
        "Jonathan: Well, I'm not saying that uncle eddie set out to start the fire in the barn, but I am saying that he was looking to kill daddy's double.",
        "Dinah: Of course. \"Leave a message.\" Jonathan? Dinah. Hi. Just got a call from my ob/gyn admirer corey, with this following news flash: Cassie is headed to cedars tomorrow for the first step of in vitro fertilization, which means whatever you've been doing to bust up cassie and edmund, it's not enough.",
        "Ross: Dinah?",
        "Dinah: Daddy. Hi.",
        "Ross: Is something wrong?",
        "Dinah: No. I'm just trying to wrap up an annoying little bit of business. But I want to go in and show the flag for harley, but you know what? Maybe I ought to take care of... of this problem in person.",
        "Ross: Dinah? What business could be more important than supporting an old friend when she needs it the most? Come on. Let's go in.",
        "Judge ellis: Order!",
        "Alan: This is outrageous, gus. You can't sacrifice your own niece with these lies.",
        "Judge ellis: Sit down immediately, or I will find you in contempt.",
        "Harley: Do you know what you're doing?",
        "Alan: Your honor, you've got to do something.",
        "Judge ellis: Order, or I'll find you in contempt. Sit down, mr. Spaulding. Right now.",
        "Jeffrey: Mr. Spaulding is right, your honor. The witness is not on trial here.",
        "Gus: Your honor, lizzie spaulding was at the scene of the crime the night her father was gunned down. I'm simply trying to establish what and how much she knows about this murder.",
        "Judge ellis: Proceed, but tread carefully. Is that understood?",
        "Gus: Yes.",
        "Judge ellis: Good.",
        "Gus: Thank you.",
        "Harley: Gus.",
        "Gus: I don't care. Lizzie, shortly before your father was killed, he abducted three of your siblings, didn't he? James, zach, and emma, along with harley cooper's other son, jude. Is that right?",
        "Lizzie: Daddy wasn't himself.",
        "Gus: He wasn't himself.[(H\u00ed/-ko\u00d14at firsthand because he was going to take you along with them as well, wasn't he?",
        "Lizzie: Yes.",
        "Gus: And how did that make you feel?",
        "Lizzie: I hated it.",
        "Gus: Did you hate it enough to kill him?",
        "Sandy: No problem, no problem. ( Telephone ringing ) you're welcome. Lewis construction. Billy. Billy, yes, everything is... i was on the other line with carpenter and morrison. You know how they are. No, I have the papers right here. They are... no, hold on a second. Um, they're right... sorry, sorry. Yeah, no, I'm good. Everything's good. You know what? I have them right here. We're all set. No, I've got everything under control. Fine. Bye, billy.",
        "Tammy: Here.",
        "Sandy: Okay, so... sorry.",
        "Tammy: Yeah. You know, I'm going to talk to my uncle josh, because he is not paying you enough.",
        "Sandy: Yeah, not today he's not. Okay. Wham, everything at once when i came here this morning, and it's been like this all day.",
        "Tammy: Where's wanda?",
        "Sandy: Wanda. Vacation. Yeah, and where are josh and billy? Oh, jeez, off dealing with whatever. It's all about me right now. What's up with you, tammy?",
        "Tammy: Well, I don't have a late class today, so I thought you could give me a ride home. My car is still in the shop. So what time are you finished?",
        "Sandy: I don't know. I have about four or five hours of work ahead of me.",
        "Tammy: Are you kidding me?",
        "Sandy: I wish.",
        "Tammy: Okay. Well, how about this? I will stay here and help you in the office, and when you're caught up, you can give me a ride?",
        "Sandy: Are you volunteering for mundane office chores?",
        "Tammy: Hey, I am all about chores. So what's first on the list?",
        "Sandy: How about a little backrub? I'm kidding, I'm kidding. File those alphabetically in the cabinet, bottom drawer.",
        "Tammy: At your service, sir.",
        "Edmund: This is not acceptable.",
        "Cassie: Edmund, it's fine. It's fine.",
        "Edmund: No, cassie, it's not fine. This is his calling card. He's not finished with us.",
        "Cassie: Well maybe... maybe it's a mistake. Maybe he came by here to say thank you, and he accidentally dropped it outside.",
        "Edmund: No, cassie. The war for him is not over. And if he wants war, I'm going to give him a war.",
        "Cassie: You have to stop looking for jonathan before something...",
        "Edmund: Before... before what? Before I kill him?",
        "Cassie: I wasn't going to say that. Hey, come on. Edmund, do you think that I want to have a baby with a man who is a time bomb waiting to go off?",
        "Edmund: Of course you don't, cassie. Of course. I'm sorry.",
        "Cassie: Look, I love you. I love you, and I have complete faith in you. What, you don't believe that?",
        "Edmund: Cassie, I want to. I really do. But you found me about to smash the kid's skull in. I mean, that had to be...",
        "Cassie: Scary? It was. But you know what was really scary? It was the thought of jonathan getting to you and telling you his side of the story about what happened the night before our wedding. That scared me, edmund. But you know what? That's all behind us now. It's in the past. And no one can hurt us anymore.",
        "Jonathan: Edmund smacks jeffrey with the shovel, jeffrey goes down, drops his lantern, fire starts.",
        "Reva: If you want me to believe you, then you're going to have to tell me where you got your information.",
        "Jonathan: I'm not at liberty to divulge...",
        "Reva: Do you think this is a game? My sister and my nephew were nearly killed in that fire. Now, tell me what you know.",
        "Jonathan: Well, you should understand about protecting your sources.",
        "Reva: It can only be one of two people. Either jeffrey told you himself, or it was the person who rescued rj and told edmund that cassie was still in the barn. Dinah. Dinah marler. That's who it was. Am I right?",
        "Jonathan: You're the investigative reporter. You should understand that i can't divulge those facts.",
        "Reva: Yeah, well, everyone knows that a good investigative reporter always checks the credibility of her sources, and in cassie's case, dinah's got none.",
        "Jonathan: Well, call me crazy, but I believe the story.",
        "Reva: Because you want to.",
        "Jonathan: No, because it sounds right. Dinah's got this information that could blow up cassie's relationship and she doesn't use it. If she hates cassie so much, why?",
        "Reva: I don't know. I don't know what to think of any of this.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, I was going to sit on it, too, but you know what? A guy threatens your life, you start thinking maybe he's better off not around. Edmund hasn't changed. He picked up a wife and loses some of the violence, but somebody threatens him, his temper blows and he's ready to kill again, just like he used to.",
        "Reva: But edmund dragged jeffrey out of the barn.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, well maybe he had a touch of humanity, or... you know, more likely, he wanted to cover his tracks so he didn't lose cassie and end up in the slammer.",
        "Reva: I don't buy this.",
        "Jonathan: What?",
        "Reva: Jeffrey would have done something. He would have pressed charges.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, if he knew. He got clocked from behind.",
        "Reva: I can't believe this.",
        "Jonathan: You can't believe it, or you don't want to believe it? I think you're scared that edmund is still very much a threat to me, you, and cassie.",
        "Gus: What does it feel like for you to trust somebody, and then realize that your trust has been betrayed?",
        "Lizzie: You can never forgive them for that.",
        "Gus: Well, what can you do?",
        "Lizzie: Pretend like nothing's happening.",
        "Gus: Well, when do you stop doing that?",
        "Lizzie: When it's not just you anymore. When they start hurting other people, people that you really care about.",
        "Gus: And then you need to take an action, don't you?",
        "Lizzie: You have to make it stop.",
        "Gus: You're a spaulding. No one's going to hurt you or your family and get away with it. Isn't that right?",
        "Lizzie: No one.",
        "Gus: Do you fight back?",
        "Lizzie: Yes.",
        "Gus: There was a gun there, wasn't there, lizzie? There was a gun there that night.",
        "Lizzie: Yes.",
        "Gus: Did you pick it up?",
        "Lizzie: I really didn't want to. I tried to tell him that.",
        "Gus: Tell him what?",
        "Lizzie: I told him to stop, that it hurts. And I told him that he really needed to stop. I begged him.",
        "Gus: And he wouldn't?",
        "Lizzie: No.",
        "Gus: Is that when you pulled the trigger?",
        "Jeffrey: Objection, your honor!",
        "Gus: Is that when you fired the shots...",
        "Jeffrey: Objection!",
        "Judge ellis: Overruled.",
        "Gus: Answer the question, lizzie. Is that when you fired the shots that killed him? Is that when you fired the shots that killed him?",
        "Jeffrey: Objection.",
        "Judge ellis: Overruled.",
        "Gus: Answer the question. Is that when you fired the shots that killed him?",
        "Jeffrey: Objection.",
        "Judge ellis: Overruled.",
        "Gus: Answer the question, lizzie. Is that when you fired the shots that killed him?",
        "Jeffrey: Objection.",
        "Judge ellis: Overruled.",
        "Gus: Answer the question. Is that when you fired the shots that killed him?",
        "Jeffrey: Objection.",
        "Judge ellis: Overruled. ( Judge bangs gavel )",
        "Gus: Lizzie. Lizzie? Lizzie?",
        "Judge ellis: Bailiff, send for the emt.",
        "Gus: Come on, lizzie.",
        "Judge ellis: We'll take a short recess.",
        "Alan: Get away from her. Sweetheart? Sweetheart?",
        "Beth: Lizzie?",
        "Alan: Sweetheart, can you hear me?",
        "Beth: Sweetie.",
        "Coop: Harley, wait. Don'T. Look, let them handle it right now.",
        "Harley: What the hell is going on up there?",
        "Coop: I don't know. I don't know. All I know is that gus has said all along that he was going to go ahead and clear you of these charges, and that he would find the real killer. And if it happens to be lizzie, gus will get the truth out of it, okay?",
        "Harley: Yeah.",
        "Ross: Lizzie killed phillip? My god, could that be true?",
        "Dinah: Well, when your back's against the wall and there's no way out, you fight back. Everybody does.",
        "Alan: I don't want to talk to you.",
        "Gus: Listen, I know what you're thinking, that I threw lizzie to the wolves.",
        "Alan: Didn't you?",
        "Gus: No. She has got emotional problems, okay? Everybody in this town knows it. Jeffrey o'neill knows it. I'm sure he'll go easy on her during sentencing.",
        "Alan: Sentencing?",
        "Gus: If she comes clean, i will help her. I'll do whatever I can to make it less painful.",
        "Alan: I know what you're trying to do. You're trying to protect harley. Well, let me tell you something, those children are all I have left of phillip, and I will do anything in my power to protect them.",
        "Gus: The way you protected phillip?",
        "Beth: Jeffrey. You're not just going to let him get away with this, are you?",
        "Jeffrey: Gus is just doing what any lawyer in his position would do.",
        "Beth: So this is all just fine with you?",
        "Jeffrey: Beth, please.",
        "Beth: Is that...",
        "Jeffrey: Beth...",
        "Beth: Listen to me. She may look tough on the outside, but inside she is as fragile as glass, and if he keeps pounding away at her, she is going to shatter. Now, if that happens, who is going to pick up the pieces, huh? You?",
        "Coop: I'm sure if your dad were here, he'd want you to be strong, but I also know that he would also want you to fess up to what you did.",
        "Lizzie: What I did.",
        "Coop: Do you remember that night that I came in through your window to visit you? I found something in your room. I found a sliver of glass with some blood on it.",
        "Lizzie: Glass.",
        "Coop: Yeah. Lizzie, that's what we need you to talk about. All of it. Look, it's going to clear your conscience, and it's going to make you better off for it. We need you to talk about everything that you did.",
        "Tammy: I need to find a scene for my spring project. I was thinking something straightforward, like ibsen or williams, but I thought maybe you might have some ideas?",
        "Sandy: Uh...",
        "Tammy: Are you okay?",
        "Sandy: Yeah. Mm-hmm.",
        "Tammy: Well, don't slow down now. We're almost done.",
        "Sandy: Yes. Yes, ma'am.",
        "Tammy: Get to work.",
        "Sandy: Yes, ma'am. Wait, wait. I thought I was the boss here.",
        "Tammy: ( Scoffs ) that's what I let you think.",
        "Sandy: You are one dangerous woman to have in the office.",
        "Tammy: Excuse me?",
        "Sandy: Well, you almost stapled my finger twice, you threw a box on my head, and a guy just can't focus with you in the office.",
        "Tammy: And yet we're almost finished. And, you know, I want more than a ride home for all this hard work.",
        "Sandy: Oh, do you?",
        "Tammy: Food, sandy.",
        "Sandy: Oh.",
        "Tammy: Uh-huh. And I am not cooking.",
        "Sandy: Oh, you know what? I can call towers, see if they can squeeze us in.",
        "Tammy: No, no, that's okay. I'll go easy on you.",
        "Sandy: That would be a first.",
        "Tammy: Look, I'm just in the mood for something basic, okay? But are we finished or what?",
        "Sandy: Technically, no.",
        "Tammy: Come on, sandy. I am starving. It's time to pay the price for all my valuable assistance. Well? Think you can give me what i want?",
        "Cassie: Edmund, everything is okay. You know, you've got to let this go.",
        "Edmund: That's easier said than done, isn't it?",
        "Cassie: No, no. No, it's not, because there are so many wonderful things for us to think about besides jonathan. We're getting ready to have a baby.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, I haven't stopped thinking about that from the moment I found out it was even possible.",
        "Cassie: Me either. Me either. And you said a few minutes ago on that couch how lucky you felt. Well, I feel the same way.",
        "Edmund: You know, if jonathan had just accepted...",
        "Cassie: You've got to let this go, edmund.",
        "Edmund: It was a mistake even trying to talk to him.",
        "Cassie: No. It wasn'T.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, the next time someone tries to threaten this family, I'm going to handle it my own way.",
        "Cassie: I don't want anyone, above all jonathan, to make us so angry that we become obsessed with them, edmund. Look at me. We are the most important thing, you and me and our family.",
        "Edmund: That's what I'm trying to say. There is nothing more important than trying to protect it.",
        "Cassie: Well, then we're going to have to go about this another way. You obviously couldn't get through to jonathan. I think I know someone who can, maybe the only person who can. Reva.",
        "Jonathan: You've been expecting something like this out of uncle eddie, haven't you? You've been waiting for it.",
        "Reva: I wanted so much to believe in him, for cassie's sake, but I guess somewhere deep in the back of my mind, I've had my doubts.",
        "Jonathan: Well, now the doubts are in the front of your mind.",
        "Reva: Even if what you're telling me is true-- and it's still a huge \"if\"-- what can i do about it?",
        "Jonathan: You can tell cassie.",
        "Reva: And then what?",
        "Jonathan: I don't know. I mean, this is your call. But I honestly wonder if we're looking at a one-time thing or the beginning of a pattern. ( Telephone ringing ) oh, you might want to answer this one.",
        "Reva: Cassie.",
        "Jonathan: Perfect timing.",
        "Reva: Hello?",
        "Cassie: Hi. It's me.",
        "Reva: Hi. How are you?",
        "Cassie: I'm good. I... look, I know that things haven't been great between us, but I had to call you because... well, I have some news for you. Reva? Are you there?",
        "Reva: Yeah, I'm here. I've got some news for you, too. Coming up on \"guiding light\"...",
        "Jonathan: I took care of it.",
        "Dinah: Really?",
        "Jonathan: Mm-hmm.",
        "Dinah: How did you do that?",
        "Jonathan: The same way that you did. I gave you up.",
        "Gus: Because we all need to know the truth, lizzie, and you know what the truth is, don't you?",
        "Lizzie: The last night, it was just like he was a monster, and I hated him so much. I had to make him go away. Oprah: I've waited 51 years to",
        "Cassie: What is it?",
        "Reva: Well, I should probably tell you this in person, but then maybe it can't wait. Jonathan and I have been talking about some things that are very troubling.",
        "Cassie: Okay. What things?",
        "Reva: Things about you and edmund.",
        "Cassie: Reva, I called you not because I wanted to get back into things, but I need your help, okay?T( not your criticism.",
        "Reva: I'm trying to help you.",
        "Cassie: I find that hard to believe.",
        "Reva: You're not even listening to what I have to say, and you're still getting defensive.",
        "Cassie: Of course I'm defensive.Q every time I turn around, I have to defend myself and edmund to you because of your son.",
        "Reva: What about him? He's right here.\u00d1i",
        "Cassie: Listen, reva, tomorrow is a big day for me, and the fact that you're there with him is the...",
        "Edmund: Reva, hang up.",
        "Reva: Edmund? Is cassie all right?",
        "Edmund: No, she's not. She needs to remain stress-free, and you're making that quite impossible.",
        "Reva: Put my sister back on the phone.",
        "Edmund: Say hello to josh for us.",
        "Cassie: I can't believe you just did that.",
        "Edmund: I should never have let you dial her number in thej first place.",
        "Cassie: Edmund, I needed to talk to my sister.5a",
        "Edmund: Cassie, you need to be stress-free right now. Now, I apologize for being so abrupt with you and your sister, but from the moment you got on the phone with her, your stress level went from elevated to high, and that's not good.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, okay. Okay.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, just be happy you're married to a man who is about to take every detail of your life-- at least for the time being-- under control, whether you like it or not. Here.",
        "Cassie: You really want a baby, don't you?",
        "Edmund: Yes, I do.",
        "Cassie: So why don't you just wrap me in cotton wool and stick me in your pocket, if you're so worried about my well-being?",
        "Edmund: I wish I could. I've thought about it. Cassie, you know there's not anything I wouldn't do to keep you safe.",
        "Jonathan: Eddie hung up on you, huh? What was that about?",
        "Reva: He's trying to keep me away from my own sister.",
        "Lizzie: You have no idea what you've done.",
        "Coop: Lizzie, what are you talking about?",
        "Lizzie: Oh, my gosh, it's all back. It's all back now.",
        "Coop: What? What is back?",
        "Lizzie: I'm nothing like him. I'm nothing at all like him. I am not crazy.",
        "Beth: I hope you're proud of yourself. And you. I helped you. I lied to get you out of jail, and this is how you repay me?",
        "Harley: Beth, I hate this. Please. It seems like all her life lizzie has suffered through one thing after another.",
        "Beth: So, what? This is just more of the same for her? Is that it?",
        "Harley: I don't want to add to her problems.",
        "Beth: Then don'T. Do you remember what you said to me when you tracked me down in that spa? You admitted that you didn't know whether you had killed phillip or not.",
        "Harley: Yes, I remember.",
        "Beth: And you swore that you would find out the truth about what happened that night, even if it meant you were guilty.",
        "Harley: I still feel that way, beth.",
        "Harley: Yeah? Well, you're letting him pin the child that you well know has been through so much already. Oh, sure, she is the perfect target. Pin it on her. It's a brilliant strategy. You might even get off.Q I just hope you can live with yourself when you do.",
        "Alan: What the hell does gus have on elizabeth?",
        "Jeffrey: I don't know, alan. I'm working on it.",
        "Alan: Well, that's not good enough, because he is torturing my granddaughter. Now, whatever he's got on her, i want you to find out what it is and defuse it, because I told you...",
        "Jeffrey: Careful, alan. You don't want to go back to jail, do you? What have you got?",
        "Assistant D.A.: I have a friend at the syntec lab in chicago. They ran dna tests for someone named bradshaw. He hinted that they were for this case. Thought you might be interested.",
        "Bailiff: All rise.",
        "Judge ellis: Let's continue. If you're up to it, ms. Spaulding.",
        "Jonathan: Where are you going?",
        "Reva: I don't know. Nowhere. Anywhere.",
        "Jonathan: Sounds like a plan.",
        "Reva: I just need to think.",
        "Jonathan: Hey, look, this is why I didn't want to tell you about the fire stuff, because i knew what it would do to you.",
        "Reva: I wanted the truth, whatever it is.",
        "Jonathan: But you don't believe me or my source, do you?",
        "Reva: I know that you told me what you know, and I'm glad you came to me instead of cassie or edmund.",
        "Jonathan: All right, look. I know you're in a rough spot right now, but I really don't want this guy coming after me again, and I definitely don't want him coming after you.",
        "Reva: You're really scared.",
        "Jonathan: Me? Scared?",
        "Reva: Well, whether this story about the fire turns out to be true or not, I still don't know if I can say anything to cassie.",
        "Jonathan: Are you kidding me?",
        "Reva: No, I'm not kidding, because it might not change anything. She's forgiven him before, and why wouldn't she forgive him this time? You know what? Forgive him or not, it doesn't matter, because once I tell her, there's a good chance I'll lose my sister. ( Quiet knocking at door )",
        "Dinah: I thought she'd never leave. Don't you check your messages?",
        "Jonathan: Nice to see you, too.",
        "Dinah: Look, cassie is on her way for the in vitro parade, okay, and if she's carrying edmund's baby, that won't be a cool thing...",
        "Jonathan: Relax. It won't happen.",
        "Dinah: What?",
        "Jonathan: I took care of it.",
        "Dinah: Really?",
        "Jonathan: Mm-hmm.",
        "Dinah: How did you do that?",
        "Jonathan: The same way that you did. I gave you up.",
        "Edmund: Do you remember that fertility clinic we found in palm springs when we were doing our research?",
        "Cassie: The parkington clinic?",
        "Edmund: Mm-hmm.",
        "Cassie: Yeah. It was amazing.",
        "Edmund: Well, I thought we could go there for the retrieval, and then stay until they're ready for us to transfer.",
        "Cassie: You want to switch clinics for the ivf? Why?",
        "Edmund: Well, it's a state- of-the-art medical facility. Come on. And it's got beautiful desert air in a virtual spa setting, beautiful scenery, utter tranquillity.",
        "Cassie: It's 1,500 miles away. I don't want to switch doctors now. I mean, what's the point?",
        "Edmund: Well, the point is you need a stress-free environment, which this is not.",
        "Cassie: Because of reva and jonathan.",
        "Edmund: You need to be relaxed, cassie, and if you just give me a quick \"yes,\" I can go make all the arrangements.",
        "Cassie: I want to stay here. I do. I want to stay here with my doctor that I trust, and I want you by my side. That'S... that'll make me happy. That's what I want.R that's all. Except one other thing, and that would be food, because I'm really, really hungry, so I'm going to make us some dinner. Okay?",
        "Edmund: No, don'T. Don't do that. Don't do that. I'll just nip right out and grab us something to eat.",
        "Cassie: Oh, great. Make yourself useful.",
        "Edmund: Useful? Excuse me, your highness, nothing happens in the baby department without my contribution.",
        "Cassie: Oh. Well, okay. Well, then you better get your rest. Go. Hurry back, hot-shot.",
        "Edmund: Okay.",
        "Sandy: Okay, that was another win. You could have at least let me win one game.",
        "Tammy: You know I don't do that.",
        "Sandy: So competitive.",
        "Tammy: Well, I get it from my mom.",
        "Sandy: How is cassie?",
        "Tammy: She was great when i saw her earlier. She and edmund are moving forward on \"project baby.\"",
        "Sandy: Project baby. Ooh. How do you feel about that?",
        "Tammy: You know, I am excited when anything remotely normal happens in my family. I think a new baby would be great. And it's cute to see edmund wanting it so badly.",
        "Sandy: Kind of crazy, though, right? If you think about where he and your mom started?",
        "Tammy: People change.",
        "Sandy: And I'm a big fan of second chances. Here's to that. I don't know where I'd be if your family hadn't given me one. You think all people are capable of change? Someone like a lizzie or...",
        "Tammy: Jonathan?",
        "Sandy: Yeah.",
        "Tammy: Sometimes I think the change happens when someone comes along who makes you want to be better for them. I guess that could happen for lizzie or jonathan.",
        "Sandy: But you don't see it in the stars?",
        "Tammy: Hey, I know. We should fix them up.",
        "Sandy: Oh, no. Count me out. I have a certain affection for lizzie, so...",
        "Tammy: She ran you over.",
        "Sandy: Oh, yeah, that. Well, it happens. Besides, I... I don't have to pretend to be your cousin anymore now. I can be...",
        "Tammy: What?",
        "Sandy: I can be your roommate. See? And that wouldn't have happened without lizzie and my second chance. So I think lizzie deserves a second chance, just like all the rest of us.",
        "Gus: Lizzie, before we... please remember that phillip spaulding was my brother also, okay? So you and I, we're family, and believe me, the last thing that I... the last thing that I want to...",
        "Lizzie: I know what you want, gus.",
        "Gus: Lizzie, can you please tell the court exactly, in your own words, what happened the night of the murder?",
        "Lizzie: You already know what happened. The whole town knows what happened.",
        "Gus: But we would like to know what you felt that night.",
        "Lizzie: Why does it matter what I felt? What happened, happened.",
        "Gus: Because we'd like to all put ourselves in your position. We'd all like to know what you were feeling in your head from moment to moment. Can you remember that?Q",
        "Lizzie: I don't want to remember. I tried hard enough to forget it.",
        "Gus: But you can't forget it, can you?",
        "Lizzie: Why are you making me relive this?",
        "Gus: Because we all need to know the truth, lizzie, and you know what the truth is, don't you?",
        "Lizzie: It was horrible. I hate that night, everything about it.",
        "Gus: It was horrible because he bullied you. It was horrible because he pushed you too far. Isn't that right?",
        "Lizzie: Yes.",
        "Gus: And what did he do to you?",
        "Lizzie: See, that's the thing. He was so nice. He could be so sweet, but...",
        "Gus: But what? Tell me.",
        "Lizzie: The last night, it was just, like, he was a monster, and I hated him so much. I had to make him go away.",
        "Tammy: I can't believe you're dropping me off and going back to the office.",
        "Sandy: Well, you're more than welcome to come back and phone, file, and fax with me.",
        "Tammy: I clocked out, my friend. Besides, I want to get to the gym before it closes.",
        "Sandy: You're saying I could have had a chance to have the place to myself?",
        "Tammy: This was fun.",
        "Sandy: Thank you for your valuable assistance.",
        "Tammy: No problem. We make a good team.",
        "Bartender: Hey, mrs. Lewis. Long time no see. How's everything with you?",
        "Reva: Double bourbon on the rocks. Does that answer your question?",
        "Bartender: Loud and clear.",
        "Reva: Thanks. You know, craig? Come here. Let me ask you something. If you heard something-- and I'm|\u00fa sure you've encountered this in your line of work-- but if you heard something that could possibly break up a marriage, would you tell the people that it would affect, or would you sit on it?",
        "Bartender: Depends on who i heard it from.",
        "Reva: ( Laughs ) in this case, the person is a pathological liar. But that doesn't necessarily mean it isn't true, although maybe it does, and I just want it to be the truth. And you know what? If I ask for another drink, don't give it to me because my head is already spinning trying to figure out which way to go with this one.",
        "Bartender: Sounds like a tough call.",
        "Reva: Yeah. And I just hope I make the right one when the time comes.",
        "Edmund: Bourbon on the rocks, please. Make it a double. Just be glad you're married to a man who's about to take every aspect of your life under control for the time being, whether you like it or not.",
        "Cassie: He's just overprotective. That's all.",
        "Rj: I didn't break it, mommy.",
        "Cassie: Oh. I know that, honey. I know. Come here. This is edmund's, and he's going to have to fix it, just like he had to fix your truck when the wheels broke off, remember? You know that edmund would do absolutely anything to protect us? You, me, tammy, and will? Because he loves us so much, and we love him, right?",
        "Rj: Yeah.",
        "Cassie: Yeah. Well, you know how we have so much love in this house that there seems to be a lot left over, so we thought that we would give some to a new baby.",
        "Rj: You're going to have a baby, mommy?",
        "Cassie: Well, not yet, but, you know, we're working on it, and we're hoping that we can bring you a little baby sister or a baby brother soon. Wouldn't that be nice? Yeah. This is such a wonderful time, rj. It's exciting, isn't it?Xd",
        "Dinah: You told reva that the fire story came from me?",
        "Jonathan: Yeah. She figured it out. I couldn't lie to my own mother.",
        "Dinah: Your mother is going to kill me, you know that?",
        "Jonathan: Just like uncle eddie wanted to kill me after you let it slip that I spent the night before his wedding with his bride-to-be?",
        "Dinah: Jonathan, I told edmund that cassie was betraying him so that he could see it, that he could see that she was trying to cover up.",
        "Jonathan: Just stop. Look, I'm already at the top of my uncle's hit list because of what I did to tammy. You telling him that doesn't help me any. He finds out, and he forgives cassie anyway.",
        "Dinah: Yeah, I know that, and that's disgusting.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, well, they'd be on their way to the baby- making factory tomorrow if it wasn't for moi stepping in.",
        "Dinah: So you think that you stopped them.",
        "Jonathan: A little show of gratitude would be nice. I tell reva; reva thinks about it, decides to do the right thing; she tells cassie; cassie flips; and-- boom-- the winslows are tanked.",
        "Dinah: What if reva doesn't believe it? Or doesn't tell cassie?",
        "Jonathan: No, reva might not believe you, but she trusts me a little bit. Plus, she already thinks edmund's a nuclear meltdown waiting to happen, which he may be.",
        "Dinah: Cassie still has baby stuff scheduled for tomorrow.",
        "Jonathan: Don't worry. Reva won't let her sis have babies with a guy like that.",
        "Dinah: You're awfully confident.",
        "Jonathan: In everything I do. Don't you love that about a guy?",
        "Gus: You hated him.",
        "Gus: You hated him. You hated him, lizzie, but that was not your fault, right? He made you hate him. And then there was the gun.",
        "Beth: Leave her alone!",
        "Judge ellis: Order. Please sit down.",
        "Beth: Why aren't you doing something to stop this?",
        "Judge ellis: I said sit down, or you will be removed from this courtroom. Mr. O'neill? Do you wish to ask for a postponement?",
        "Jeffrey: No, your honor. The state agrees with mr. Aitoro that it's time that we get to the truth.",
        "Alan: No.",
        "Judge ellis: Spectators will refrain from speaking. I won't say it again. Continue, mr. Aitoro.",
        "Lizzie: ( Sobs )",
        "Gus: Lizzie, everybody has a breaking point. I mean, everybody in this room understands that, believe me. But nobody is here to blame you or to judge you for doing what you thought you had to do. We just need to know what that was. We just need to know, did you pick up that gun? Look, I know that this is very, very painful, okay? Just tell me what happened.",
        "Lizzie: I did it.",
        "Gus: Did what? You picked up the gun?",
        "Lizzie: ( Sobs ) I picked up the gun, and I shot him. Is that what you want to hear? I killed him! ( Sobbing ) Next, on \"guiding light\"...",
        "Edmund: Because if you start a fire, I can promise you, cassie is not the one who's going to end up being burned.",
        "Dinah: It is so perfect. Cassie is never going to forgive edmund for setting the fire.",
        "Jonathan: Or for trying to murder jeffrey o'neill."
