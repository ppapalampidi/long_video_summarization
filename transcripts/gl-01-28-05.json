        "Olivia: I just wanted to thank you for all the new clients, alan. Business is booming. No, bill wasn't happy that i asked him to call off the adoption, but he has no choice, does he? He'll get over it, eventually. Oh, don't stop. That's right. Don't stop sending all thet new business our way. It makes me feel so good, i can't even tell you.",
        "Edmund: That good, huh?",
        "Cassie: Oh, god, the smell of it makes me want to throw up. I must be coming down with something. No, really, you don't want to kiss me.",
        "Edmund: No, really I do.",
        "Cassie: Edmund, the only thing I really want is a long hot shower.",
        "Edmund: All right, I can do that, too.",
        "Tammy: Hello.",
        "Edmund: Well, hello to you. Laundry day.",
        "Tammy: Yeah, is that okay?",
        "Edmund: Okay? Your mom will be thrilled.",
        "Tammy: Where is mom?",
        "Edmund: Upstairs taking a shower. Looking for something?",
        "Tammy: Could you donate those flowers to a funeral home or something?",
        "Edmund: What flowers?",
        "Tammy: The ones that you sent mom with the mushy note. She tried to hide it from me, but I saw it. You guys are so weird. Cute, but weird. What?",
        "Edmund: I was just trying to remember what the mushy note said.",
        "Jonathan: Hey, hey, over here.",
        "Dinah: Hello there, sexy. Who exactly are we hiding from?",
        "Jonathan: Well, I thought it would be a good idea to keep our relationship a secret for now.",
        "Danny: Ooh, relationship. That's an awfully big world for a young guy like yourself. Although I didn't have that in mind, you know, when we...",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, yeah, don't worry bit, I'm not looking to go steady. So I know what you did. The flowers to cassie. I also know she thought I did it.",
        "Dinah: Yeah, I think it's a good idea if we keep the princess on her toes.",
        "Jonathan: This is my deal, okay, and I don't need a partner. So stay out of it.",
        "Dinah: Or else what?",
        "Jonathan: Or else? Did you meet my friend lou yet?",
        "Reva: Jonathan?",

        "Josh: How about a truce.",
        "Reva: Sounds interesting.",
        "Josh: I have come to realize that jonathan is always going to be a part of your life. I also realize that I can't live in the same house with him, so i thought maybe we could make a deal.",
        "Reva: I don't know.",
        "Josh: How's this? As soon as jonathan is recovered, we will get him his own apartment, a place he can call his own.",
        "Reva: Joshua.",
        "Josh: Now, in return for getting him out of this house, i promise you, I promise that i will try to accept him.",
        "Reva: He just got here.",
        "Josh: I know. But this will be good for him, and it will give us a better chance at getting along.",
        "Reva: Okay. But I want to be the one to talk to him about it. As soon as I feel like he's better, then I'll ask him to move out.",
        "Edmund: No really, tammy, perhaps the flower shop didn't hear me correctly. What exactly did the note say?",
        "Tammy: I'm not going to recite it for you.",
        "Edmund: Oh, come on, tammy. All right, that's okay. I've got a meeting to get to anyway. Your mother's been sick. Look after her for me, would you?",
        "Tammy: I'll give it my best shot.",
        "Edmund: Thanks. Oh, and tammy, it's nice to have you back. Maybe next time you can stay longer than for just laundry.",
        "Tammy: No pressure, right?",
        "Jonathan: You want me out?",
        "Reva: We just want you to have a place of your own.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, don't worry, I got it. Must be kind of hard to get it on with little baby sleeping next-door, isn't it?",
        "Reva: We just think that everyone will be happier if we all have a little more privacy. But I don't know why we're talking about this now because you're not going anywhere until that leg is healed.",
        "Jonathan: Well, you want to help me speed that along? Come on, you coached golden boy shayne back on his feet. Why not me?",
        "Josh: I'll think about it. See you later.",

        "Olivia: You have got to be more careful when I'm on the phone with alan.",

        "Olivia: Actually, I'm very serious because if we mess this thing up, he's going to fight for custody of emma.",

        "Olivia: Oh. \"The olivia\" is good.",
        "Bill: She's very good.",
        "Olivia: \"The olivia\" is genius.",

        "Edmund: Love it. Just don't talk me on the way up, all right?",

        "Cassie: I'm fine. I just want to get some air. Why don't you come take a walk with me?",
        "Tammy: No, I can'T. I got to go to orientation.",
        "Cassie: College girl. So what are you going to major in?",
        "Tammy: Keeping a low profile. Lizzie knows about jb. What has she told everybody? What if...",
        "Cassie: Listen to me, okay? College isn't like high school. And I'm not really worried about the other people, I'm worried about you. How are you feeling?",
        "Tammy: I don't know. I keep trying to pretend that what jb... what jonathan did is in the past, that it's all okay. But sometimes I feel like it's never going to be in the past.",
        "Cassie: Listen to me. Don't even say his name. He doesn't exist. Do you hear me? He does not exist.",
        "Dinah: Edmund, come on, I was just going to say good-bye.",
        "Bill: What you doing?",
        "Dinah: I was on the elevator with edmund, he was there, and... look, we weren't going to some, like, elicit rendezvous, okay. Not yet.",
        "Bill: That's all well and good, but you know, he's taken. So maybe you should just walk away before you get hurt again.",
        "Dinah: Bill...",
        "Bill: Yes.",
        "Dinah: I love him.",
        "Bill: You know what you need to do? You need to go find a guy who is going to love you just as much as you love him. That's what you got to do.",
        "Dinah: And I appreciate that. But I think that edmund cares for me, he just doesn't want to face it.",
        "Bill: Oh, man.",
        "Dinah: That marriage is never going to last.",
        "Bill: Well, maybe it will if you stay away from it.",

        "Jeffrey: Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop. Just stop right now.",
        "Olivia: So what? What did I miss? Did I miss something?",

        "Tammy: I know you hate to say his name.",
        "Cassie: I hate everything about him. I hate what he did to you, i hate what he did to... to reva. That kid doesn't mow the difference between right and wrong, and we have to stay away from him and we have to pretend like he went away. Do you hear me?",
        "Tammy: I should have listened to you. You tried to warn me about him, and I just... it just made me want him even more. God, I'm such a loser.",
        "Cassie: No, you're not a loser. Tammy, you're not a loser, okay? What you did... what happened to you is completely understandable. You know, sometimes you have the best intentions and it just blows up anyway. I really wish I could have done something to protect you or reva. God I didn't mean for this to happen. Oh, tammy, it's the last thing that I wanted.",
        "Reva: Okay. This should be all the paperwork you need for the job.",
        "Sandy: All right.",

        "Sandy: Two bedroom, two bath. They're throwing you out already? ( Laughs ) wow, I was here a lot longer.",
        "Jonathan: Why don't you go down to the pound and wag your tail, and maybe somebody will adopt you.",
        "Sandy: I don't need to an don't need to be adopted to belong. You're the outsider. You just don't fit in, and looks like reva is finally onto the real you.",
        "Jonathan: You want to know about the real me? Ask tammy, she can give you all the intimate details.",
        "Sandy: No thanks. Believe it or not, you're not all that interesting.",

        "Edmund: Mr. O'neil, don't tell me what my wife needs.",
        "Tammy: Don't worry, don't worry, okay? I know you want it to be a surprise, so I won't tell edmund.",
        "Cassie: Tell him what?",
        "Tammy: That you're pregnant.",
        "Billy: We just need the pull together as family and take on these people who are trying to bring us down.",
        "Josh: There are forces lining up against us, bill.",
        "Bill: What are you, obi wan kenobi?",
        "Billy: I'm just saying i understand sling shot isn't doing so well, and if they don't, you're always welcome back at lewis construction.",
        "Bill: Wait a minute. Now, sling shot is doing fantastic, thank you very much, okay? This is about olivia, isn't it? Go ahead, just say it. Olivia is bad for you, bill.",

        "Edmund: Questions?",

        "Olivia: Cassie told me you thought you were pregnant a few weeks ago.",
        "Dinah: Yes. I have been trying to get pregnant, but I do believe you also were looking for a spaulding heir, and sometimes have you to work out of the box to get in the box to get cozy.",
        "Olivia: Yeah, but I can tell you that when it involves a child, it's just not that simple.",
        "Dinah: It was for you?",
        "Olivia: Are you kidding me? I have been fighting, fighting to keep emma.",
        "Dinah: Yes, but you have her and you're not alone.",
        "Olivia: Yeah, but not without the spaulding shadow looming over us. And the fear of being separated. I'm telling you, it's no way to live, dinah.",
        "Dinah: Now, I appreciate it, olivia, but I will be just fine. I won't be alone for long.",
        "Jeff: You know, edmund, I was sitting here trying to mind my own business and then you came over here and started this conversation. So I don't know what your problem is, but whatever it is, it's your problem, okay?",
        "Edmund: Save your money, mr. O'neil. Stop sending cassie flowers. That's my job.",
        "Jeffrey: What? You know, whatever is going on between you and cassie, keep me out of it, okay? Thanks.",
        "Cassie: All right. Man, rj, you are not an easy pregnancy. Okay, well, I've had a headache for three days. That's fine, that's caffeine withdrawal. But coffee makes me sick and food... oh. Come on.",
        "Jonathan: Did you tell uncle edmund the baby is ours yet?",
        "Cassie: No. No. No. No, please, please. Please, god, please, don't let me be pregnant by that monster. Please, I will do anything.

        "Olivia: So who's the lucky guy? Come on, you must have picked someone to be the daddy of your baby. Who is he?",
        "Bill: Who's who?",
        "Olivia: Nothing. Never mind.",
        "Dinah: No, it's okay. Olivia and I were just talking about the fact that a baby would complete me, and of course who the possible fathers could be.",

        "Olivia: I was just introducing her to a guy I knew from the gym while you were out there with josh and billy. So what was that about anyway?",
        "Bill: Nothing.",
        "Olivia: Nothing?",
        "Bill: Nothing.",
        "Olivia: Fine. Don't tell me. I mean, we don't have to share everything, right? Keeps life interesting.",
        "Bill: Very interesting. In fact, why don't me make it a little more interesting.",
        "Olivia: What did you have in mind?",
        "Bill: This little slow dance we got going on with alan? I think it's time we speed things up.",
        "Dinah: You know, if you took this off, we could probably finish that conversation.",
        "Corey: God, I'd love to. But I have to get to the hospital.",
        "Dinah: You know, maybe sometime I can come by and visit? I really am interested in what you do.",
        "Corey: Really?",
        "Dinah: You know, a girl's got to have a hobby. Come on.",

        "Sandy: I will.",
        "Tammy: So do you usually lift weights or what?",
        "Sandy: Yeah, and I ride the bike and I slam the bag around. And sometimes I do katas.",

        "Sandy: Is it's working?",
        "Tammy: Kind of.",
        "Sandy: All right. Get a deep stance. Every good punch, kick or block starts in a good stance. Straight leg, bend your knee. Hands up, tuck your chin. And you're going to want to snap that kick out there, like with the toes back, so you hit with the ball of the foot, you know? Nice. Yeah. Okay. Well, what about an attack. Someone grabs you, like this, from behind. You're trapped, right? Whoa!",
        "Tammy: Ooh, I'm sorry. Oh, are you okay?",

        "Cassie: No matter what... no matter what we'll always talk, and we'll never jump to conclusions with each other.",
        "Edmund: About what?",
        "Cassie: In anything, you know? You just always hear that couples never really listen to each other and they never really give each other the benefit of the doubt.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, cassie, nothing is ever going to come between us. Now what's going on?",
        "Cassie: Nothing, I just want to everything to stay the way it is right now. Edmumd, I love you so much.",

        "Nurse: Oh, and good luck. It sounds like this pregnancy test may be the one.",
        "Reva: What are you doing?",
        "Jonathan: Nothing. My buddy the owner, he lets me take what I want and I just leave him a note and he puts it on my tab, and I pay him later. But look, I got some stuff for you. Check it out.",
        "Reva: Thanks. Cool.",
        "Jonathan: You don't have to do that.",
        "Reva: Well, no, no. I just feel better if I paid for myself.",
        "Jonathan: Hey, I'm rich, remember?",
        "Reva: Yeah.",
        "Jonathan: Trust fund.",
        "Reva: I know, but that's money you're going to want to hang onto for your education or whatever else you choose to do with your life.",
        "Jonathan: I'm already doing it. I told myself that I was going to find my real mother, and i did it.",
        "Reva: I know it hasn't been easy for you at home.",
        "Jonathan: Well, neither of us.",
        "Reva: I'm sure it's hard to be in a place where you feel so unwanted. I mean not unwanted by me, but...",
        "Jonathan: No, I get it, I get what you're saying. The only thing I don't get: Sandy. When he was pretending to be me, didn't it ever feel like something was off?",
        "Reva: I know it would make you feel better if I said yes, but no.",
        "Jonathan: You still love him, don't you?",
        "Reva: You're my son, jonathan.",
        "Jonathan: Too bad, huh?",
        "Reva: No. No, I see so much of myself in you. Not always the very best kind of stuff, but I see more of me in you than I ever did in my son dylan or shayne or marah. I spent so many years, you know, with people trying to tame me-- my mama and hb, and joshua-- and it almost worked. I'd almost forgotten what I used to want and need until you came along to remind me.",
        "Jonathan: Is that good or bad?",
        "Reva: I don't know. But I know you're my son, and i love you, jonathan. I love you.",

        "Policeman: Save it for the judge.",
        "Reva: The judge?",
        "Policeman: You're under arrest.",
        "Edmund: Thank you, but I'd like to go with you.",
        "Cassie: That's okay, I don't need you. I'm fine.",
        "Edmund: You need me for your pregnancy test. Is there a reason you don't want me to be there for the test?"
