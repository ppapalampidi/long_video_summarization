    "Recap": [
        "Sally tells Saul that they have a show coming up and she has given him plenty of designs so she needs to see some results. Rick and RJ tell Zende that although he has told her before he needs to keep telling Nicole that he loves her and will be true to her. They can have a future together. Maya and Nicole discuss the situation. Maya says people make mistakes but they want to do better and as time passes we need to forgive as it is important for us as well. Nicole calls Zende but he tells Rick this cannot be by text; he needs to see her in person. Anything he does from now on will have to do with Nicole. Nicole admits to Maya that the person she turns to the most is Zende. And he keeps proposing and says he will until she accepts. They open a fortune cookie and clearly it is for Nicole and from Zende. She says every day is something new. Thomas goes to see Sally but encounters Carlita first instead. Sally asks to what does she owe this pleasure. Perhaps he says to make it up somehow to Steffy. All he can add is that Sally's designs are .well nice.",
        "Steffy grouses to Liam that Sally is out to get her. Liam adds and the older Sally is probably out there on the beach somewhere laughing at their expense. But they do agree that Australia would be perfect site for their wedding. Sally keeps on at Thomas of why he is there and he leans over and plants a big kiss on her; completely puts her back on her heels. Nicole is all dressed for a photo shoot and Maya takes her outside where an antique white carriage rolls up complete with a white horse and Zende in the back seat in top hat and coat. He laments to a stunned Nicole that what better way to ride off into the sunset together. He will not give up until she realizes that. He wants to grow old with her and have a family. She says there are certain hurts that can never happen again. He gets down on his knees and says if she feels the same way he does they can start their life together. Suddenly she says yes she will marry him. He slips the ring on and kisses her ..Rick, Maya and RJ applaud from a distance."

        "Steffy: Sally 2.0 is gonna learn exactly what her great-aunt learned years ago. Never go up against Stephanie Forrester.",
        "Sally: So, let's see what we've got so far.",
        "Saul: Nothing, you mean?",
        "Sally: Don't be ridiculous. Saul, we have a show coming up. I've given you plenty of designs. That tape around your neck is not just for decoration. I know you have been using it.",
        "Saul: Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes, I have, but --",
        "Sally: Okay, so let's see what we have so far.",
        "Saul: Okay. Okay. Just -- all right. Just -- I'll be right back.",
        "Sally: [Sighs] I can't wait to see the look on Steffy Forrester's face whenever our fashion preview knocks her socks off.",
        "Darlita: How would that even happen? Socks don't just come off.",
        "[Telephone rings]",
        "Sally: The phone is ringing, Darlita.",
        "Zende: Nicole and I belong together -- I know it.",
        "Rick: Man, we all know it. But if you hurt somebody too much...",
        "Zende: Never again. That is what I have to get her to understand.",
        "R.J.: Well, you told her, right? I mean, how sorry you are?",
        "Zende: Of course. Over and over again.",
        "R.J.: Well, then keep on telling her until she eventually hears you.",
        "Nicole: So, who's the photographer?",
        "Maya: Zende.",
        "Nicole: [Laughs] Right. Of course. Yeah, I'm not doing this.",
        "Maya: Nicole!",
        "Nicole: I'm not getting dressed up in some period gown on a horse-drawn carriage in front of the man that -- in front of Zende. Hey. It's Nicole. What do you know about this photo shoot we're doing today? Call me.",
        "Maya: You're doing the shoot. You'll be glad you did.",
        "Zende: Ahh. Nicole's been trying to reach me.",
        "R.J.: Hey, that's a good sign.",
        "Rick: Well, aren't you gonna call her back?",
        "Zende: No. No, there's something I want to say to her, but it has to be in person.",
        "Nicole: It's beautiful.",
        "Maya: You'll be beautiful in it.",
        "Nicole: No, you should be the one.",
        "Maya: It's fitted for you.",
        "Nicole: Isn't Sasha available?",
        "Maya: It doesn't matter if she's available or not.",
        "Nicole: But if Zende's the photographer --",
        "Maya: He is human, Nicole.",
        "Nicole: I know.",
        "Maya: Look, people make mistakes. They break our trust. And it feels like the hurt's never gonna end. But time passes and we realize that forgiveness is possible. And it's not only possible... it's necessary. Because we want to trust again. It's obvious you still love him. What good is it doing you to pretend that you don't?",
        "Nicole: What are you saying?",
        "Maya: Put on the dress. That's all. Stay open to what happens next.",
        "Liam: Hmm. Stones all appear to be in place. Could use a cleaning.",
        "Steffy: [Scoffs] Funny. No more food fights for this girl.",
        "Liam: What? No! Hey! That's hot -- you flinging dessert at your rival. Just take the ring off next time.",
        "Steffy: Are you kidding? I'm never taking this ring off.",
        "Liam: Oh.",
        "Steffy: But let's not call sally Spectra a rival. That means that she has a chance in the business, and she doesn't.",
        "Liam: Noted.",
        "Steffy: Good. I mean, the only chance she really has is becoming an even bigger embarrassment than she already is.",
        "Thomas: Hi.",
        "Darlita: How may you help me?",
        "Thomas: I'm sorry, what?",
        "Darlita: I mean, can I help you?",
        "Thomas: Hmm. Some things really don't change, do they?",
        "Darlita: If you're here about payment of some kind, sally says...",
        "Sally: Sally says show the gentleman in.",
        "Darlita: Um, can I get you anything? Soda? Diet water?",
        "Thomas: No, I'm fine. Thank you.",
        "Darlita: Yes, you are.",
        "Sally: That'll be all, Darlita! So... a real-life Forrester coming down to the slums of Spectra. To what do I owe the pleasure?",
        "Thomas: Well, I came to see if you're as mad as Steffy as she is with you.",
        "Sally: Oh, she's mad?",
        "Thomas: Mm-hmm. Furious.",
        "Sally: Ooh. I didn't realize she was so sensitive. Well, do you have any ideas on how to make it up to queen Steffy?",
        "Thomas: My recommendation? Get as far away as you can.",
        "Rick: Why does it seem like you're up to something?",
        "Zende: Who, me?",
        "R.J.: Okay, now, he's definitely up to something.",
        "Rick: Yeah, involving Nicole?",
        "Zende: Look. Anything I do from now on is gonna involve Nicole, all right? Bye.",
        "Rick: Do you need some help?",
        "Nicole: I guess it could be kind of fun.",
        "Maya: It will be!",
        "Nicole: And not just the photo shoot.",
        "Maya: Yes. Forgiveness can be fun. Opening your heart up to what you need? I mean, what's more fun than that?",
        "[Both chuckle]",
        "Maya: Look, Zende was wrong, but we all have responsibility in it. We all played our parts. Rick and I most of all, asking you to have another baby for us.",
        "Nicole: I knew he was against the idea. I disappointed him so much.",
        "Maya: Yeah, and he turned right back around and disappointed you. That's life. And you can't expect that it's always gonna be a smooth journey. And you certainly can't expect that you or Zende or anybody else is gonna be on perfect behavior in any situation 'cause it just doesn't happen. But my question for you is -- who do you want to be with when things don't go as planned?",
        "Nicole: Zende.",
        "Maya: Okay. And he's been loyal to you, right? Committed since you broke up?",
        "Nicole: Yeah, I mean, loyal enough to propose. To insist that he's going to keep proposing until I accept.",
        "Maya: Sounds like a committed man to be.",
        "[Both chuckle]",
        "Nicole: He writes me letters. I mean, actual letters. Not e-mails. Handwritten.",
        "Maya: Wow. Mr. Romantic.",
        "Nicole: And it goes way beyond that. He does all kinds of things. Every day, it's something new. Some reminder that he cares. Who ordered this takeout?",
        "Maya: Oh, I don't know, I think Pam had an intern go out, or something.",
        "Nicole: Well, clearly Zende intervened. Look.",
        "Maya: \"Nicole, your happiness is my only concern.\"",
        "Nicole: As I said, every day it's something new.",
        "Maya: You think you can live without this man?",
        "Steffy: Check her posts again, will you? I don't want to look at it again.",
        "Liam: Whose?",
        "Steffy: Sally Spectra.",
        "Liam: I thought we didn't care about her.",
        "Steffy: I -- [Sighs] I know... it just bothers me! I mean, who does that? She's clearly using my online success to create Buzz for herself.",
        "Liam: Who does that? Um... sally Spectra does that. And if the stories about her aunt are any indication, she's probably sipping a mai tai on a beach somewhere, enjoying every minute of it.",
        "Saul: Okay, sally. Presenting our first two.",
        "Sally: Oh, no. No, no, no!",
        "Saul: No, no! I got it!",
        "Thomas: Wait. Sally, are those your designs?",
        "Sally: No, they're a work in progress. Come on! Not now. Not now, Saul. We'll talk about those later. Okay. I really appreciate it. Thank you. Goodbye. [Sighs] What?",
        "Thomas: You want my opinion?",
        "Sally: Do I have a choice?",
        "Thomas: [Inhales sharply] They're... they're nice.",
        "Sally: Nice?! Really? Nice? Seriously? Grandmothers are nice. A cold beer is nice. What about trendsetting? Historic. Sensational. Red-hot.",
        "Thomas: Yeah. Yeah, sure. Yeah. Quite -- quite possibly.",
        "Sally: All right, bucko. What gives?",
        "Thomas: I'm sorry. I don't know what you mean.",
        "Sally: Those are two of my favorite pieces! What about cutting-edge? What about pure Spectra style -- and you look like you're stifling a yawn.",
        "Thomas: Okay. Like I said, they're...nice.",
        "Sally: And so are you, or you would be saying a whole lot more.",
        "Liam: Shh. Breathe. Sit down. Sit down. Sit down. Sit down. Sit down. Sit down. Okay. Repeat after me. \"Sally Spectra doesn't matter.\"",
        "Steffy: Sally Spectra doesn't matter.",
        "Liam: That's right! And what does?",
        "Steffy: Us.",
        "Liam: Exactly! Uh, speaking of us, I was actually talking to ivy earlier...",
        "Steffy: Okay, not the best transition...",
        "Liam: No, no, no! About the wedding of which she is totally supportive, and she kind of had an interesting idea.",
        "Steffy: Okay...",
        "Liam: Ivy suggested Australia. And, I don't know, it might be a nice place to exchange vows.",
        "Steffy: Hmm. I like it.",
        "Liam: Yeah?",
        "Steffy: Yeah. We can get away from L.A. And all the drama...",
        "Liam: Right. Exactly.",
        "Steffy: I think an Australian wedding might be exactly what we need.",
        "Sally: Okay. So you don't like my designs. Big whoop.",
        "Thomas: I didn't say that.",
        "Sally: Oh, you didn't have to, I could tell.",
        "Thomas: I like them. They're fine. They'll probably sell. I just don't want you to get your expectations too high.",
        "Sally: You're scared.",
        "Thomas: No.",
        "Sally: Yes, you are. And so is your sister. She sent you here, didn't she?",
        "Thomas: No.",
        "Sally: Yes, she did. She sent you here to undermine my confidence.",
        "Thomas: Sally, come on.",
        "Sally: No, that's cool. You can tell her it didn't work, okay? That my designs aren't exactly house of Forrester, but I'm okay with that, with being the underdog, okay? Because some of us have to claw and scratch our way to success. And we like it that way. So I won't let you come in here and tell me that I don't get to have my moment.",
        "Thomas: That's not what I'm saying.",
        "Sally: Okay. Really, Thomas? Then why are you here? If not to undermine me, why are you here?",
        "Sally: Okay.",
        "Nicole: Um, I'm starting to second-guess this.",
        "Maya: Why? You'll be fine!",
        "Nicole: I don't know if I'm ready.",
        "Maya: To model?",
        "Nicole: Ready for Zende!",
        "Maya: Oh.",
        "Nicole: It hurts every time I see him.",
        "Maya: You know why it hurts.",
        "Nicole: [Sighs] Because of how much I care about him.",
        "Maya: Yeah. Look. There's your carriage.",
        "Nicole: What --",
        "Maya: Guys, did you see it?",
        "Rick: I see it, yeah!",
        "Nicole: Zende?",
        "Zende: At your service.",
        "Nicole: What -- what are you doing? I -- I don't understand. You're part of the photo shoot?",
        "Zende: We're doing this together.",
        "Nicole: What are you -- what are you doing? What's with the horse and carriage?",
        "Zende: What better way to ride off into the sunset together?",
        "Nicole: Zende...",
        "Zende: Look. You can turn me down 100 times. I don't care. All right? I'm not giving up until you realize that we are supposed to be together. You are the one that I want, the only want I want to spend the rest of my life with. Look, I know I hurt you. I haven't forgotten that, okay? But you have to understand how much I want to be with you. How much I want to marry you. Grow old together, have a family.",
        "Nicole: I do.",
        "Zende: Wait, Nicole, what are you saying to me right now? What are you -- what are you saying?",
        "Nicole: There are certain hurts that can never happen again.",
        "Zende: Look. I will never betray you again. I swear it. Take this ring. We don't have to wait! We can get married right away! And if you feel the same way I do... let's start our life together.",
        "Nicole: Yes.",
        "Zende: Yes?",
        "Nicole: Yes, I'll marry you!",
        "Maya: Yes!"
