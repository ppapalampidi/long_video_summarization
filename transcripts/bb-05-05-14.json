        "Bill embraces Brooke and is happy to get the papers back giving him the CEO position and equal custody of Will. She tells him what are they waiting for. Go to SP and take back his office. Ridge rushes back to SP where Katie tells him that she is not CEO anymore; this is not her office. Bill will be taking over. She thought Brooke had destroyed those papers but apparently she hadn't. She was using them to make Katie see things her way. This wasn't Bill's idea; she thinks Brooke is doing this all on her own. Ridge says they haven't changed, so don't let Bill and Brooke destroy what they have. As they discuss it, Brooke and Bill walk in with Bill holding Will. Katie takes him. Bill walks around his office and tells Katie that he is sorry. He knows this is not easy for her. She vows that she will fight him on this. Katie tells Brooke to shut up when Brooke says she really didn't want to do this but Katie forced it. Katie tries to block Bill when he says they will work out a new schedule for Will. She says he has his schedule and she doesn't want to break it .the friends he plays with, his sleeping and nap time, meals. Bill says she was an executive before all of this took place and he is offering her to still be an executive here now, so Will can still come to the nursery and have his friends and schedule. But as far as her employees, he will base that on performance, not on spite. Katie glares at Brooke as she and Ridge leave. Quinn finds Wyatt working on the Rooftop. She barges in and says Hope is with Liam and he should be concerned. Wyatt grouses that she can date a dozen guys. He doesn't care because in the end she will end up with him. Back in her office, Hope gives Liam a big hug for all he did for her today. They bring Honey Butt in a box and they set him on the desk. Pam pets HB and then Wyatt and Quinn come in. The cat sneezes at Quinn. Hope tells them this is the newest addition to her family. Pam takes HB for a stroll. Wyatt somewhat thinks it is great that Liam is interested in animal rights. Liam says it is just one of his many passions. Before Liam leaves with emergency work phone call, Wyatt tells him that tonight is his turn for night shift with Hope. Liam walks in just as Bill is holding Will and already sitting back in his chair. Bill tells Liam that Katie's reign is over. His daddy is CEO again. He gives Bill a big group hug.",
        "Wyatt tells Hope that she can say it, chalk one up for Yoga Boy. Hope says she was really proud of him today. He's taken on a really great cause. Wyatt quips that maybe he should find one of those .like guys that have to share their girlfriend ..now there's a support group waiting to happen. Two incredible guys now, such a dilemma. But not really. Liam is a good guy, how could he not since he is his brother, but only one of them can make her happy and has consistently. They share a kiss. Quinn shows up at Liam's office. She says rescue shelter, buying Hope a cat, she is not surprised when it comes from a pussy cat like Liam. They end up sparring and he says he has principles and so does Hope and that is what they share, something that Wyatt doesn't. Justin and Allison congratulate Bill. She says this calls for champagne since the wicked Witch of the East has gone back to Oz. Bill warns her not to do that. Katie is in pain and they aren't going to take any pleasure in it. At home, Katie isn't sure what she wants to do. Does she fight this .how can she go back to work there after being CEO and just sit in an office. She says she has operated with anger and sadness for so long that she is not sure she can function without it. Ridge says a new beginning is good; he's looking forward to one with her. He just needs a yes or no answer \u0096 if she will marry him."

        "Wyatt: No.",
        "Quinn: She's with Liam.",
        "Wyatt: So what if she's with Liam? I'll see her tonight. Equal time, remember?",
        "Quinn: And you're okay with that?",
        "Wyatt: She can date a dozen guys. I don't care, 'cause I know she'll always end up with me.",
        "Quinn: [Sighs]",
        "Liam: This is where she works with her brother, Rick. That would be your uncle.",
        "Hope: [Laughs]",
        "Liam: You are just so cute.",
        "Hope: Thank you, Liam. Thank you for everything you did for me today.",
        "Liam: Yeah? You had fun?",
        "Hope: Yes. Oh, my gosh. I am going to that shelter just, you know, every week.",
        "Liam: Until there's no animals left and they're all yours?",
        "Hope: Probably.",
        "Liam: Yeah.",
        "Hope: Yes. Come here, baby. I want to hold my little love. Hi!",
        "Liam: Hey!",
        "Hope: Look at you! Come here, honey bun. Oh, yes! Ohh. Hi, little. Ohh.",
        "Hope: Isn't he adorable?",
        "Pam: He is so cute. My tiny loved cats.",
        "Liam: You should adopt one, Pam.",
        "Pam: Oh, don't tempt me, Liam. Where'd you get this little guy?",
        "Hope: Well, Liam is doing a feature on animals, and he took me to a shelter. He surprised me.",
        "Pam: Wow!",
        "Hope: I am just so proud of the work that you are doing.",
        "Liam: It's my pleasure. Are you kidding?",
        "Pam: Incoming.",
        "Hope: Hi.",
        "Wyatt: Hi. What -- what do we have here?",
        "Hope: This is the newest addition to my family.",
        "Wyatt: Oh.",
        "Hope: Liam took me to an animal rescue.",

        "[Cat sneezes]",
        "Wyatt: Bless you.",

        "Pam: Come on, sweetheart. We don't want you catching any weird diseases.",
        "Liam: [Snickers]",
        "Ridge: Papers? What papers?",
        "Katie: Justin drew up these papers, and Bill conned me into signing them. They give him equal custody of will, and they reinstate him as C.E.O. I thought Brooke had destroyed them, but, apparently, she hadn't.",
        "Ridge: And now they want to cash in?",
        "Katie: Yes. She was using them to get me to see things her way.",
        "Ridge: This was Bill's idea. You know that.",
        "Katie: No. No. I don't think so. I think Brooke is doing this all on her own.",
        "Bill: You've given me back my son...",
        "Brooke: He never should have been taken from you.",
        "Bill: ...And my company.",
        "Brooke: You're C.E.O. again!",
        "Bill: This couldn't have been easy for you.",
        "Brooke: No. No, it wasn't. I had a talk with Katie, and she wasn't really hearing me, so it had to be done. So, what are you waiting for?! Come on! Let's go get you back in that office, where you belong! [Laughs]",
        "Wyatt: Wow. Animal rights. Good for you.",
        "Liam: Yeah. Well, I mean, it's one of my passions.",
        "Hope: It really is incredible. I mean, if you're going to get a pet, it's really important that you adopt from a rescue shelter.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Liam: Yeah.",
        "Hope: Yeah.",
        "Liam: Yeah. Oh, my God. Quinn, you should adopt. How 'bout a Yorkie -- soften up your image a bit?",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles] A new kitten? I mean, it's so cute.",
        "Liam: Maybe we can teach him some tricks tonight.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, like how to kidnap a feline down the street.",
        "Hope: All right, guys.",
        "Wyatt: Anyway, you had her all day, so, uh, I get a night shift.",
        "Liam: Well, technically, I think it's up to hope.",
        "[Cell phone chimes]",
        "Liam: Ugh. Oh, man. I got a work emergency. I got to go.",
        "Wyatt: Aw, shucks.",
        "Hope: Thank you so much for today.",
        "Liam: Yeah, of course. I'm glad you had fun.",
        "Hope: Thank you. Ohh. I love my kitten.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles]",
        "Hope: [Chuckles]",
        "Liam: Good. All right. I'll see you later.",

        "Liam: Okay? Oh, Quinn, I wasn't kidding about that Yorkie.",
        "Hope: [Sighs]",
        "Wyatt: Mom?",
        "Quinn: What?",
        "Wyatt: Uh, you have inventory to do, I think, right?",
        "Quinn: Yes. Of course.",
        "Katie: So, this is no longer my office. Things change quickly around here.",
        "Ridge: You haven't changed. We haven't changed. Don't let them destroy what we have.",
        "Katie: They won't. I just can't believe that Brooke did this. I mean, she led me to believe that she was just as disgusted with what Bill did as I was. That's why she took the papers -- so that he couldn't use them against me -- and now she's doing what he wanted to do. And it's not just about the company. It's my son -- my son. I've lost sole custody of my son. I have no control over his life anymore.",
        "Ridge: We should get out of here.",
        "Katie: I should just give all this to Bill.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Will: Mama.",
        "Katie: Hi! Hey, baby! Hi. Hi.",
        "Bill: [Sighs]",
        "Ridge: Hey.",
        "Bill: I'm sorry, Katie. I know this isn't easy for you.",
        "Katie: I'm gonna fight you. I've already talked to my attorney. I've talked to Karen. I'm gonna give you a legal battle like you've never seen.",
        "Bill: I've seen enough of them to know that this one would be over before it even began. I'm C.E.O. Again, Katie, as it should be.",
        "Ridge: Not really fair play, is it?",
        "Bill: Why are you chiming in? You were off in Paris, eating baguettes, while Katie and Karen were conning me out of my own company, but we're not gonna get into that.",
        "Ridge: As long as we're all aware, Billy.",
        "Brooke: Katie, you know I didn't want to do this.",
        "Katie: Shut up, Brooke.",
        "Brooke: I couldn't reason with you.",
        "Bill: All right, look -- look... there's no reason to harbor bad feelings. A lot can be said by all parties, and none of it matters. I am C.E.O. again. It's done. We'll work out a new visitation schedule, Katie.",
        "Katie: He has a schedule, Bill.",
        "Bill: Well, as of today, his schedule has changed.",
        "Katie: [Sighs] He's, um -- he's got playdates with kids in the nursery. Are you gonna bring him to work like I used to?",
        "Bill: No. You will. You were an executive in this company before all this took place, and I am going to extend an offer to you to be an executive here now.",
        "Ridge: [Sighs] Let's get out of here. Come on.",
        "Katie: What about the people how work for me?",
        "Bill: What about them?",
        "Katie: I don't want them losing their jobs.",
        "Bill: This company needs to be stabilized. I will make decisions based on performance, not spite.",
        "Brooke: Bill's not a dictator, Katie.",
        "Katie: You know nothing. You've never worked for him. You've only slept with him.",
        "[Will fusses]",
        "Katie: Um, I'm gonna put together a bag and send it over. He's got a blue blanket that he won't go to sleep without, and he's got a very specific schedule at night, and I think you should stick to it because it makes him feel safe to know what's expected. [Voice breaking] We usually do a bath, and then I read him a few stories and usually sing to him, but...",
        "Bill: Katie, Katie...",
        "[Will fusses]",
        "Bill: ...You love him. So do I.",
        "Katie: [Crying] Okay. [Sniffles] Okay. You're gonna go have fun with daddy and aunt Brooke, okay? I love you more than anything. Have fun.",
        "Bill: Come here, will.",
        "[Will fusses]",
        "Bill: Come here. Let's get doggy.",
        "Katie: Okay. Have fun. Love you.",
        "Bill: Come here. Come here. Look. Look.",
        "[Will crying]",
        "Liam: Hey. What's going on? What -- but what about --",
        "Bill: Katie's reign is over. Your daddy is C.E.O. again.",
        "Liam: [Laughs] C-congratulations! Hey, will. Oh, man.",
        "Bill: Thanks to Brooke.",
        "Hope: Is your mom really allergic to cats?",
        "Wyatt: Uh, who knows? Any chance Liam is, though?",
        "Hope: Sorry. No such luck.",
        "Wyatt: No! He blew you away today, didn't he?",
        "Hope: He was... pretty impressive.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. Knocked your socks off. You can admit it. That's okay. Chalk one up for yoga boy.",
        "Hope: You know, I'm really proud of him. I am. He's taking on a really, really difficult cause.",
        "Wyatt: Hmm. Maybe I should get one of those. Let's see -- guys who have to share their girlfriend. There's a support group waiting to happen there.",
        "Hope: Oh, I promise I'm not gonna drag this out.",
        "Wyatt: I'm just -- okay, I'm kidding, okay? Take all the time that you need, 'cause I already know the endgame.",
        "Hope: Really? You know, Liam seems to think he knows the endgame, too. God, you guys -- you're so much more alike than you realize.",
        "Wyatt: Oh, come on! That is -- that is such a blow to the ego, if you ever heard one!",
        "Hope: You are! You're both incredible.",
        "Wyatt: Is that supposed to be a compliment?",
        "Hope: Yes, of the highest magnitude.",
        "Wyatt: Two incredible guys. Such a dilemma.",
        "Hope: [Sighs] But it is.",
        "Wyatt: No... it's not. Look, Liam is a great guy, all right? And how could he not be? He's my brother. Hmm? No? Okay. But only one of us can truly make you happy... and has... consistently.",
        "Liam: I know, right?! How great is that? He's back, baby. Okay, get to it. Thanks.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Liam: Come on in. Ah, geez.",
        "Quinn: Rescue shelter? Buying hope a kitten? Wow. Not surprising from a pussycat like you.",
        "Liam: [Sighs] [Chuckles]",
        "Bill: Big boy. [Chuckles]",
        "Brooke: [Chuckles] Mm.",
        "Alison: Is it true? You're back?",
        "Bill: It is.",
        "Justin: [Chuckles]",
        "Bill: And you're a brunette. I didn't give you permission.",
        "Alison: I assumed there was only room for one blonde in your life now.",
        "Brooke: [Laughs]",
        "Justin: I thought those papers Katie signed were long gone.",
        "Bill: Well, so did I. But Brooke had them the whole time.",
        "Brooke: And now that Bill and Karen have equal ownership of the company once again...",
        "Justin: C.E.O. reverts to you, dollar Bill. Congratulations. Glad to have you back.",
        "Bill: Good to be back.",
        "Alison: This calls for champagne. The wicked witch of the east has gone back to oz!",
        "Bill: Uh, Alison... I don't want to hear any of that. Katie's in pain. We're not gonna take any pleasure in it.",
        "Katie: I just can't believe that any of this is happening.",
        "Ridge: I'm sorry.",
        "Katie: That job meant a lot to me. The people there meant a lot to me. I felt like I was really making a difference.",
        "Ridge: You've made a difference all your life. You're gonna continue to do that.",
        "Katie: Thank you for being there for me. This has been a really bad day.",
        "Ridge: What can I do to make it better?",
        "Liam: Kind of busy here, Quinn. You want to take it somewhere else, maybe?",
        "Quinn: Don't dismiss me, you little tree hugger.",
        "Liam: Geez. You got something against animals and trees now?",
        "Quinn: She isn't that shallow, Liam. Buying her with a kitten?",
        "Liam: Excuse me. She rescued an animal that probably didn't have much time left. That's not shallow. That's responsible and compassionate.",
        "Quinn: You're monopolizing her time, and that isn't part of the deal.",
        "Liam: I do not have a deal with you, Quinn. Hope is a woman of principle. I share those principles. I have shared those principles since long before you and Wyatt even arrived on the scene. That's what she looks for in a relationship. That's what I have to offer her and what Wyatt doesn't.",
        "Quinn: [Scoffs]",
        "[Cat meows]",
        "Hope: Yes.",
        "Brooke: So... how does it feel?",
        "Bill: [Chuckles]",
        "Brooke: [Chuckles]",
        "Bill: Better than I want to say.",
        "Brooke: Go ahead. You can say it.",
        "Bill: At times, I wondered if this day would ever come... if I'd be back in this place. I raised it. I nurtured it. I protected it. It's almost like this little guy -- one of my children. I was lost without it, Brooke. I was lost without him. I have it all back. I have my life back. I have you... I have my son...",
        "[Will fusses]",
        "Bill: Mm. ...And I have my company... all because of an incredible woman. Thank you.",
        "Katie: [Sighs] Bill wants me to continue to work at Spencer. I mean, can I do that? Can I walk in that building every day, knowing that I used to run the place? And then what -- I just sit obediently in my office?",
        "Ridge: Hey, hey, hey. You don't have to make a decision right now. Sleep on it. Things always look better in the morning.",
        "Katie: Maybe you can get me a job at Forrester.",
        "Ridge: Mm, I'll see what I can do. You want one?",
        "Katie: [Laughing] No, not really. To be honest, I don't know what I want. I mean, do I fight this? I just feel like I've been fighting for so long. I really believe that my vision for the company was starting to pay off. What do I do about that? And do I put my son through that? My son. My son.",
        "Ridge: Your son's gonna be fine. I don't know about Bill, but Brooke knows how to handle a toddler.",
        "Katie: [Sighs] Well, they're probably not gonna get much sleep tonight. [Chuckles]",
        "Ridge: That's their problem.",
        "Katie: I just feel like, once again, I'm starting over.",
        "Ridge: In a way, you are. I know it's hard. There's a lot of things to sort through, but... [Sighs] Maybe it's not all bad. No, no. Stop.",
        "Katie: [Chuckles]",
        "Ridge: Maybe there's an opportunity here -- a new beginning.",
        "Katie: You really think so?",
        "Ridge: I do. I know it's scary, but, honestly... I like the idea of starting over with you. New life -- the life that we want. We free ourselves of all the baggage of the past. I like that. It's exciting to me.",
        "Katie: Free, huh? Completely new? Wow. I've lived with so much anger and sadness for so long, I'm not sure I know how to function without it.",
        "Ridge: All you have to do is make a choice.",
        "Katie: A choice?",
        "Ridge: It's easy. It's a yes-or-no answer.",
        "Katie: What's the question?",
        "Ridge: Will you marry me?",
        "Katie: [Gasps]"
