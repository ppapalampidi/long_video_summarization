        "Thomas re-arranges some pictures in Douglas's room, putting Caroline's away and adding Hope and some of her with Douglas. Hope looks in and he lies that he was only checking under the bed and no more monsters. He says he feels terrible that he did not hear Douglas's scream and only glad that she made it to him on time. It made all the difference in the world. She stays a moment and says she is on her way over to see Liam as she thinks she owes him this news in person. Eric and Quinn drop in on Ridge and Brooke. He says it only happened last night but Xander called and said he is going back home; he had no other alternative. Thomas joins them and hugs Eric and Quinn and glad they came on such short notice. He explains that last night Hope said she wanted to get married as soon as possible. She is as anxious as he is. Brooke tells Thomas that she does not understand this. She thought Hope wanted to wait a while. He tells her about the nightmare Douglas had that caused her to push the wedding up so she could be his mommy now. This is what Hope wants; he did not pressure her in any way. Ridge joins in and says they can ask Hope. Eric says they would love to host another wedding at his place. Quinn says they have more than one impromptu wedding at their home. Thomas thanks him but says now that Douglas considers this is home he thought it would be special if they could marry here in this house. Ridge says of course they can. Thomas even says he would like the cousins to come and they could have festive balloons, stuffed animals and such and make it a real special occasion. Hope is on board for that too.",
        "Thomas explains to Douglas what a best man is who stands by the groom all day and he would like him to be that best man. Douglas is delighted. Then Thomas sits by his bed and has a fantasy of Hope there in her lingerie and being the aggressor as she takes off his shirt and says she does not want to wait for their wedding night. She wants him now and always. It rocks Liam when Hope says the wedding will be tomorrow. He asks questions and she has to explain about the nightmare Douglas had. Thomas was in shower and did not hear the scream but she was there and got him to calm down. She will not take Caroline's place but she can be Douglas's step-mom starting tomorrow. She goes even further by shocking Steffy when she asks her to be her matron of honor. She has done such a great job with the two girls and Liam and she wants to do the same with Douglas and still raise all of them being close. Steffy says of course, she will be honored. But when Steffy goes to attend to the girls, Liam begs her not to marry Thomas tomorrow. She is definitely not ready for this. Steffy brings Phoebe out for Hope to hold and she goes gaga over her as always. She tells Liam this is the reason that she has to marry Thomas and be Douglas's mother. She knows what she needs. He says he will never stop being protective of her because he will never stop loving her. So tell him what he needs to do. Being engaged to Thomas is one thing but being married tomorrow is a whole other world. If she is doing this because he moved in with Steffy, he could move out if that would help."

        "Hope: Hey. Where's douglas?",
        "Thomas: Hey. You, uh -- you caught me. Heh, I was, uh -- I was just checking under the bed, making sure there were no monsters.",
        "Hope: That's not funny. Don't joke about that. He was really upset last night, thinking he saw a ghost.",
        "Thomas: I know. I felt terrible that I didn't hear him screaming. [ Sighs ] But you were there. You made all the difference.",
        "Hope: He just wanted his mommy to hold him.",
        "Thomas: And you did. You held him. You know, you chased away the nightmares.",
        "Hope: Thomas, caroline is always going to be douglas' real mother.",
        "Thomas: Of course. Of course caroline will always be his mother. But... he's gone without a mother for what feels like so long, you know? But you're gonna change that. I was up all night thinking about it. You know, I-I was thinking about us. Thinking about you. Our wedding. I was also thinking maybe i should ask brooke and my dad if we can just have the celebration here at the house. It's douglas' family home now. I think he'd like it.",
        "Hope: So do I.",
        "Thomas: Yeah?",
        "Hope: It's a wonderful idea.",
        "Thomas: Got another idea, too. I was thinking, um... well, we could make it special for douglas, but not just him, but for his cousins, too. You know, uh, make the kids really happy. Have some balloons and some stuffed animals. A whole family celebration.",
        "Hope: I like it. Yeah. I-I -- I think it's nice. I think we should include the kids as much as possible.",
        "Thomas: Huh. I have some thoughts on my best man, too. Have you thought about your maid of honor?",
        "Hope: Yeah.",
        "Thomas: Who's the lucky lady?",
        "Hope: Um... let's talk about that when I get back.",
        "Thomas: Uh, where are you going?",
        "Hope: I texted liam. He's with steffy and the girls. And I think it's best if he hears the news about how soon our wedding is going to be from me.",
        "Steffy: What's that?",
        "Liam: A text from hope. She's coming over to talk to us. I wonder what's up?",
        "Ridge: When did this happen?",
        "Eric: Last night. Xander called me at the house and said he had to leave right away.",
        "Brooke: Is somebody ill in his family? Is that why?",
        "Eric: He didn't say. Just that he had no alternative but to go.",
        "Ridge: No alternative? Why? I thought he liked it here at forrester.",
        "Quinn: Maybe he and zoe are having some problems.",
        "Eric: Could be. I doubt we'll ever know the reason he left.",
        "Quinn: Hmmm.",
        "Ridge: Hey.",
        "Thomas: Great! You're all here. Hey.",
        "Eric: Hi. How you doing?",
        "Thomas: Good. Hey, how are you?",
        "Quinn: Hello. [ Chuckles ]",
        "Thomas: Oh, thank for coming on such short notice.",
        "Quinn: Yeah, well, you didn't really give us much choice. I think your exact word were \"meet us at dad and brooke's or else.\"",
        "Eric: [ Chuckles ] Yeah.",
        "Ridge: So, what's going on? What's the big mystery?",
        "Eric: Yeah, and speaking of that, where is this beautiful fianc\u00e9e of yours?",
        "Quinn: Yes! We haven't been able to congratulate hope since you two got engaged.",
        "Thomas: Well, I'll get to that. But I have some, uh, big news to share. Last night, uh, hope asked if we could have the wedding as soon as possible. She's as anxious to do this as I am.",
        "Hope: Hi. I didn't want to knock or ring the doorbell in case the girls were sleeping. I hope that's okay.",
        "Liam: Of course it's okay. Hi.",
        "Steffy: Hope, I haven't gotten to congratulate you on your engagement.",
        "Hope: Thank you.",
        "Steffy: I know how devoted thomas is to you. I'm so happy for you. I know douglas is, too. So, have you set a date?",
        "Hope: Yes, actually. That's why I'm here.",
        "Steffy: Will it be soon?",
        "Hope: Tomorrow. In my line of work,",
        "Brooke: [ Sighs ] I don't understand this. I thought that hope wanted to take some time. And now you're telling us that...?",
        "Thomas: It was douglas' nightmare, okay? It reinforced to hope how important having the whole family together would be. Look [Sighs] If you'd seen douglas and how frightened he was...",
        "Brooke: All children have nightmares, thomas.",
        "Thomas: Not like this, okay? This is worse than I've ever seen it before. But hope, she was there for him. She's always there for him.",
        "Brooke: Of course. She's always going to be there for him. She loves douglas. But that doesn't mean you need to rush this wedding.",
        "Ridge: Okay. This is what hope wants.",
        "Thomas: Ask her, brooke. She'll tell you. I didn't pressure her in any way.",
        "Quinn: Where's the ceremony going to be?",
        "Eric: Yeah, we're always up for hosting another family wedding.",
        "Thomas: Heh. Well, thanks, granddad. That's really kind of both of you. Um, but, actually, I was thinking that, well, it'd be great for -- for hope and -- and me and especially douglas if we could have the ceremony here. This is home for douglas, and this is where he feels safe and the most love.",
        "Ridge: Of course. Yeah. Of course we're gonna host it here. Yes, we will.",
        "Thomas: Even if it's tomorrow?",
        "Brooke: Tomorrow?",
        "Ridge: He -- he did say it was right away.",
        "Brooke: [ Scoffs ] Well, at least we could have a week or two.",
        "Eric: Have you told douglas?",
        "Thomas: Hey, buddy!",
        "Eric: Hey, there you are!",
        "Thomas: [ Grunts ] Look who is here.",
        "Eric: Wow! Wow! I haven't seen you for so long. You get bigger every time I see you. [ Laughter ] Mwah!",
        "Ridge: Great.",
        "Quinn: Your dad was just telling us the big news about him and hope getting married tomorrow.",
        "Douglas: I can't wait for hope to be my new mommy.",
        "Thomas: [ Chuckles ] Well, you know, uh, speaking of which, do you know what a best man is?",
        "Douglas: No.",
        "Thomas: Okay. Well, at a wedding, there's a groom -- that's me -- and he gets to pick someone, someone who's really special to him, like a family friend or a relative, and that person stays with him through the whole ceremony. It's -- it's actually a really big honor.",
        "Douglas: Are you gonna ask grandpa to be your best man?",
        "Thomas: Well, normally, I would. But I was thinking about how important you've been in my relationship with hope. So I'd love it if you'd be my best man. Would you like that?",
        "Douglas: Yeah!",
        "Thomas: Yeah? I think hope would like that a lot, too.",
        "Liam: Tomorrow? Why? What happened?",
        "Hope: Douglas had a really bad nightmare last night, and he woke up scared to death.",
        "Liam: Okay. I'm sorry to hear that. What does that have to do with you moving up the wedding?",
        "Hope: Well, we all know douglas has been struggling since the loss of caroline. And, yes, he has been doing a little better, but he still has that giant hole in his life where a mother should be. And after last night, seeing him that way, it's clear that -- that he needs a mother.",
        "Liam: Where was thomas? Where was he in all this?",
        "Hope: He was in the shower, and the water was running, so he couldn't hear anything at first.",
        "Steffy: But you did.",
        "Hope: Yeah. I tried to go and comfort him, and let him know that everything was gonna be okay. I just want everything to be all right for him, and I know that i can help him get there.",
        "Liam: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I don't understand why you're in a rush to -- to go down the aisle. I don't get that. This is thomas' idea, wasn't it?",
        "Hope: It was mine. And I know, liam, you think thomas is using douglas to manipulate me, but there was nothing fake about douglas' fear last night, or his need for me to be a mother.",
        "Steffy: You don't have to say anything. Douglas is lucky to have you in his life.",
        "Steffy: Okay. So, about the wedding. Is there anything that you need? Anything at all?",
        "Hope: Actually... I was wondering if you would like to be my maid of honor? I admire you, steffy, for many reasons. But especially because you've been able to build such a loving home for phoebe and kelly... and liam. And I'm hoping to have that for douglas, too. Starting tomorrow. And I still would really like to raise our children together. Unify the families like we planned. So... please say yes.",
        "Steffy: Absolutely. I'd be honored.",
        "[ Baby crying ]",
        "Steffy: Sounds like someone's awake. I'll be right back.",
        "Liam: Hope, you got to listen to me. Ma-- [ Sighs ] I don't -- I don't -- how do I do this? Marrying thomas any sooner is not gonna change anything that matters about your relationship with douglas. It's -- it's not. It's not gonna make you more loving or more protective or more available. But it will lock the door behind you in an adult relationship that you are absolutely not ready for. Please do-- don't do this. Don't marry thomas tomorrow.",
        "Thomas: Well, I was thinking we could set up a few things outside -- maybe some games and a petting zoo.",
        "Eric: You can put pam and charlie out in the petting zoo.",
        "Thomas: That's actually a good idea. Yeah, and then afterwards you and your cousins can go out there, and you can have a blast. Yeah?",
        "Douglas: Yeah!",
        "Thomas: Yeah!",
        "Quinn: [ Chuckles ]",
        "Eric: I think this best man's pretty excited about this whole thing.",
        "Quinn: Aww. I think it's very sweet how you're including douglas and the girls in your wedding.",
        "Ridge: I agree. It was a-a long journey back for everybody after beth died. Especially hope. Nobody, no mother should ever know what it's like not to be able to hold your kid again. Watch her grow up. Anyway, I -- I have to think that tomorrow is -- is, um -- it's gonna be good. It's gonna be a new beginning for all of us. Especially hope.",
        "Hope: Mwah! [ Gasps ] Mwah! [ Giggles ] Ow! Oh! Oh. [ Smooching ] Hey, little angel. Yes. Oh, I'm so happy to see you.",
        "Steffy: I'm gonna check on kelly, see if she's up.",
        "Hope: This is why I have to take this path with thomas. When I hold phoebe, deep down inside, I still feel like I'm meant to be a mother. And I need to end the pull i feel to another woman's child. Look, I know it's probably because she was born around the same time as beth, and -- and she's a logan, but it's not right, what I feel for steffy's daughter. Especially when there is a young boy who does need me. And I can be a mom to him. And that's been made... it's been made very clear to me, especially after last night. I know you don't trust thomas. And I know you want me to wait. But, liam, I -- I know what I need to do. I'm just a normal person",
        "Eric: Brooke, I know what you're thinking. A wedding in this house in 24 hours? So much to do. How's it ever gonna get done?",
        "Quinn: Oh, eric, it's not the first spur-of-the-moment wedding we've put on. It'll come off without a hitch. Don't worry, brooke. Let's go.",
        "Eric: Okay.",
        "Brooke: Thanks.",
        "Ridge: See you guys.",
        "Quinn: Bye.",
        "Brooke: Bye.",
        "Ridge: I want hope and thomas to have a day that they will never forget. And I think making this about the kids is a really good start. What does my wife think?",
        "Brooke: You know how I feel. I wish I could be happy for thomas and hope. It's just... I can't help but believe he's manipulating hope into doing something that she's not ready to do, and he's using her maternal instincts for douglas to get what he wants. Ridge, I'm sorry. I really hate saying this. I -- I think that he has an agenda, and he's had one ever since he came back into los angeles. He wants hope, and he will stop at nothing to get her. And now, tomorrow, she's going to become his wife.",
        "Thomas: There's nothing stopping us, hope.",
        "Hope: Thomas, I'm -- I'm just not ready.",
        "Thomas: You're about to be my wife.",
        "Hope: I know. I -- I'm not sure when I'll be ready.",
        "Hope: I can't wait for our wedding night. I have to have you now, thomas. Now... and forever.",
        "Liam: Hope, I'm not -- I'm not trying to make this harder on you. But h-how do I accept this? I mean, you -- you being engaged to thomas is one thing. You marrying him tomorrow is -- is a whole other level. That's --",
        "Hope: I have explained why, and I wish you would respect my reasons.",
        "Liam: I respect your reasons. I know your re-- your reasons are coming from an honorable place. But I -- all right. I'm -- I'm just gonna say it. I don't think that you would be rushing into a marriage with thomas if it weren't for what happened the night of the party. And I am so sorry that I hurt you. Do you understand? I -- I'm sorry.",
        "Hope: You've already apologized.",
        "Liam: I know that. But if what happened between me and steffy is in any way... god! I don't -- I don't -- what do I do here? I don't know what to say here. Should I -- should I just move out? I mean, should I pack my bags and move out? I-is that's what's pushing you toward thomas? Tell -- tell me. What do I do?",
        "Hope: Liam, please. You and the girls, you're a family now. They're your life. And so is steffy. I know you love her.",
        "Liam: Doesn't mean I'm ever gonna stop feeling protective of you, because I'm never gonna stop loving you.",
        "Hope: [ Sobs quietly ] And I will always love you, too. Even when I'm getting married tomorrow. You're my true love. But being here like this, imagining the family we could have had, the future we could have had with our sweet little angel... [ Inhales sharply ] It's too painful. Beth was taken from us, and I have not been the same since. And that is why I need to marry thomas tomorrow. To fill that emptiness, that never-ending ache in my heart. [ Cries ] To be a mother to a child who really, truly needs me. And I wish we could have had that chance with beth. But we have to stop living in the past. Beth is lost to us. Forever. And I'll never be able to hold her again. So I have to let go. ."
