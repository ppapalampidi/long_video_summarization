        "As Ridge and RJ talk, Ridge urges him to do the right thing. RJ laments that if Ridge thinks Coco is innocent, then he would re-hire her. But he is asking her to tell the truth and put her sister in prison. He immediately calls Coco and asks her to come meet him at FC. She says they will not even let her in the door but he says yes they are expecting her now. As she speaks with Sally she says she trusted Sally but she never will be accepted by the Forrester's again. She is a Spectra, a knockoff artist pariah and that is all they ever will be. Sally swears that she has learned her lesson and never will do that again. She will make it up to Coco, she promises. Nothing will tear them apart. Shirley does not feel sorry for the Forrester's; they can afford it. Sally is afraid there might be a price to pay. Both Zende and Nicole are surprised that they want Coco to confess to her unwitting crime. Steffy says Sally deserves all that is coming.",

        "Ridge: Justice has to be served, R.J.",
        "R.J.: Yeah, yeah. I know. Spectra stole our designs.",
        "Steffy: Our entire collection.",
        "R.J.: Then go after spectra.",
        "Steffy: That's what we're doing. We're going after Sally spectra, but we need coco's help.",
        "R.J.: You want coco to rat out her sister.",
        "Ridge: We want her to tell the truth.",
        "R.J.: [Scoffs]",
        "Ridge: That Sally set her up with a hidden camera to steal our designs. And if she is who you say she is, she's gonna do it.",
        "R.J.: 15 years, dad. Seriously? You want coco to send her sister to prison for 15 years?",
        "Coco: Interesting piece.",
        "Sally: Coco.",
        "Coco: What's that? Another knockoff?",
        "Sally: No, no, this is a part of the, uh, next collection. The real collection.",
        "Coco: Ooh. The one you didn't steal?",
        "Sally: I am so happy to see you. I really didn't think I was going to after what I did. What have you been up to?",
        "Coco: Applying for jobs. You know, restaurants mostly, waiting tables and bussing and dishwashing. Really anything they ask of me. Except stealing.",
        "Zende: So, I was thinking we could check out that new Korean place. It's not gonna be as good as what we had the other night, considering I made it, right? Nicole?",
        "Nicole: Hmm?",
        "Zende: All right. My wife is way too quiet. What's going on?",
        "Nicole: Sorry. Just thinking about coco.",
        "Zende: Really?",
        "Nicole: Yes. I met up with her earlier. I wanted to check in.",
        "Zende: You guys are friends. That's cool. Doesn't change the fact that she's a spectra. She stole from us.",
        "Nicole: Coco was set up by her sister. You do realize that.",
        "Zende: That seems to be her story.",
        "Nicole: You seriously don't believe her?",
        "Zende: Maybe. Maybe not. Look, it doesn't matter at this point. The whole concept of a spectra working at Forrester is just ridiculous to me.",
        "Nicole: This has been really hard on her, Zende. She lost her job at Forrester. She won't work at spectra. I saw her apply for a job at Il Giardino.",
        "Zende: Well, there you go. I hope she gets it.",
        "Nicole: She's a good person, Zende. And I feel bad for her.",
        "Sally: Dishwashing? Really?",
        "Coco: Yeah, why not? It's honorable work.",
        "Sally: Yeah, I did it. I even liked it. Uh, but you belong in fashion.",
        "Coco: Yeah, well, Forrester's never gonna hire me back.",
        "Sally: Forget about Forrester, okay? We need you here.",
        "Coco: To lie and steal? No. No, I don't think so.",
        "Sally: Those days are over. I'm going legit.",
        "Coco: Mm-hmm.",
        "Sally: I mean it, coco. Our next collection will be designed in house.",
        "Coco: What about the Forresters? You stole from them, Sally. With zero accountability.",
        "Ridge: Yes, she could do some jail time, but that's up to a judge to decide. It's not our concern.",
        "Steffy: The point is, R.J., They broke the law. They really hurt us. There are repercussions.",
        "R.J.: What would coco have to do?",
        "Ridge: Tell the truth.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, like the rest of the spectra group.",
        "Ridge: And sign an affidavit.",
        "R.J.: She's sending her sister to prison.",
        "Ridge: She's righting a wrong. And she's gonna prove to us that she's trustworthy and that she's not like the rest of that family. That is what you want, isn't it, son?",
        "Ridge: If you want us to give coco the benefit of the doubt, this is the way to do it.",
        "Steffy: R.J., If coco is everything that you're claiming -- forthcoming and truthful -- then let her prove it. Ask her to come here and have her tell us the truth about Sally.",
        "R.J.: There has to be another way. Making coco betray her sister --",
        "Steffy: Sally betrayed coco.",
        "Ridge: All right. I know this is hard, son. But if we want spectra to pay for what they did, coco has to step up.",
        "R.J.: If she does what you said and she proved to you that she's honest, like I know she is, would you rehire her?",
        "Ridge: Give her a call, R.J. Let's do the right thing.",
        "Sally: I will make it up to you, coco, and to the Forresters.",
        "Coco: How are you gonna do that, Sally? Saul and grams are out there shipping orders.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Coco: You betrayed Thomas and R.J. and me.",
        "[Ringing continues]",
        "Coco: It's R.J.",
        "Sally: Answer it.",
        "Coco: I haven't talked to him since the fashion show.",
        "Sally: He cares about you, coco. Answer it.",
        "Coco: Hey, R.J.",
        "R.J.: Hey. Thanks for answering.",
        "Coco: Why are you calling?",
        "R.J.: It wasn't your fault, coco.",
        "Coco: R.J., please don't do this. I've caused so much trouble with you and your family, and -- and I'm ashamed, but there's nothing that I can do to make it up to you, so...",
        "R.J.: Maybe there's a way that you can help.",
        "Coco: What?",
        "R.J.: Meet me at Forrester.",
        "Coco: R.J.",
        "R.J.: Please. Just come over here.",
        "Coco: Your father will never let me in the building.",
        "R.J.: Yeah, he will. I'm with him now.",
        "Coco: Okay. Okay, I'll -- I'll head over now.",
        "R.J.: Okay. See ya. She's on her way.",
        "Coco: R.J. Wants me to go to Forrester.",
        "Sally: That's a good sign, right? It's the first step to forgiveness maybe.",
        "Coco: It was never about forgiveness, Sally. R.J. Always knew that I wasn't in on the plan to steal their designs.",
        "Sally: This is gonna work out for you.",
        "Coco: You really don't get it. I could never go back to R.J. His -- his family would never accept me in his life, and I can't come between them. It's just -- it's not gonna work out between us. And it was stupid to think it ever could. I'm a spectra. A pariah. And we steal and we cheat, and that's always how they're gonna see us.",
        "Sally: No, that is how they see me, not you, okay? It doesn't have to be that way. I'm not proud of what I've done, okay? I lost Thomas. I betrayed you.",
        "Coco: Yeah. Why? Why? How could you do that to me? I trusted you, Sally. And I never would have thought that you'd be capable of this.",
        "Sally: Look, okay, whether you believe it or not, I was thinking about you when I was doing this. I was, all right? This horrible situation that we're in and losing this building and aunt Sally's legacy and our employees and their families -- all of it, okay? It wasn't an excuse. And it's no justification for deceiving your sister, but... grams got in my head. She made some really valid points about how this could be good for everyone, all right? And if it's any consolation, I swear to you I will never do it again. I learned my lesson. But we're family, coco, and that is what is important. I know. Okay, I know. You're thinking what kind of person could do that to their sister. I know. I get it, all right? But I will make it up to you. I will. I swear. Nothing is gonna tear us apart.",
        "R.J.: Coco was used by her sister, and now we're gonna use her against her sister?",
        "Ridge: We need coco to prove that Sally stole from us. That's it.",
        "Steffy: And if she feels as badly as she says she does, an awareness of right and wrong, then you're gonna be able to get through to her.",
        "R.J.: Convince her to put her sister in prison.",
        "Shirley: Coco on the way to Forrester?",
        "Sally: Yes.",
        "Shirley: See how everything turns out?",
        "Sally: Actually, no, I don't.",
        "Shirley: Well, coco must be back in the fold. R.J. Convinced his dad that she's innocent. A win/win for everyone.",
        "Sally: Yeah, everyone except for the Forresters. We stole from them, grams.",
        "Shirley: We executed a business plan.",
        "Sally: At the expense of the Forresters.",
        "Shirley: Forrester can afford it.",
        "Sally: [Sighs] I just have to wonder.",
        "Shirley: Wonder what?",
        "Sally: If there isn't gonna be a price to pay.",
        "Zende: So carter thinks we might have a case against spectra.",
        "Ridge: Yeah, he kept digging, and we have a better case than we thought. Lieutenant baker agrees.",
        "Zende: Damn. That's some good news.",
        "Ridge: Mm-hmm.",
        "Steffy: We need to save all our original designs.",
        "Nicole: Has carter filed yet?",
        "Steffy: Not yet, no.",
        "Ridge: No, not yet. It's -- anything has to do with creative or design, it's a tough thing to prove, and we would have a better chance if we could get a confession from someone on the inside of spectra.",
        "Zende: Sounds like a pretty hard sell to me.",
        "Nicole: And who would do that for us?",
        "Steffy: We're hoping to convince coco.",
        "Nicole: You want coco to turn in her sister? Please stand by. Please stand by. Please stand by. Please stand by. Please stand by. Please stand by. Please stand by. Please stand by. Please stand by. Please stand by. Please stand by. Please stand by. Please stand by. Please stand by. Please stand by. Please stand by.",
        "R.J.: R.J. Just -- just the letters.",
        "Coco: Okay, I'm sorry.",
        "Pam: Coco.",
        "Coco: Hi, um, pam.",
        "Pam: You're here to see R.J.",
        "Coco: Yes.",
        "Pam: He's waiting for you in the design office.",
        "Coco: You wanted to see me?",
        "R.J.: Yeah, I wanted to see you.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "R.J.: Thank you for coming.",
        "Coco: Yeah, I was kind of surprised when you called. I-I wasn't really sure what it meant.",
        "R.J.: I miss you, coco.",
        "Coco: I miss you, too.",
        "R.J.: I sent you messages, texts.",
        "Coco: I know.",
        "R.J.: Why didn't you respond?",
        "Coco: I didn't think your family would appreciate that. I didn't want to cause more trouble than I already have.",
        "R.J.: You have not caused any trouble. You're innocent in all this.",
        "Coco: So how are things around here? Is any work getting done without my coffee runs?",
        "R.J.: [Chuckles]",
        "Coco: I'm really, really sorry, R.J., About the mess my family made of your life, of your company.",
        "R.J.: I'm not gonna lie. It's been a real blow. Months of work down the drain, cost us a fortune. It's not right.",
        "Coco: No. No, it's not.",
        "R.J.: But you weren't a part of that. You were set up. You were used.",
        "Coco: Yeah, I just -- I wish there was a way that your parents and everyone at Forrester could see that I'm -- I'm really sorry.",
        "R.J.: There's a way you can help.",
        "Coco: How?",
        "R.J.: By telling my whole family that you think what they did was wrong.",
        "Coco: R.J., I'd do that in a heartbeat. You know that. Just -- just tell me what I need to say.",
        "R.J.: The truth.",
        "Coco: Yes. Yes, absolutely. I'll tell the truth. I'll tell your whole family.",
        "R.J.: Would you say it to a judge? Make spectra pay for what they've done?",
        "Zende: So if Sally's indicted, what happens?",
        "Ridge: She could be sentenced to 15 years.",
        "Nicole: 15 years?",
        "Steffy: She deserves it!",
        "Nicole: Look, I'm not saying she doesn't. I'm not siding with the Spectras. They need to be punished. But to put coco in the middle of all this when she's the only one that didn't do --",
        "Steffy: We are asking her to do the right thing. Sally has been messing with me and the company for months. Food fights, crashing weddings. Fine, she calls that harmless promotion, but this? This was a criminal act. We have lost millions of dollars. Our resources, our energy, everything that we --",
        "Ridge: Okay. Okay. R.J. is talking to her right now.",
        "Zende: Well, hopefully he's trying to convince her to implicate her sister.",
        "Ridge: It's the only way we can get to Sally.",
        "Steffy: And Sally's got to pay for it.",
        "Shirley: Come on. Guilt is for those people who refuse to seize an opportunity. Here. Help me sort these invoices.",
        "Sally: I just don't know how I could have done it.",
        "Shirley: Done what?",
        "Sally: Betray coco that way. My god, what was I thinking?",
        "Shirley: You weren't. You were just reacting to a dire situation. And if you hadn't, this building would be a pile of bricks, and we'd be out on the street.",
        "Sally: I've just got to make it right.",
        "Shirley: Well, why don't you buy her something with all the money we've got coming in?",
        "Sally: I love her, grams, okay? I've done her wrong, and I'm going to fix it.",
        "Shirley: No, that goes in this pile over here. You know what? She's young. She loves you. She'll get over it. Just give her some time. [Sighs]",
        "Sally: You're right. We share a bond, and nothing can break it. We'll get through this.",
        "Coco: I'm not quite sure what you're asking me to do.",
        "R.J.: You want to help us rectify this, right?",
        "Coco: Yes. Yes, definitely. What my sister did was wrong.",
        "R.J.: And I told my dad that. Steffy, too.",
        "Coco: And they didn't believe you.",
        "R.J.: I wouldn't say that. They're coming around. I've been preaching nonstop.",
        "Coco: Thank you.",
        "R.J.: I'm just telling it like it is. I know you. You wouldn't do anything to hurt me or my family.",
        "Coco: How can I help?",
        "R.J.: Um... my dad and carter -- he's one of our attorneys.",
        "Coco: Mm-hmm.",
        "R.J.: They talked to a cop. Steffy was there, too. Lieutenant baker -- that's the cop -- he told us we might have a strong case against spectra.",
        "Coco: That doesn't surprise me.",
        "R.J.: But if we want a slam dunk, we need someone involved to confess, explain what happened, you know?",
        "Coco: Okay, and then that'd be me.",
        "R.J.: Yeah.",
        "Coco: All right, what -- what would I do?",
        "R.J.: Sign something -- court document.",
        "Coco: Court. Okay. Wow. So then your family would be, what, suing for damages?",
        "R.J.: Yeah.",
        "Coco: Well, I guess my sister's dream to bring spectra back is down the drain.",
        "R.J.: Are you okay with that?",
        "Coco: She's profiting off stolen goods.",
        "R.J.: So you'll do it?",
        "Coco: Yeah. Yeah, I'll do it. I think it's the right thing. And plus it might even help her with Thomas. If there's any chance between the two of them.",
        "R.J.: Um, there's more. There's a lawsuit for larceny and industrial espionage. Criminal charges.",
        "Coco: Criminal?",
        "R.J.: Sally could go to prison.",
        "Coco: Prison?",
        "R.J.: Yeah.",
        "Coco: For how long?",
        "R.J.: Up to 15 years.",
        "Coco: Look, I, uh... I would do anything for you, R.J. and I-I really want to make this right. But to go against my sister, to put my own sister behind bars? Is that what you want? You want me to put my own sister in prison?"
