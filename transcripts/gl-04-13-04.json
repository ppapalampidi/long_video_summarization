        "Marah: \"Gone to get breakfast. Telegram for you on the dresser. Shayne dropped it off. Be back before you could miss me.\" I can't believe this.",
        "Edmund: And one, two, three. Lunge. No, joey. Oh, sorry, tammy. Look, if you're going to stay on balance... I've got a couple of foils upstairs. If promise not to tell your mother I put you in mortal danger, we could use them.",
        "Joey: That'd be cool.",
        "Edmund: Great. Tammy, my sweet, my princess. I want you to write down all of juliet's thoughts for the second act in your journal, all right?",

        "Edmund: Thanks. Come, lads, put up your swords; you know not what you do.",
        "Lizzie: Hi. What, I don't even... I don't rate a hello anymore? You're made at me. Well, are you, tammy? Are you mad at me?",
        "Tammy: Of course I'm mad! Okay, but not just at you, lizzie. At myself, too. You know why? Because I was stupid enough to trust you again. You fed me that totally bogus story about wanting sam spencer's address so you could make amends with olivia. And like an idiot I believed you.",
        "Rick: Hello.",
        "Phillip: Hey. Come on in.",
        "Rick: Hello.",

        "Phillip: Oh. Oh, that's great. Hi, beautiful.",

        "Rick: Yeah.",
        "Phillip: You know what? You're going to get to go to ballet classes together, you're going to have sleepovers. I'm going to get them matching ponies so that they could ride together.",

        "Phillip: Yeah. Well, I'm just happy.",
        "Rick: Of course you are. Of course you are. Let's not get ahead of ourselves. I mean, you know, once you get out of this place then...",
        "Phillip: Now. Now. I'm ready to get out of here now.",
        "Rick: Did your doctor say that?",
        "Phillip: No, listen. That's what... you have to talk to these guys, because the doctors will listen to you. I want to get out of here now. I want to go home now. (Knock at the door)",
        "Alan: Hello.",
        "Olivia: Hi. What do you want?",
        "Alan: Well, we wanted to officially welcome emma to the family. And we bought her something.",
        "Olivia: Oh, yeah. You know, it's actually polite to call first. But I guess you were afraid that if I knew you were coming i would slam the door in your faces. (Laughter) kind of like this.",
        "Alan: Olivia, we have something important to say to you and I think you owe it to yourself and to emma to listen to what we have to say.",
        "Marah: Hey.",
        "Jeffrey: Good morning.",
        "Marah: Good morning.",
        "Jeffrey: Did you sleep well?",
        "Marah: Great. Until I realized you were gone. But now you're back and everything is wonderful.",
        "Jeffrey: Hmm. So you're not sick of me yet?",
        "Marah: Mm-mm.",
        "Jeffrey: That's good. Because I was thinking after breakfast today maybe we could, I don't know, spend the day together.",
        "Marah: Don't you have to work?",
        "Jeffrey: Work? What's that mean? That word is not in my vocabulary today.",
        "Marah: (Laughs) I like the sound of that.",
        "Jeffrey: I thought we could like go out to the lake. It's a beautiful day, take a drive, maybe have a little picnic out there. Everything's in bloom at the botanical gardens. We can out there if you'd like. Have dinner after that.",
        "Marah: That all sounds really wonderful. But actually there's something that I would rather do, somewhere I'd rather go.",
        "Jeffrey: Sure. Whatever. Whatever you want. Where?",
        "Marah: Paris.",
        "Lizzie: Tammy, I did not plan on taking the baby. I didn't!",
        "Tammy: She tells yet another lie.",
        "Lizzie: Tammy, I am telling you the truth. Okay, so I did not go over there planning on making nice with olivia. But I knew she was hiding something and I had to find out what it was. And when that it was my little sister, I... I just picked her up and the next thing I knew we were out the door.",
        "Tammy: But that's even worse than planning it, lizzie. That means you're like totally out of control.",
        "Lizzie: I'm not out of control.",
        "Tammy: No one just takes a baby. So either you've lost it completely, or you did it to get back at olivia.",
        "Lizzie: Why would I want to get back at olivia?",
        "Tammy: Because you hate her for marrying your dad.",
        "Olivia: Actually, alan, i think I owe to my daughter to keep her as far away from you and your family as I possibly can.",
        "Alan: But emma's family is our family. Now I know you don't like that fact, but you can't ignore it.",
        "Olivia: Want to bet?",
        "Alan: You don't plan on keeping her away from us her entire life, do you?",
        "Alexandra: Come on. Really, olivia, that's reasonable. I mean when phillip gets out of the hospital, he's going to want us to get to know emma and visa versa. He wants it now.",
        "Alan: Yes. You can't raise her in a vacuum. I mean she has other siblings she needs to know. That has the right know. Plus emma deserves to be around a loving and nurturing family like we are.",
        "Olivia: Just for awhile. That's it.",
        "Alan: Good.",
        "Olivia: Well, eama just woke up from her nap. I'll go get her.",
        "Alan: Great, great, great, great.",
        "Alexandra: Well, what do you think? Did she rent this furniture or just pick it up off the street?",
        "Alan: Alexandra, you agreed.",
        "Alexandra: Exactly. I know exactly what to say.",
        "Alan: This is for phillip. We haven't been able to help him in the past few months. But this is something we can do for him.",
        "Rick: Phillip, I'm sorry to take the baby. So what's going on with you, phillip?",
        "Phillip: What do you mean?",
        "Rick: What's going on with you? Where did all of this energy come from? Your medication was suppose to curb that. Phillip, you are taking the medication, right? Phillip.",
        "Phillip: Where is it?",
        "Rick: Where... where is what?",
        "Phillip: An envelope full of pictures of emma that I wanted to show to you and I just can't remember where... where I...",
        "Rick: Calm down. Phillip, calm down.",
        "Phillip: Damn it! Where is my briefcase?",
        "Rick: It's right over...",
        "Phillip: Where is it?",
        "Rick: I'll get it, okay.",
        "Phillip: Oh, oh. No, no, no. That's okay. I got it.",
        "Rick: Phillip, no. Listen to me.",
        "Phillip: No, no, no. No, I got it.",
        "Rick: Relax. Relax, okay?",
        "Phillip: No. It's my briefcase. I know where they are.",
        "Rick: I'm sure I can find it. Just calm down and relax.",
        "Phillip: I'm perfectly fine. I just don't know why you don't want me to...",
        "Rick: See. Here. Here's the pictures.",
        "Phillip: Okay.",
        "Rick: See.",
        "Phillip: Okay, okay. Good.",
        "Rick: What's wrong with you? What is it?",
        "Phillip: Nothing.",
        "Jeffrey: Paris.",
        "Marah: Yes.",
        "Jeffrey: You just said paris.",
        "Marah: Mm-hmm.",
        "Jeffrey: Paris, france. You want to go to paris.",
        "Marah: Yeah. The day after tomorrow.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, hang on.",
        "Marah: (Laughs)",
        "Jeffrey: You don't feel warm. Are you sure you're all right?",
        "Marah: The telegram that shayne brought over. It's good news. My... I sent my portfolio to my cousin mindy in paris a couple months ago, the fashion designer.",
        "Jeffrey: Right. And so the telegrams from her.",
        "Marah: Yes. And she sent my portfolio to one of the biggest fashion houses in paris. And guess what?",
        "Jeffrey: What?",
        "Marah: They loved me!",
        "Jeffrey: Oh, my god. That's great.",
        "Marah: They love me. And they want to meet me. And can you believe it?",
        "Jeffrey: Of course I believe it, marah. You're an incredible talent. I mean you're incredible period.",
        "Marah: Do you know what this means? If they sign me then I worked with a french designer. That is a major, major career move. Which is why I'm trying not to get too excited about it.",
        "Jeffrey: No, no...",
        "Marah: Because I'm sure they look at dozens of portfolios.",
        "Jeffrey: Get excited, marah. This is fantastic!",
        "Marah: (Screams)",
        "Jeffrey: After all that you've been through the last couple of months, you deserve something really good in your life.",
        "Marah: Oh, I have something really good in my life. I've got you.",
        "Jeffrey: Besides me.",
        "Marah: I don't know. I'm almost afraid to say it, but I feel like my prayers have finally been answered. Like... like this is a sign, you know, that life goes on. And I'm not crazy to have hope again, you know.",
        "Jeffrey: It's not crazy, darling.",
        "Marah: So... so you think that I should take them up on their offer and I should go to paris?",
        "Jeffrey: Let me think. Yeah! Absolutely yes. I mean you'd be a fool not to.",
        "Marah: All right, well, then I may be a fool, because there's only one way that I'm going to paris and that's if you come with me.",
        "Lizzie: Look, tammy, I don't hate olivia, okay? I just wanted to bring emma to my dad so that he could get to know her a little bit and spend some time with her. That's all I wanted. Okay, you're right. You know, I do things without thinking and that worries sometimes. But I just can't stop it, tammy. Okay, I did use you. And I was wrong. And I'm really sorry.",
        "Tammy: Till the next time. And don't say there won't be a next time, because you basically just told me there will be. Lizzie, I have cut you a lot of slack recently and you haven't been a friend in return. All you do is gripe about olivia then you turn ouound and act just like her.",
        ">Lelexandra: Oh. Oh, olivia, I don't know how you managed to do it.",
        "Olivia: Do what?",
        "Alexandra: Well, I mean keeping this precious little angel a secret for al of those months. (Laughs) oh, look at you, sweetheart.",
        "Alan: Look at that. Look at that.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, she were mine I'd be dying to take her out in public and show her off.",
        "Olivia: It would have been nice. I just had to put her safety first.",
        "Alexandra: Well, of course, of course, of course. Now that the secrets out, you know, you can take her out and introduce your little emma to all your friends. Oh, she's probably going to enjoy cassie's children a whole lot, you know. It's very important for their development, you know, to have their socialization. (Laughs)",
        "Alan: Absolutely. Alexander's right about that.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, absolutely.",
        "Alan: Yes, yes.",
        "Alexandra: Maybe you will take her to the park. (Laughs) oh, all those events and those classes. Like every mother should spend all that kind of private time with their child.",
        "Olivia: Yeah, you know, it's going to be really nice to take her places.",
        "Alexandra: Of course, it's su a a long way out here, you know. I don't know. Maybe you're thinking about moving back to the beacon. I mean it's so much more comfortable there for you I'm sure. But then again it's just a hotel. Oh, a baby needs a real, real home. But I'm rere you're going to work that all out just fine. Oh, look at you. Oh, are you precious or what? Look she's got phillip's nose, don't you think?",
        "Alan: Yes, she does.",
        "Olivia: Oh, yes. No, it's definitely phillip's nose.",
        "Alexandra: Look at that.",
        "Alan: And I think she has elizabeth's smile. (Baby crying)",
        "Olivia: You know what? It's time for her feeding. Come on, sweetheart, that's what she wants.",
        "Alan: Well, she does sound a little hungry.",
        "Olivia: Yes, she's hungry. Come here. It's okay. Oh, thank you very much for the gift. It's okay. Where's that blanket?",
        "Alexandra: Well, don't you want to open it?",
        "Olivia: No, I'm sure whatever it is, it's lovely. Baby, it's okay.",
        "Alan: We don'T... we don't mind waiting till after emma's fed.",
        "Olivia: Yeah, well, you don't, but I do. Emma say good bye to your grandpa alan and your auntie alex, okay.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, bye-bye, sweetheart.",
        "Alan: Right. Right. We are emma's family, olivia. And I think deep down inside of you, you know it would not be right to keep her away from us.",
        "Olivia: All right. You came here for a reason. Spit it out.",
        "Rick: Well?",
        "Phillip: I don't know.",
        "Rick: You're not taking your medication are you? Why would you do that?",
        "Phillip: Because I can't stand the way it makes me feel. I can't concentrate. I start a sentence and I'm so tired, I can't finish it. All I want to do is sleep.",
        "Rick: Look I know this is frustrating for you right now.",
        "Phillip: Frustrating, rick.",
        "Rick: But you have to give this some time.",
        "Phillip: No, it's a whole lot more than frustrating.",
        "Rick: There are a lot of options that we could discuss, phillip, okay. But going cold turkey, off your medication is not one of them right now.",
        "Phillip: But, rick... but i feel five hundred percent better when I don't take it. Everything is crisp and clear. I have energy. I can focus.",
        "Rick: You're bouncing off the walls.",
        "Phillip: No, I'm not. I'm really not.",
        "Rick: Phillip, you're maniac right now. Look at yourself. Your breathing is shallow and rapid, your pupils are dilated. Can't you see that?",
        "Phillip: But I feel fine, rick. My head... in my head I feel fine, okay. Look I just... I just want to be with my daughter, all right. I just... I want to get out of here and I want to be with my little girl. I have... I've have like... I've had two hours with her max since I first saw her. And that's not right. Right?",
        "Rick: No, it's not right.",
        "Phillip: And lizzie needs me. And my boys need me. And I got to get out of here, rick. I can'T... I can't stay locked up in here anymore. I feel like... I'm like a lion at the zoo. I'm pacing back and forth and back and forth. And I...",
        "Rick: I understand that. I do. I do understand.",
        "Phillip: Okay. Then help me.",
        "Rick: I...",
        "Phillip: Please! Help me get out of here.",
        "Rick: Phillip, if I thought the best thing for you to do would be go home right now, i would do it in a heartbeat. You know that. You're not ready to go home yet, phillip. You're not. You've got to stick with the medication and stabilize first. And then, phillip, the next step is for you to go home. And to readjust your life outside of this place. But you've got to get well first, buddy. Don't you see that?",
        "Phillip: And how long do you figure that'll take, rick? Another couple of years?",
        "Rick: What? What are you talking about?",
        "Phillip: Miserable little... she got to you, too, didn't she? Somehow she got to you, too.",
        "Rick: What? What do you mean who got to me? What are you talking about?",
        "Phillip: Olivia has been scheming to keep me in here. And somehow she got you to help her. She got to you. She got to you, too!",
        "Jeffrey: Marah, I would love to go to paris. I really would. It's just that, you know, I...",
        "Marah: What? What, you have to work? Well, you were going to take today off and blow off work. What's a couple more days? Come on, you're suppose to be mr. Spontaneity, live in the moment, get pleasure out of whatever you can. How come you're like that with everyone but me?",
        "Jeffrey: That's true, isn't it? I have been very cautious with you.",
        "Marah: Right. Because you didn't want to hurt me. And I completely understand that, but we're past that now. We've been through so much. And you need a break. I need a break. Don't you want a break?",
        "Jeffrey: Yes, I do.",
        "Marah: Come on, I just don't want to think about carrie anymore. I don't want to think about what she did and what I did, and people gossiping about us. I just want to go far, far away with you and enjoy it where it's simple and uncomplicated.",
        "Jeffrey: Do you know how tempting that sounds?",
        "Marah: Then do it. Come on. It's only a few days. Please. Please say yes. Please, please.",
        "Jeffrey: I haven'T... look at you. I haven't seen you this happy in so long.",
        "Marah: Yes?",
        "Jeffrey: How can I refuse?",
        "Marah: (Screams) did you just say that you're going to go paris with me?",
        "Jeffrey: Yes, yes. Let's do it. The sooner the better. Wee. Wee, mademoiselle.",
        "Lizzie: Talk about a low blow. That is by far the meanest thing you have ever said to me, tammy. That I'm like olivia?! I am nothing like her, okay?",
        "Edmund: Yes, you are. Like shakespeare's olivia. 'Tis beauty truly bent, whose red and white natures own sweet and cunning hand laid on.",
        "Lizzie: At least someone doesn't think I'm completely crazy.",
        "Tammy: I didn't say that. It's just that there's nothing you could say that could possibly make what you did okay.",
        "Lizzie: Are you enjoying yourself, tammy? Are you? I bet you just love feeling superior to me, don't you?",
        "Tammy: Oh, here we go.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, because your family just so perfect, isn't it?",
        "Tammy: It's excuse time again.",
        "Lizzie: No, no, no. Really. Your family's great and mine's stinks, doesn't it?",
        "Edmund: Girls...",
        "Tammy: No. I want to get you.",
        "Edmund: Hey, hey, hey...",
        "Lizzie: Stop it.",
        "Edmund: Let go.",
        "Tammy: She thinks that i don't have any problems. I spent months in foster care when I was little. My dad was such a loser that my mom had to raise me all on her and the state nearly took me away from her. Then she finally met a perfect guy, a prince literally. Then he was killed in a car crash.",
        "Edmund: I know, honey.",
        "Tammy: Sometimes I miss him so much.",
        "Edmund: I know.",
        "Lizzie: Stop it! Look tammy looks down on me because her life is so great.",
        "Joey: No one's family is perfect, lizzie. Everyone has their own troubles!",
        "Lizzie: Joey her life is great. She's got a cute boyfriend. She's got a lead in the school play. And what do I have? I've got a messed up family and nobody wants to fix it except for me.",
        "Olivia: Why are you really here?",
        "Alan: Olivia, we told you, we just wanted to welcome emma to the family. That's all.",
        "Olivia: Hmm. And?",
        "Alexandra: Oh, and nothing, really. We want make certain that we... we will enjoy the privilege of visiting emma regularly.",
        "Alan: It's what phillip wants.",
        "Olivia: Is that right?",
        "Alan: Yes. And it's what I want. I mean I want to get to know emma the same way as I know james and zach. I mean it's no difference. Olivi w well, and lizzie. Don't forget lizzie, the one who kidnapped my baby.",
        "Alan: Well, elizabeth did something very bad. But now she did it for a right reason.",
        "Olivia: Oh, please.",
        "Alexandra: Come on, it's true. She knew how much good it would do phillip to see emma.",
        "Alan: I don't think it benefits any of us to harp on this any further. I think that we're all trying to move past it, all right.",
        "Olivia: She knew that taking emma would be the worse thing she could do to me. How am I going to get passed this?",
        "Alexandra: All right, all right. The way I see it is just the more time we all spend together, the more time phillip spends with emma, the more time all of us spend together on a positive note. Well, lizzie will start to think of emma as her sister.",
        "Alan: Yes. Yes.",
        "Alexandra: Oh, come on. What can it hurt? I mean we could give it a try. If it doesn't work so be it. But I'm telling you, I am sure that it will work. What's the down side? What can we lose?",
        "Olivia: What I'll do is this. We'll try and spend a little time together, all right? Just baby steps and see what happens, okay.",
        "Alan: Excellent. I'll have thomas come over tomorrow and help you pack your things.",
        "Olivia: Pack my things? What are you talking about?",
        "Alan: Well, I mean we just agreed that you and emma would be moving back into the mansion with us.",
        "Phillip: So how did she do it, rick? What did olivia promise you? What... what did... what did olivia do for you to get you to turn against me, huh?",
        "Rick: I have not turned against you.",
        "Phillip: I don't believe this.",
        "Rick: Stop. Now stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Think about this. Take a deep breath and think about what you're saying, because you are not making any sense. You're acting totally paranoid right now.",
        "Phillip: Oh, yeah.",
        "Rick: Yes, paranoid. Which is what happens when you stop taking your medication like that cold turkey.",
        "Phillip: I'm not paranoid.",
        "Rick: No, you're not.",
        "Phillip: No.",
        "Rick: All right. Do you really believe that these doctors are keeping you here against your will? Do you? And olivia. Why would olivia not want you to feel better, phillip? Why?",
        "Phillip: That's a very good question, rick. And when I figure out exactly what it is she's after, you'll be the first to know.",
        "Rick: Now wait. Let's just... let's just calm down and talk this out, okay. All right. Okay? All right, phillip, what is really going on here? What got you upset that you start concocting all these wild stories? What happened? What is it?",
        "Phillip: I just want to get out of here.",
        "Rick: Okay. You don't trust olivia; I know you don'T. But do you trust me? Do you trust me? I have been your best friend for how many years now, pal? Has there ever been a single moment in your life when you needed me that I ever let you down? Ever? I'm sorry, I didn't hear you?",
        "Phillip: No, rick, you have never let me down. You never let me down.",
        "Rick: I know. I know. We're best frien, , phillip. I love you. I love you like a brother. And I want what's best for you. Don't you see that? Okay.",
        "Phillip: Okay.",
        "Rick: I know. But I'm also a doctor. Now listen to me. I'm also a doctor. And I know what I'm talking about when I tell you, you got to stay with this medication, okay?",
        "Phillip: Yes.",
        "Rick: Yes.",
        "Phillip: Yes.",
        "Rick: Phillip, listen to me. Now you've got to stick thth this program, all right? You have to. Because you want to feel better, right? You want to feel better.",
        "Phillip: Yes.",
        "Rick: Right? Isn't that the goal here?",
        "Phillip: Ah-huh.",
        "Rick: Right? Don't you want to feel better? Okay. All right. So we're going to make each other a promise right now, okay?",
        "Phillip: Ah-huh.",
        "Rick: All right. You promise me that you're going to keep taking these pills like you're suppose to, all right. For two weeks. In two weeks if you're not feeling better, then you don't have to take anymore. And I will do everything I can to get you out. Anything and everything. Because I love you and you're my best friend. Okay, do we have ourselves a deal? Do we?",
        "Phillip: I just want to go home.",
        "Rick: I know you do.",
        "Phillip: I just want to go.",
        "Rick: I know. So you've got to agree with this. It's only way that you'll be able to go home, okay? Do you trust me?",
        "Phillip: I trust you.",
        "Rick: Okay.",
        "Phillip: I have to trust you.",
        "Rick: Good. You have to trust me, okay?",
        "Edmund: Thank you. So how's it going?",
        "Joey: Lizzie's going to be fine. She just needed someone to listen to her.",
        "Edmund: All right, tammy just needed to vent.",
        "Joey: Right.",
        "Tammy: Sorry I got so upset earlier. I just want lizzie to stop making excuses. I mean, my life is not perfect either, but I try to keep it under control.",
        "Edmund: And I think you do a very, very good job, especially for just a wonderful young lady.",
        "Lizzie: What did I do that was so terrible?",
        "Joey: You kidnapped a baby.",
        "Lizzie: No. No, what I did was go see my little half sister, all right, and bring her to my dad so he could spend some time with her.",
        "Joey: Well, you should have told someone first. Olivia was really upset.",
        "Lizzie: Joey, it was all just a big misunderstanding. Everything was fine in the end, okay? I just want us all to be a family again.",
        "Olivia: Move in with you? Are you kidding me? Have you lost your mind?",
        "Alan: Olivia, you just agreed that you would try.",
        "Olivia: I didn't agree to move in with you. I agreed that we could spend time together. How could you possibly construe that to mean that I'd be willing to move my daughter into that hornet's nest you call a home?",
        "Alexandra: Because, olivia, it's the right thing to do.",
        "Alan: Yes. And an ideal world for a child is to be surrounded by a family.",
        "Olivia: This is not an ideal world. This is a world where your other precious granddaughter is a raging psychopath with zero impulse control. Don't you get it? I'm scared to death to set foot in that house, let alone move my daughter in there.",
        "Alan: I think elizabethh would have trouble with her impulses no matter where she lives.",
        "Olivia: Are you trying to make me feel better?",
        "Alan: Did you ever hear the adage \"keep your enemies close\"? I mean, if you're afraid of elizabeth's attitude toward emma, don't you think it makes sense to keep her in a place where you can watch her?",
        "Alexandra: Oh, come on, please. I mean, between the three of us and beth and lillian and the servants, we can make certain that lizzie spends no private time, no time alone with emma.",
        "Alan: Yes, she'll still be in the same house with her. She'll see her every day. As a matter of fact, she will learn to adore her. How coulshshe not love emma?",
        "Olivia: Because elizabeth is insane.",
        "Alexandra: All right, the basic problem with elizabeth has been the fact... well, she feels threatened by you. I mean, the more she's around you, the less she's going to feel threatened.",
        "Olivia: You know, if emma and I move into the mansion, lizzie won't be the only one living under a microscope. The two of you will be as well.",
        "Alexandra: Us?",
        "Olivia: Yeah. So if there's more to this offer than you're letting on, if there's some ulterior motive, once I move into the house, i would figure it out, and i probably wouldn't be happy. And I can guarantee you phillip wouldn't either.",
        "Alan: I can assure you there is no ulterior motive. This offer is coming straight from the heart.",
        "Olivia: I'd have conditions.",
        "Alan: All right, name them.",
        "Olivia: Well, first of all, i want the big room overlooking the garden upstairs.",
        "Alexandra: That's my room.",
        "Olivia: But it has a small room next to it that would be perfect for a nursery, a nursery that I would want outfitted with security cameras monitored 24 hours a day. And lizzie would not be allowed to be alone with emma in that room or any other room in the house, ever.",
        "Alan: Agreed.",
        "Alexandra: Well, my room though...",
        "Alan: Agreed. Anything else?",
        "Olivia: If I feel the least bit uneasy about any of this, I'm taking emma and I'm moving out. And if you try to stop me, or if you try to keep her there without me...",
        "Alan: I will have thomas come over tomorrow and help you collect your things.",
        "Alexandra: Well, we'd better get out of here and let you start your packing.",
        "Alan: Yes, yes.",
        "Alexandra: Please kiss emma good-bye for me, will you?",
        "Alan: Olivia, you have made the right choice. There's no way you will regret it.",
        "Olivia: No, I won'T.",
        "Marah: Say it again.",
        "Jeffrey: Again.",
        "Marah: Again.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay. (Speaking in french)",
        "Marah: (Laughs)",
        "Jeffrey: We are going together to paris.",
        "Marah: We're going to walk along the banks of the seine.",
        "Jeffrey: Mm.",
        "Marah: Share a bottle of wine at an outdoor cafe. It sounds so perfect.",
        "Jeffrey: It will be. You know, let me take care of the travel arrangements, okay?",
        "Marah: You'd do that? You don't mind?",
        "Jeffrey: Not only do I not mind, I insist. This is an important trip for you, okay? I want it to go as smoothly as possible. You just concentrate on preparing for that meeting, all right? And let me take care of the rest.",
        "Marah: Thank you. That would be awesome.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay. Don't thank me.",
        "Marah: (Laughs)",
        "Jeffrey: Don't thank me. This will be a pleasure.",
        "Rick: So what do you say? You'll start taking your medication again?",
        "Phillip: I really want to go home, rick.",
        "Rick: I know you do, buddy.",
        "Phillip: No, you don't understand. Before, when I first came here, I didn't care. I was so deep in this hole, in this dark, dark place, that i didn't care. I couldn't see my way past it to ever think that I would want to live again, or that I'd have anything to live for. But I do now. I do. Daughter that I want to get to know and show her how much i love her. And lizzie and my boys, I've got so much that I have to make up to them. I want to... I want to be myself again. I want to have my life back again.",
        "Rick: Great, great. I'm so glad to hear you say that.",
        "Phillip: I do.",
        "Rick: I know you do. And for the longest time, I just didn't think you had the will to do that, but you do.",
        "Phillip: I know. But that's what I'm telling you. I really do.",
        "Rick: Right.",
        "Phillip: But that's why I'm afraid to start taking those pills again.",
        "Rick: No.",
        "Phillip: Because I know I'm a little intense right now. Listen, I know, I know. But I'm afraid if I start taking the pills again I'm going to go back into that dark, depressed place, and I'm going to lose that fight. I'm going to lose that will. And... and... I could stay in here forever, rick, and that'll kill me.",
        "Rick: No. You...",
        "Phillip: No, listen to me. Listen to me, rick. I'll die. I will die in here if I stay in here.",
        "Rick: Do you trust me? I'm your best friend. I will not let that happen to you, okay? Okay? Promise.",
        "Phillip: I'm going to do what you're asking me to do. But you have to take care of me, okay?",
        "Rick: I will.",
        "Phillip: Don't let me slip down into that place again.",
        "Rick: All right.",
        "Phillip: Okay.",
        "Rick: All right.",
        "Phillip: I'M... I'm trusting you.",
        "Rick: All right. Okay. Look, I'm just going to fill this out here, okay. There might be something else that we can try, okay. It's an entirely kind of different therapy.",
        "Phillip: What? What is it?",
        "Rick: You wouldn't have to take these drugs again. It's called electro convulsive therapy. It's called ect.",
        "Phillip: Mm-hmm.",
        "Rick: Now, I'm sure that langham is aware of it.",
        "Phillip: Right.",
        "Rick: So there has to be some reason why he hasn't brought it up to you.",
        "Phillip: Well, but if I did that, would I be able to get out of here?",
        "Rick: It has a very good success rate. But you have to be the right candidate, and only langham would know that. Wait, wait, wait. Let's do this. Let me call him, and you guys can set something up and see if you're the right candidate for it.",
        "Phillip: Yeah, do it. Do it. Do it.",
        "Rick: All right. Okay.",
        "Phillip: Yes.",
        "Rick: All right. Now, what I'll do is... don't get your hopes up. You might not be the right candidate for this. That's what I'm saying.",
        "Phillip: No, no, no. Listen. You do it, okay? And I don't care.",
        "Rick: All right.",
        "Phillip: You just talk to him. Talk to him about it today, okay?",
        "Rick: All right.",
        "Phillip: And don't say anything to anybody else about this. Let's just keep this between you and me.",
        "Rick: You don't want me to talk to olivia about this?",
        "Phillip: Oh, god, no. No.",
        "Rick: Okay.",
        "Phillip: Absolutely not her.",
        "Rick: Okay.",
        "Phillip: Just between us for right now, okay?",
        "Rick: You got it. You got it.",
        "Phillip: Okay.",
        "Rick: What I'll do is, I'm going to call langham, and I'll get back to you and tell you what he says, okay?",
        "Phillip: Okay. And you'll do it today.",
        "Rick: Yeah, I'll do it today. All right? Leah was so happy to see you, buddy.",
        "Phillip: I was happy to see her. I am happy for you.",
        "Rick: Yeah, thanks. All right. Now, you take care of yourself. Just get some rest.",
        "Phillip: But you're going to talk to him now, though, right?",
        "Rick: I'm going to talk to him right now.",
        "Phillip: Okay.",
        "Rick: Okay? All right.",
        "Tammy: Thanks for lisnining. You always know just what to say.",
        "Edmund: Tammy, you're a very special young lady. There's nothing I wouldn't do for you. You know that, right?",
        "Joey: You're going to be okay.",
        "Lizzie: And how do you know?",
        "Joey: Did olivia decide to press charges against you?",
        "Lizzie: No. Which means she doesn't think i did anything wrong, right?",
        "Joey: Not exactly. But at least it'S...",
        "Lizzie: I mean, I didn't really do anything wrong, because now everybody knows about emma. And my dad can spend time with her. Maybe that'll make him happier, and he won't be so depressed all the time. And maybe he can come home sooner to me and my mom, and all the people who love him. And we can protect him from olivia and keep her as far away from h a as possible.",
        "Olivia: I know. I know. You think maybe mommy's gone crazy, huh? It's just that I think alan is right. I think that keeping lizzie close by is better than constantly wondering whether she's hanging around, what she's doing. I don't know. You know what? Once the spauldings get to know you, they're just going to fall in love, and that's going to make my job so much easier. You know what my job is? My job is to love you and protect you, and help you get everything you need and deserve in life, now and in the future. So what do you say? Want to get packing? Yeah? Yeah?",
        "Marah: I should go.",
        "Jeffrey: All right. Well, you know, it might be kind of hard to get a flight at such late notice, and most of them leave in the evening. Is that okay?",
        "Marah: Sure.",
        "Jeffrey: All right, well, we'll sleep on the plane. When we wake up, we'll be in paris, all right? Why don't we have dinner tothther before?",
        "Marah: That sounds perfect.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay.",
        "Marah: All right, I'm going to go.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay.",
        "Marah: Bye.",
        "Jeffrey: Bye.",
        "Marah: You and me together in paris. Can you believe it? Okay. Okay. I'm going. I'm going.",
        "Jeffrey: Now you be going.",
        "Marah: I'm going.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay.",
        "Marah: Bye.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay. (Laughs)",
        "Marah: Bye.",
        "Jeffrey: Bye.",
        "Marah: Oh, my purse. (Laughs)",
        "Jeffrey: It's jeffrey. Marah just left me. Yeah, she's very excited. Yes, she's very happy that I'm taking care of the travel arrangements. She didn't suspect a thing.",
        "[NEXT_ON]",
        "Jeffrey: People I work for are pretty clear on this. If you refuse, danny...",
        "Danny: I'm not refusing.",
        "Shayne: What's going on with you? Are you okay?",
        "Marah: Everything is wonderful. I am going to paris with the man that I love."
