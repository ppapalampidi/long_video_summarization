    "Recap": [
        "After the slap and with Brooke on the floor, Quinn tells her to stay away from Deacon. Brooke gnashes that it was one thing to slap her but another whole thing about knocking her vodka out of her hand. Wyatt thinks he and Deacon should head over to Brooke's as he is sure that is where Quinn went. Steffy tells Ridge she is only considering this takeover if Liam is part of the bargain. Liam is kissing Ivy and she quips that she is not even wearing a bikini. He says she just has that power over him. She muses that she knew he was committed to her but hearing him tell Steffy that meant a lot to her. He says there are a lot of what if's with Steffy and this proposal is tempting but he has Ivy and he wouldn't have it any other way. She just wishes being with her is not going to keep him from getting the shares he wants to make this takeover happen. Ridge tells Steffy that Rick will have a whole year to run FC and he is not sure he can stomach that. Bill can not have anything to do with this and they all need to be protected. He does not want her to get her hopes but says he might be open to it. Ridge says she and her brother are too far away and he'd like her to come back. She says everything has to fall in place for that to happen. He wants to go and talk to Liam and see just where his head is.",
        "Wyatt tells Deacon that his mother hears what she wants to hear. Deacon tells him that nothing happened at Brooke's, but Wyatt is not so sure about that. His states that his mother has not cared about another man since Bill and she is taking a big risk by allowing him in her life so do not cross her. Brooke says she is not trying to take Deacon away from Quinn but obviously Quinn believes that. Quinn finally says she does not know what got into her and tries to help Brooke up but Brooke yells at her not to touch her. She orders her out of her house and to never come back again. Quinn goes home and asks Deacon if he would ever leave her for her. Deacon says Brooke, of course not. He loves Quinn and would not leave her for anyone. Brooke pours another drink of vodka and cries. Ivy overhears Steffy tell someone on the phone that she might move back to L.A. You never can tell but if she does being with Liam is part of the package. Ridge goes to see Liam and says he is there because of Steffy's offer. It will give Steffy back the life she wanted. Is Liam going to jump on this? Quinn tells Deacon that she knows he thinks she is over-reacting and that Brooke is innocent but she had to knock some sense into her. She can put on her bathing suit and take any man to bed she wants but not Deacon. Ivy tells Steffy that Liam will not be coming back to her. Steffy says she would not be so sure. Her dad is with Liam as they speak and if they come to an agreement then Liam will be back with her and Ivy's little two months bonding won't mean a thing compared to what they have. Ridge tells Liam that he does not want to wait a year but he can with no help from Liam. But if he has some feelings for Steffy without Ivy being in the picture then this could all work so Liam needs to seriously think about it."

        "Brooke: [Drunkenly] Okay. Oww! Ohh! Really? [Sighs] I mean, it's one thing to slap me, but to waste my vodka?",
        "Quinn: Stay away from Deacon!",
        "Brooke: Is he here?",
        "Quinn: I mean it. Stay the hell away from him!",
        "Wyatt: Shouldn't you be looking for mom?",
        "Deacon: Like you said, I called, texted.",
        "Wyatt: Well, it's no mystery where she went.",
        "Deacon: Yeah, Brooke's.",
        "Wyatt: We could head over there.",
        "Deacon: Wyatt, there's no reason. She was fast asleep. Look, even if Quinn was banging on the door, I guarantee Brooke ain't gonna hear it.",
        "Wyatt: Brooke was that wasted?",
        "Deacon: Yeah. I-I made a good decision taking her home.",
        "Wyatt: As long as you didn't make any bad decisions while you were over there.",
        "[Insects chirping]",
        "Steffy: Hey, dad.",
        "Ridge: Hey.",
        "Steffy: I didn't know you were still here.",
        "Ridge: Yeah. Just dropping off some sketches that napoleon can reject in the morning.",
        "Steffy: You know, it doesn't have to be this way.",
        "Ridge: [Sighs] I know. But it's -- [Sighs] I'm -- I'm having a tough time with this whole letting --",
        "Steffy: Liam just wants us to have the company back.",
        "Ridge: [Sighs]",
        "Steffy: Run it the way it used to be. And we can do that. We can use our shares to get rid of Rick.",
        "Ridge: And then the two of you can live happily ever after.",
        "Steffy: Liam knows I'm only considering this if he's part of the bargain.",
        "Ivy: Wow.",
        "Liam: What?",
        "Ivy: And I'm not even wearing a bikini.",
        "Liam: Bikini?",
        "Ivy: Earlier today? Steffy?",
        "Liam: Oh. Is that -- what -- really?",
        "Ivy: Really?",
        "Liam: What?",
        "Ivy: Did you seriously -- you didn't know what I was talking about?",
        "Liam: I guess you just have that power over me. Other women, they -- fwoo! -- Fade from my mind.",
        "Ivy: Oh, really?",
        "Liam: Yeah.",
        "Ivy: Even -- even bikini-clad ex-wives who have Forrester stock up for the taking?",
        "Liam: Yeah, yeah, yeah, especially them.",
        "Ivy: [Chuckles] Hey, I... I-I knew that you were committed to us. But hearing it today first-hand, you defending our relationship, it just -- it -- it meant a lot to me. Must have been pretty tempting, being offered another shot with Steffy.",
        "Liam: Tempting? Uh... maybe, but not -- not in the way that you're thinking. There's a lot of \"what ifs\" when it comes to Steffy and my relationship. I mean, what if the baby had lived? What if our marriage had lasted? So, yeah, I suppose it can be tempting to get lost in what could have been, and... if I didn't have you, maybe I would have, but... I do have you. And I wouldn't have it any other way.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, I just... I just wish being with me didn't mean you weren't gonna get those Forrester shares. I mean, how are you gonna make any of this work out if you don't have Ridge and Steffy?",
        "Liam: I don't know. Maybe Steffy will change her mind.",
        "Ivy: I hope so. You need their shares to make this happen.",
        "Ridge: Oh, boy. Your grandfather's given full support to Rick, which means he has a whole year to do whatever he wants with this company. How am I gonna stomach that? And then Liam's proposal -- I don't -- I'm not comfortable with that, either.",
        "Steffy: Dad, come on. Something needs to be done.",
        "Ridge: Something needs to be done. I know. And I'm trying to figure it out. There's a couple of things we need to be sure of. Number one -- bill has nothing to do with this. And number two -- we're all protected, right? So I got to talk to Carter and just make sure that the whole legal aspect of it is covered. [Sighs] Oh, Steffy. I don't want you to get your hopes up, but...I'm open to it. Maybe we can make it work.",
        "Deacon: I told you what happened. I drove her home.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, and then suddenly she's putting on a swimsuit?",
        "Deacon: She wanted to take a dip! I mean, it's not the way you're making it sound.",
        "Wyatt: Okay, but situations like these -- my mother hears what she wants to hear.",
        "Deacon: What? That I'm a decent guy who gave a friend who had a few too many drinks a ride home?",
        "Wyatt: That a woman you used to sleep with was drunk and was trying to get you into her swimming pool.",
        "Deacon: Wyatt. Nothing happened. Brooke, come here.",
        "Wyatt: You sure about that?",
        "Brooke: I'm no threat to you!",
        "Quinn: Exactly. So get that in your head!",
        "Brooke: I'm not gonna stay away from Deacon! We have a daughter!",
        "Quinn: You have an adult daughter who lives in a different country who doesn't need her parents communicating!",
        "Brooke: I'm just --",
        "Quinn: What?! What?! And now that no other man will have you, you're gonna go after the one that you've been shunning all these years?! What do you think? You can take Deacon away from me?!",
        "Brooke: No. But obviously you do.",
        "Quinn: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I-I don't -- I don't know what got into me. I -- here.",
        "Brooke: Don't.",
        "Quinn: No, no, I'm --",
        "Brooke: Don't!",
        "Quinn: I just want --",
        "Brooke: Don't!",
        "Quinn: You're drunk! Just let me --",
        "Brooke: Don't touch me!",
        "Deacon: Look, Wyatt, you're a good son, but relax. Nothing happened.",
        "Wyatt: Okay. I don't mean to pry. But I know your history with Brooke. And I know what could happen, especially if she was knocking a few back. But I just want you to know one thing. My mother hasn't cared about another man like this since my father. And she's taken a big risk opening up her heart to you and trusting you. Do not hurt her.",
        "Quinn: I shouldn't have slapped you.",
        "Brooke: You think?",
        "Quinn: And I apologize for spilling your drink. I'll help you clean it up.",
        "Brooke: Just leave.",
        "Quinn: I'm just -- I'm just trying to make things right.",
        "Brooke: You can't.",
        "Quinn: Can't you at least understand where I'm coming from?",
        "Brooke: No, you're psycho! You -- you slapped me so hard that I fall on the ground! [Sighs]",
        "Quinn: In my defense, you are a little unsteady on your feet.",
        "Brooke: I'm not drunk, if that's what you're implying.",
        "Quinn: Well, you don't usually slur your words, but okay.",
        "Brooke: What's it matter to you?",
        "Quinn: It doesn't. Get drunk. Pass out. I-I don't really care. Just do it away from Deacon. I have only been interested in two men my entire life -- bill and Deacon. You had bill. I don't even want bill anymore! But Deacon -- Deacon is different. He wants to be with me! And I'm not gonna let you take him away!",
        "Brooke: I don't desire Deacon. But he is a good listener and he's a good friend, and if I want to hang out with Deacon, I'm gonna hang out with Deacon! Now go! I never want you here again!",
        "Quinn: Fine. Enjoy your hangover tomorrow.",

        "[Door locks]",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] [Sighs]",
        "Ivy: Okay. Well, I better get back to work. I have to be top of my game if I have to face 12 months of Rick as boss.",
        "Liam: [Scoffs] Hey, question. Uh, you're not blaming yourself, are you? 'Cause I really don't want you to feel responsible. This takeover may not work, but that's not your fault.",
        "Ivy: I just wish Steffy could rise above her feelings for you and do what's best for this company, do what's best for everyone. I mean, is it too late to think that she might still do that? Bye.",
        "Liam: Bye.",
        "Steffy: I won't get my hopes up, but I'm thrilled you're considering it.",
        "Ridge: Well, I am. It just seems wrong to sit here if we could put Rick in his place.",
        "Steffy: We can do that. Running Forrester with you and Liam... I want him back, and this will make that happen.",
        "Ridge: Good. I want you back. You -- you and your brother, you're just too far away. So that's what I want. And what I don't want is you thinking I'm gonna make a business decision just to fix your love life.",
        "Steffy: I understand, but I'm not asking you to do that.",
        "Ridge: You kind of are asking me.",
        "Steffy: No, I'm asking you to fix the company. Everything else will fall into place.",
        "Ridge: Hmm. Wonder where you got that self-confidence.",
        "Steffy: I don't know. Hmm. [Laughs]",
        "Ridge: All right. I'm gonna go talk to Liam.",
        "Steffy: You are?",
        "Ridge: Yeah.",
        "Steffy: Like, tonight?",
        "Ridge: Tonight. Right now. If we're gonna do this, I need to see where his head is.",
        "Steffy: Okay.",
        "Ridge: Okay.",
        "Steffy: Thank you. [Chuckles]",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Steffy: [Sighs]",
        "Brooke: I'm fine. I'm not drunk. I'm a little buzzed.",
        "Deacon: I know, I know. I-I didn't mean to do that. I --",
        "Brooke: Oh, shut up. Of course you --",
        "[Door opens]",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Deacon: Hey. Where you been?",
        "Quinn: Had some errands to run.",
        "Deacon: I-I threw the food in the oven. It should be ready in a minute. You want some?",
        "Quinn: Sure.",
        "Deacon: Okay.",
        "Quinn: You wouldn't leave me for her, would you?",
        "Deacon: Who? Brooke? Honey, I wouldn't leave you for anybody. Hey. I love you, and I respect you. Okay? That's why-- That's why I-I told you I didn't want to hide anything from you. Okay? You know, you just took off with these errands a little suddenly. I mean, I thought we were gonna have dinner together. You wouldn't answer my calls. You wouldn't answer my texts. Did you go over to Brooke's? Quinn, what happened?",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] [Sighs}",
        "Steffy: [Laughs] I know. I promise I'll start coming to L.A. More often. Who knows? Maybe I'll move back permanently. All right. I'll see you soon. Ciao.",
        "[Cell phone beeps]",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Steffy: Ivy. Hey.",
        "Ivy: Hey. Sorry, I, um, I didn't mean to eavesdrop.",
        "Steffy: No, it's fine. What's up?",
        "Ivy: You're moving back to LA?",
        "Steffy: Who knows? Anything's possible.",
        "Ivy: Well, I-I think you should. The company needs you.",
        "Steffy: Well, a lot would have to change in order for me to make that move.",
        "Ivy: Steffy, I think you're making this a lot more complicated than what it needs to be.",
        "Steffy: If Liam wants my stocks, if we're taking over Forrester, being with me is part of the package.",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Liam: Ah, couldn't stay away, huh?",
        "Ridge: And there it is, that irresistible charm that everyone talks about.",
        "Liam: Uh, hi, Ridge.",
        "Ridge: Hi. Nice. Hey, I'm curious. Who do you think it was? Steffy or Ivy? And be careful how you answer that. It might affect why I'm here.",
        "Liam: This is about my offer?",
        "Ridge: Steffy's offer, yeah. You know what? I thought about it, and this could work out well for everybody. Control the company, Rick is gone, and Steffy would have the life she wants back. She was never happier than when she was with you. Let me ask you something. Why aren't you jumping on it?",
        "Deacon: So, you went to Brooke's?",
        "Quinn: Yeah.",
        "Deacon: So, was she awake?",
        "Quinn: She was awake. She definitely wasn't sobering up.",
        "Deacon: So she was still drinking?",
        "Quinn: I think I got her to stop. I, um...knocked some sense into her.",
        "Deacon: Thanks. I think.",
        "Quinn: I had to go. I-I had to tell her. I know you think I'm overreacting about this and that -- and that her motives are innocent, but, I mean, come on. Brooke Logan doesn't get drunk and don a bathing suit and invite some guy to a swim party for no reason.",
        "Deacon: Quinn, she's lonely.",
        "Quinn: What does she know about loneliness? She's surrounded by her sisters and her children and any number of men who will drive her home when she's tipsy. Brooke's lonely. Well, she can find anyone else to tuck her in to bed at night. Any other man. Any man but you.",
        "Deacon: Come here. [Sighs]",
        "Brooke: [Sobbing]",
        "Ivy: He's not going back to you, Steffy.",
        "Steffy: Uh, maybe.",
        "Ivy: I told him that I saw you kissing him.",
        "Steffy: That is awkward.",
        "Ivy: No, actually. It was, uh, it kind of connected us. It's just so much honesty. It was kind of like a bonding experience.",
        "Steffy: Oh, boy. You seem like you're confident on the outside. But I know you're nervous. You know what Liam and I had. Dating you a couple months doesn't compare. And that scares you. You know my dad went to see Liam? I think he's on board, or will be very soon. So, if he and Liam come to an agreement tonight, if they decide to be partners, your little bonding experience won't add up to much. Because Liam will be starting a life with me.",
        "Liam: What are you saying right now? Are you ready to make a deal?",
        "Ridge: I'm saying there's a possibility. But I'm also saying that the day-to- day running of the company has to be up to Steffy and me.",
        "Liam: Fine. As long as it's not Rick. As long as Ivy and Caroline are not miserable at the end of every work day, fine. Look, I'm not gonna lie. I want to be involved. I do. But I've got enough going on at Spencer, and frankly, I trust you and Steffy to elevate Forrester to the level I know it can attain. Ridge, I'm pumped about this. I really am. I see the light at the end of the tunnel. I know I can make this happen.",
        "Ridge: Not without Steffy. She's got 25%, and she's only gonna be on board if you guys are back together.",
        "Liam: Are you playing matchmaker right now?",
        "Ridge: What you do in your personal life has nothing to do with me. But if you want my support, there has to be something that benefits Steffy. I'm doing what any father would do. I want her to be comfortable and I want her to be happy. If you can provide that, that's great. If you can't, that's great, too. I'll put my head down and get through this year with Rick. Caroline's gonna suffer a little bit, Ivy's gonna suffer a little bit, but hey, it's only a year. And after that year, my dad's gonna step in. And he's gonna see that Rick can't run anything. He's gonna ship him off to, I don't know, the basement, paris, Elba. I don't want to wait a year. I want something to happen now. It's not up to me. It's up to you. If you still have feelings for Steffy, make the right move. We can have the company, you can have your family back. But Ivy can't be in the picture. You think about it.",
