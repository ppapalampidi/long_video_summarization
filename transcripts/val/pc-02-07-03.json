        "Ian tells Lucy that he might be able to fix the problem with their blood cells, but it could take some time. Kevin phones Lucy, so she goes to his jail cell and says she took out a restraining order. Kevin tells her that he no longer loves her but he's not through with her; he intends to pay her back for what she's done to him. She gives him back her ring before leaving in tears. As Jamal & Alison watch on the monitor, Tess yells at Stephen not to bite Jack. She is horrified and runs out, so Jack follows her. He tells her that there is no good to save in Stephen. She agrees to go away with him. Rafe suggests to Caleb that he has nothing left in Port Charles so he should just leave town. Stephen/Caleb remembers Tess saying he has great love and how she looked at him when he was holding Jack. He swears that they will all pay. Then he spots the hidden camera and tells Rafe through it that he's not leaving Port Charles because he has some \"unfinished business\". He takes out some dusty, mystical-looking book from a hidden place in the wall and opens it, saying \"Forget the war, Rafe...this is gonna be a massacre\". The lights flicker and go out all over town. When they come back on, Tess is gone from Jack's side. He tells Rafe and the rest what happened. Rafe tells them that Caleb's revenge is beginning. Caleb prays to the devil and calls out all the vampires. He is transported to the park (or some clearing) where the two band members appear. Ian is in the bushes. They all chant \"Against the righteous, condemn the blood.\""

        "Lucy: Possibly? That would be incredible.",
        "Ian: It would, but we're still a long way away from that.",
        "Lucy: No, I know that, but just even the possibility is pretty amazing, almost like a dream come true.",

        "Lucy: Yeah.",

        "Lucy: Oh. I guess I have to get that in case it's the girls.",

        "Lucy: Yeah, I'm very surprised, actually.",
        "Kevin: Well, you shouldn't be. We still have a lot to talk about.",
        "Lucy: No, kevin, actually, we don't have a lot --",

        "Alison: Jack's in trouble. Caleb's got him by the throat.",
        "Jamal: I know, I know, and his fangs are looking pretty nasty. Come on, jack! Come on, come on, come on! Where's rafe and tess?",
        "Alison: If they don't walk through the door in, like, five seconds --",
        "jamal: Ok, they're there, they're there.",
        "Alison: Get away from him. Get away from him!",

        "Tess: Let him go.",
        "Jack: What took you guys so long?",
        "Rafe: Just look at him, tess. Look at him. See, that's the real stephen clay, the vampire caleb morley.",
        "Tess: Stephen.",
        "Caleb: Don't listen to them, tess.",
        "Tess: But I saw you.",
        "Caleb: No.",

        "Rafe: Too bad. Looks like even your biggest fans are bailing on you.",
        "Lucy: I -- I got to go.",
        "Ian: Why? So he can threaten you again? I'm going to go talk to this boy.",
        "Lucy: Wait a minute, no, you're not.",
        "Ian: Why not?",
        "Lucy: No, you're not. You can'T.",
        "Ian: No, I'm not going to have him threaten you anymore.",
        "Lucy: I know, but if you go and you get angry, you know what might happen. You can't --",
        "ian: I know. You don't have to remind me. I know.",
        "Lucy: All right. Listen, it'll be ok. I mean, kevin is in jail, so I'll be safe.",
        "Ian: Then why go?",
        "Lucy: I have to go. I got to go for me. I got to stop this. I'm sick of it. I'm sick of hiobobsessive behavior. It's dangerous and it's crazy, and I'm going to tell him no surprise phone calls, and he certainly can't stop by for a visit. It just -- it has to be over, it has to be done.",
        "Ian: You sure?",
        "Lucy: Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure. This is the only thing I can think of to do because I'm not sure what he's capable of next.",
        "Ian: Shouldn't have to go through any of this. I'm --",
        "lucy: I know. I know.",
        "[Ian sighs]",
        "Ian: Got a whack-job husband in jail, got me here. You deserve better.",
        "Lucy: I have better. I have you. I want to be here. Kevin is not kevin anymore. He's not the man that I loved at all. In fact, I don't think he exists for anyone anymore, I mean, his friends, his dad. Victor -- he doesn't have anything to do with him anymore.",
        "Ian: Yeah, I know.",
        "Lucy: No, no, you don't know. Don't do that. Don'T. Please? You're not like that. You didn't ask for any of this to happen and you want to change, you want to be back to yourself.",
        "Ian: What I want and what I have are two different things. What if this doesn't work out? What if this research doesn't lead anywhere and I'm going to be a vamp--",
        "lucy: Don't say that. Don'T.",
        "Ian: Well, we both know it's true.",
        "Lucy: Ok, fine. Then so be it. If it takes a year or 10 years 20 years, then we will fight this and we will win.",
        "Ian: \"We\"? Like the sound of that.",
        "Lucy: Well, then get used to it.",
        "Ian: Hmm.",
        "Jack: Tess, come on, wait. Tess, wait.",
        "Tess: Leave me alone, jack.",
        "Jack: No, no, no, we have to talk about this. Look, you know that I love you, right?",
        "Tess: I know, but --",
        "jack: Ok, then you have to trust me like you always do, ok? I didn't want you to see that. But you had to see that stephen clay is not the guy you think he is.",
        "Tess: I know what you diwas out of love, but what I saw, what stephen is -- it was just horrible.",
        "Jack: Ye he's evil.",
        "Tess: He almost killed you, jack, my husband.",
        "Jack: Yes, but I'm all right.",
        "Tess: How could one human being do that to another?",
        "Jack: That's the thing, tess, caleb is not human. All right? He's a dead soul, and that's what you saw. There's nothing inside of him that's worth saving.",
        "Tess: He told me that he never wanted to be a vampire, that he wanted to change.",
        "Jack: Yeah, well, the only thing he wants to change is us.",
        "Tess: He likes it, jack. I could see it in his eyes.",
        "Jack: Ani'sosorry that you had to see that. But you believed in caleb and he used that.",
        "Tess: Know. I'm sorry I believed in him. I really thought he wanted my help. I thought he -- I thought he wanted to change, but it was all lies.",
        "Rafe: Not really on your game, are you, caleb?",
        "Caleb: This doesn't change anything.",
        "Rafe: Yeah, you're right. It changes everything. See, now that tess has seen that you'll never change, that you're just as dark and twisted as you ever were, I don't thin she's going to be too interested in being your buddy.",
        "Caleb: What tess saw was a all part of me. She'll get over it.",
        "Rafe: I doubt that. See, she just watched you almost break her husband's neck. She's not livvie, caleb -- or did you forget that? I mean, she's not going to be turned on by your interesting, quaint, little behaviors. Did you see her face when she ran out of here? She was disgusted, man, by you.",
        "Caleb: What do you say we cut the crap and put our cards on the table?",
        "Rafe: Ok. All right. Yeah, I'm fine with that. See, now, the way I see it, there's nothing left for you in this town.",
        "Caleb: What makes you think so?",
        "Rafe: Well, come on, you had your fun. You got to play rock star, you messed around with me and alison, you turned alison's mother into a vampire, and then you kicked her to the curb like she was garbage. But you know what? You are never going to get what you really came here for. You lost livvie. Now you lost tess.",
        "Caleb: And your point is?",
        "Rafe: My point? Well, my point is we had a deal once -- you stick to your business, I stick to mine. Well, I got another for you, and if you're half as smart as you think you are, you'll take it",
        "caleb: Go on.",
        "Rafe: I want you to leave port charles forever. And in return, I will not make your miserable life any worse than it is. Ok? That's the deal.",
        "Caleb: All deals are off.",
        "[Door slams]",
        "Officer: Heads up, collins. You've got a visitor.",
        "Kevin: Oh, my gosh. I wonder who it could be.",
        "Officer: I'll be outside if you need me, ma'am. Five minutes, you two.",
        "Lucy: This won't take that long, thank you.",
        "Kevin: You came, lucy. I'm touched. Didid you bring me anything? Candy? Girlie mag?",
        "Lucy: Don't talk, please. Just listen.",
        "Kevin: Is that any way to talk to your dear, devoted husband?",
        "Lucy: Only came because I wanted to let you ow I have decided to press charges against you for your little kidnapping stunt.",
        "Kevin: I'm not surprised.",
        "Lucy: And I also had a restraining order issued against you to keep you away from me.",
        "Kevin: That's very thorough.",
        "Lucy: I never dreamed in all of eternity I'd be saying this to you, but, doc, I do not want you in my life anymore. I want you to stay away from me until you get help -- serious help. No more phone calls, no more little surprise visits, nothing.",
        "Kevin: You through?",
        "Lucy: No. You are to stay away from me and the girls. I want you to stay away from the children.",
        "Kevin: Anything else?",
        "Lucy: No.",
        "Kevin: Good. Because I didn't ask you down here to try and win you back, lucy. I wanted to tell you that I don't want you back.",
        "Lucy: Really?",
        "Kevin: Really. After that last betrayal, lucy, I'm finally over you.",
        "Lucy: You're over me?",
        "Kevin: Yes, I know, impossible. But I have this funny thing about loyalty, lucy, and when the going gets tough, you sure get going.",
        "Lucy: Which is exactly what I'm going to do now.",
        "Kevin: But before you go, I guess I should clarify one thing.",
        "Lucy: Fine. What?",
        "Kevin: When I said I was over you, all I mean is that I have no loving feelings for you at all. And I'm not finished with you, lucy -- not by a lonshshot.",
        "Jack: Look, let's try to forget about caleb.",
        "Tess: I don't think I can.",
        "Jack: I just came up with the best idea all day. Come with me, ok?",
        "Tess: But, jack --",
        "jack: No.",
        "Tess: Where -- where are we going?",
        "Jack: We are going to get out of here, out of port charles, away from all the vampires or anything that reminds us of it.",
        "Tess: No, but, jack --",
        "jack: No, listen, I love you and I want us to have the life that we both deserve, but we can't have that here in port charles, not if caleb's flying around. Ok, we have to be one step ahead of him.",
        "Tess: How?",
        "Jack: You have to let it go. This is one soul, tess, that you can't save. Can you do that? Will you come with me?",
        "Tess: Yes, jack.",
        "Jack: Ok.",
        "Tess: Take me away, please.",
        "Jack: Ok.",
        "Tess: Take me away.",
        "Rafe: Alison.",
        "Alison: Oh, rafe.",
        "Jamal: Hey. Nice work. Pretty impressive.",
        "Alison: I'soso, so proud of you.",
        "Rafe: Yeah, well, you know, I just did what I had to do. How's tess?",
        "Jamal: She's with jack. Kind of shaken up.",
        "Rafe: Not an easy thing to see.",
        "Alison: Yeah, well, at least now she knows who he really is.",
        "Jamal: And he's not a happy camper.",
        "Rafe: What do you mean?",
        "Jamal: Well, ever since you left, we've been checking out the monitor and he's been just losing his mind.",
        "Rafe: Yeah, well, I thought he would be.",
        "Jamal: Yeah, well, I just hope he takes your advice and leaves town, asap.",
        "Rafe: I don't think he will be. I don't think caleb's going anywhere.",
        "Alison: What do you mean? I thought you told him.",
        "Rafe: No, I made him an offer. Look, we got the best of caleb today, but just enough to piss him off. He's going to have a response.",
        "Jamal: Great, great.",
        "Alison: Well, wh kind of a response?",
        "Rafe: I don't know. Whatever it is, it's not going to be pretty.",
        "[Tumblers shatter]",
        "Tess' voice: You have a heart capable of great love. I can hear it beating. Please, stephen, just list to it. Stephen.",
        "Caleb: You'll pay for tT. All of you.",
        "Rafe: Oh, my god, no.",
        "Alison: Rafe, what is happening?",
        "Jamal: He got it. He saw the camera. He saw the camera.",
        "Rafe: Oh, yeah. He sees it, all right.",
        "Alison: Oh, my god.",
        "Caleb: So you've been watching me, little man. Is there no end to your dirty tricks? Well, here's a little public service announcement before I end the show -- I'm declining your offer to leave port charles. It seems I have some unfinished business. That's all, folks.",
        "Caleb: Forget the war, rafe. This is going to be a massacre.",
        "lucy: More threats, huh? They're getting to be pretty commonplace from you these days.",
        "Kevin: Sarcasm's unattractive, lucy.",
        "Lucy: You can't do it, doc, not anymore. You can't hurt me -- at least not any more than you've already devastated me.",
        "Kevin: Don't be so sure.",
        "Lucy: You're in jail. You need to be in jail. This is where you belong now.",
        "Kevin: Yeah, I'm in jail.",
        "Lucy: For a very good reason, you know.",
        "Kevin: But I won't always be. Someday, I'm going to get out. And I'm going to remember the wife who locked me in hospitals, in jails, and who abandoned our marriage just so she could play footsie with a neanderthal like ian thornhart. And you won't know when and you won't ow how, but I will pay you back -- with interest.",
        "Lucy: Officer?",
        "Lucy: I need to get out of here. What -- what is that?",
        "Officer: Beats me. It's never done that before.",
        "Lucy: I got to go.",
        "Kevin: Lights out. How appropriate.",
        "Jack: Tess, are you sure? You're ready to leave?",
        "Tess: I'm sure.",

        "[Dog barks]",
        "Jack: Whoa. It looks like the lights went out in the whole town. Tess, are you -- tess? Tess! Tess, where are you?",
        "Alison: Guys, what happened? Atat's the matter? What just happened to the lights?",
        "Rafe: I don't know, but the monitor's still not working.",
        "Jamal: Well, the panel box is cool. There's no reason why the lights should've went off like that.",
        "Rafe: Ok, I got a very bad feeling about this.",
        "Jack: You guys, come out here quick. It's tess.",
