        "Quinn encourages Wyatt to take a stand and do something about Liam having kidnapped Hope. Wyatt says Liam is desperate to which Quinn replies yes and desperate people can be dangerous. Wyatt says Hope knows what she wants and it isn't Liam. He says let's go. Quinn grouses on the way and says Liam needs to be put in his place. Wyatt tells her it won't be by her; that he will handle Liam. She just needs to drop him off and stay out of it. She tells him do not engage in a conversation with Liam. He is not like them. Meanwhile Liam is trying to convince Hope that they are at a crossroads but have a second chance to get it right. And if they don't take it he is freaking out that they won't get another. He suddenly kisses her until she breaks away and says he is crazy; he just stole Wyatt's truck and trailer. Liam says he knows he is acting like an insane person but she was almost pregnant and that would have been the end of them and he could not let that happen. She doesn't know what this is supposed to accomplish. He says he needed to talk to her alone. Kind of talk some sense into her. She reminds him that she is dating Wyatt. She is in a relationship with him. Liam agrees but says if she is not ready to marry Wyatt then she sure as heck doesn't want to have his baby. While he is out of the room, she picks up his jacket and thinks back on Italy. Liam walks in and says this is her home; come back to him. He reveals this pregnancy thing scared him to the core and he knows it had to scare her too. She admits it did. He says he would have lost her forever. She says she is not so that did not happen. He asks her to look around and see the memories; they belong here. She admits it is special and he's special and honestly she is not ready to give up on all of this. But she reminds him again that she is dating Wyatt. She likes that they are taking things slowly. He's patient and doesn't pressure her. Liam says okay but she was almost pregnant and if there is anything that puts pressure on it would be that. It would have meant marriage, children, the mother-in-law who lies. They would be married right now except for that woman. Hope says she doesn't want to talk about her. He says okay, then just focus on him and all the fun they used to have. Remember that fun computer Geek, Liam Cooper. Donna drops in on Brooke and asks if the rumors she has heard are true .Brooke is back with Bill. Brooke says Ridge made his choice so now so has she. Ridge is with Katie and she has become very power hungry. They discuss Karen having 50%, Bill 49% and Katie 1%, so she and Karen have controlling interest as long as they are a team. That isn't likely to change as she is on the outs with her brother. Katie has a meeting with Justin and Karen who is in town. Whether they want to call it a situation or the problem, Karen realizes they have flattened out and this is unacceptable and they need to do something about it. Katie says they will get the earnings back up; they can hold her to that. Katie tells Karen that she is sure Justin is sharing all of her shortcomings with Bill. He's lucky he still has a job. Karen says she doesn't know what she is going to do about her brother either. He was so supportive when she came out and she hoped they could have a good brother/sister relationship, but now he is stubborn as a mule. She mentions that Katie looks much happier than the last time she was there. Katie says it is because she is in love. Karen says if she is happy then she is happy. Katie has a scheduled meeting so Karen has to go. She gets a phone call from Brooke wanting her to meet her for lunch and don't tell anyone.",
        "Hope tells Liam that this wasn't a very good idea. He did not have to hi-jack a truck to see her. Liam says he will remember that next time. He says here's the thing. This has taught him how easy it is to lose each other and he could not live with that. He loves her too damn much and this is his one shot to put all the little pieces back together. He grabs her by the face with both hands and is about to kiss her when Wyatt comes barging in and tells him to get his hands off of Hope. He tells Hope let's go and asks Liam for the keys to his truck. Liam throws him the keys and says the truck needs an overhaul. Wyatt says Liam is pathetic; kidnapping Hope just to get time with her alone the only way he knew she'd come. Liam says maybe he ought to ask Hope if she wants to go or stay. He says she doesn't have to go. This is her home and always will be. Hope looks at him and tells Liam that she is sorry. She picks up her purse and leaves with Wyatt opening the door for her. Karen joins Brooke for lunch. Brooke tells her she wants to talk to her about her brother and Brooke's sister. Karen says she was just with Katie so what is the problem. She repeats to her what she told Donna .that Katie is on a power trip. Karen says all she sees is they are butting heads over the men in their lives and they both ought to be deliriously happy. Brooke asks Karen if she is happy with Katie's running SP. Karen admits there have been a few hiccups. Brooke says she loves her sister and she is going to continue to work on that relationship, but she doesn't think she should be running SP. And if Karen doesn't want to, then give it to Bill. Hire him back as CEO and let him do what he does best and fire Katie. Quinn comes charging through the back patio doors, and double pushes Liam in the chest and tells him to never pull something like this again. He points his finger at her and says Wyatt will never end up with Hope. Does she understand that, never! She raises her arm again but he blocks it. If looks could kill."

        "Donna: Our little Katie.",
        "Brooke: Yes. I really hate saying that about her, but it's true. She's living with Ridge, she's running the company, and she's on a major power trip.",

        "Katie: So, was Dani able to make it this time?",
        "Karen: She's too busy.",
        "Justin: Oh, please give her our best.",
        "Karen: I'll do that. So, let's talk business.",
        "Katie: Yes, let's. Janette.",
        "Janette: P&l;, for the first quarter, is summarized on page 1. The comParison for the first quarter of last year is on the next page.",
        "Justin: Yes, I've already looked these over.",
        "Katie: As have I.",
        "Justin: Then you know the situation.",
        "Katie: The situation?",
        "Justin: Right. More like the problem.",
        "Karen: Situation? Problem? It's not good. We flattened out. What are we gonna do about it?",
        "Katie: We are in transition.",
        "Justin: From profit to loss.",
        "Katie: Do I have to remind you, Justin, that we just came out of a recession? We have to adjust our expectations.",
        "Justin: What do you think of these numbers?",
        "Karen: I think they're unacceptable. And I think Katie knows that. Now, the question is, how do we turn it around?",
        "Katie: Janette?",
        "Janette: Katie's future projections.",
        "Wyatt: He's desperate, mom.",
        "Quinn: Yes, and desperate people are dangerous.",
        "Wyatt: Hope knows what she wants, and it isn't Liam.",
        "Quinn: Okay, I admire your confidence, Wyatt, but just to sit around and do nothing?",
        "Wyatt: Who says I'm doing nothing, huh? He stole my rig, he stole my girlfriend, and I want them back. Let's go.",
        "Hope: Mm! What?! Liam! Are you crazy?!",
        "Liam: I-I --",
        "Hope: You just stole Wyatt's truck and his trailer!",
        "Liam: I know! I know! Okay, I get it. I'm acting like an insane person, but come on -- you were almost pregnant, and that would've been it for us. What am I supposed to do? You tell me. I just let that happen?",
        "Hope: What is this supposed to accomplish?",
        "Liam: Uh, get you alone?",
        "Hope: What? Wh-- why? So you can talk some sense into me?",
        "Liam: Well... yeah, kind of.",
        "Hope: [Groans] Enough, Liam. Enough. There has to be a line here. I'm -- I'm dating Wyatt. I'm in a relationship with Wyatt.",
        "Liam: I know. I know you are, but... you're not ready to marry him. And if you're not ready to marry him, you're sure as hell not ready to have his kids.",
        "Hope: [Sighs]",
        "Katie: As you can see, our new distribution strategy will show results in two quarters. Add that to our planned acquisitions, our increased internet presence, and the new P.R. Campaign that I'm suggesting, and we'll be fine. We'll be more than fine.",
        "Justin: So we're looking at lower earnings for the next two quarters until this kicks in. That's if it kicks in.",
        "Katie: It will.",
        "Justin: I'm just saying, Katie, we never had to lower our expectations. That's not the norm around here.",
        "Katie: You mean when Bill was running the company?",
        "Justin: Say what you want, he did a great job running the company.",
        "Katie: He was also very lucky. And I believe he was short-sighted. His views were narrow. Morale around here was low. Listen, I understand that we need to increase growth, and we will with this plan. It just may take some time.",
        "Karen: But not a lot.",
        "Katie: No, a couple of quarters, at most.",
        "Karen: Because, Katie, we have to get back on track, earning-wise.",
        "Katie: I understand that, and we will. You can hold me to that.",
        "Karen: Then let's keep moving forward.",
        "Justin: And if earnings are any indication, we are definitely moving backwards.",
        "Karen: Thank you, Justin, for your input. And you, as well.",
        "Donna: I wonder how Katie's meeting went.",
        "Brooke: She has Karen's support.",
        "Donna: Karen owns the majority, right?",
        "Brooke: She owns 50%, Bill owns 49%, and Katie makes up the difference.",
        "Donna: So, she and Karen have controlling interest.",
        "Brooke: As long as they're a team.",
        "Donna: Well, I don't see that changing. Do you?",
        "Brooke: Karen has issues with her brother.",
        "Donna: Huh. Have they ever gotten along?",
        "Brooke: Mm, it's kind of like Katie and me right now. There's just a lot of frustration.",
        "Donna: But sisters work things out.",
        "Brooke: And so do sisters and brothers. I've got to go.",
        "[Door opens, closes]",
        "Quinn: When I get my hands on that Liam...",
        "Wyatt: It's not gonna happen.",
        "Quinn: He needs to be put in his place.",
        "Wyatt: Not by you. I'll handle him.",
        "Quinn: Wyatt --",
        "Wyatt: You're to stay in the car. I'll take care of Liam.",
        "Liam: This is your home. I me, it's our home. Come back to me.",
        "Hope: [Sighs]",
        "Liam: Hope, this, uh... this pregnancy thing... it scared me, you know? It -- it, uh... it scared me to my core. And I -- you know, I don't expect you to say so, but I know it scared you, too.",
        "Hope: Are you kidding? Of course it scared me.",
        "Liam: If you had been pregnant, we would've lost each other forever.",
        "Hope: But I'm not.",
        "Liam: No, you're not. And here you are. Hope, this place -- look at this place. I mean... we belong here. All the memories, all the good times...",
        "Hope: You're right. It is special. You're special. And, honestly, no, I'M... I'm not ready to give up on all this. But I'm dating Wyatt now. We're taking things really slowly, and I like that. I like that he's patient. I like that he doesn't pressure me.",
        "Liam: Okay. But you were almost pregnant, and if there's anything that puts pressure on someone, it's that. 'Cause think about what that would've meant. Would've meant marriage, children... a mother-in-law who lies and manipulates, a grandmother to your child.",
        "Hope: [Sighs]",
        "Liam: We'd be married right now if it weren't for that woman.",
        "Hope: I-I really -- I don't even want to talk about her, okay?",
        "Liam: Okay, we don't have to. We don't have to. [Chuckles] Let's focus on the good, then. Focus on me. All the fun we used to have...",
        "Hope: [Chuckles]",
        "Liam: ...Enjoying each other, making each other laugh. 'Cause I haven't gone anywhere. It's still me. I'm the same guy. You know me -- Liam cooper. Remember? That computer geek you reunited with his father all those years ago... and I may have gotten lost along the way, but, hope... in here, I have always belonged to you. Don't close the book on us when we have so much more story to tell.",
        "Wyatt: Look, when we get there, just drop me off. Hope and I will take the truck home.",
        "Quinn: Don't get into a conversation with Liam.",
        "Wyatt: No more input, please! I can handle this.",
        "Quinn: All I'm saying is, don't underestimate that brother of yours. He isn't like us.",
        "Wyatt: No, he certainly isn't.",
        "Katie: Thank you so much for all of your support. I can't tell you how much I appreciate it.",
        "Karen: It's not a problem. But Justin's not one of your cheerleaders.",
        "Katie: No, he's not. He's actually lucky to have a job.",
        "Karen: He and Bill are close.",
        "Katie: I know. I'm sure he's telling Bill all about my shortcomings.",
        "Karen: I don't know what I'm gonna do about my brother.",
        "Katie: You and me both.",
        "Karen: Brooke?",
        "Katie: Do you know...?",
        "Karen: That she's living with Bill?",
        "Katie: Yeah. Who told you?",
        "Karen: I keep tabs on my brother. And on you.",
        "Katie: Hmm.",
        "Karen: You're with Ridge?",
        "Katie: Um, yeah, I guess that's one good thing that's come out of all this.",
        "Karen: You certainly seem happier than you were the last time I was here.",
        "Katie: I'm in love.",
        "Karen: Well, if you're happy, I'm happy.",
        "Katie: Thank you. I would really like to resolve things with Brooke. I mean, I don't like where we're at.",
        "Karen: You know, I feel the same about Bill. I feel badly. He was so supportive when I came out to him. I really thought it was the beginning of a closer brother-sister relationship that we never had and wanted. I mean, at least I did.",
        "Katie: Well, some time has passed. Maybe the two of you can work on a healthier relationship.",
        "Karen: I'd like that, but you know Bill. I mean, he's stubborn as a mule.",
        "Katie: Yeah, he is. Is there anything I can do?",
        "Karen: No. No, thanks. Stay out of it. You're happy with Ridge. Just leave well enough alone.",
        "Katie: I wish Bill and Brooke would do that.",
        "Karen: Well, taking the high road has never never really been Bill's strong suit.",
        "Katie: Mm. You know, Brooke is now co-vice president with Ridge.",
        "Karen: That must be interesting.",
        "Katie: It was Eric's idea. He wants them together.",
        "Karen: And Brooke wasn't about to step down.",
        "Katie: No, no. She thinks she deserves the position, and she's not gonna back away.",
        "Karen: Do you think there's more to it?",
        "Katie: There's always more to it when it comes to my sister. Listen, I hate to do this, but I have a meeting downstairs.",
        "Karen: Oh, of course. No problem.",
        "Katie: So good to see you.",
        "Karen: You too.",
        "Katie: And thank you so, so much. Your support, it means so much to me.",
        "Karen: I'll see myself out.",
        "Katie: Okay.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Karen: Hello?",
        "Brooke: Karen, hi. It's Brooke Logan.",
        "Karen: How are you?",
        "Brooke: Good. I was just wondering if we could meet for lunch. I'd like to talk to you about something.",
        "Karen: Sure. Where?",
        "Brooke: Il Giardino. And please, don't tell anybody.",
        "Karen: Okay. I'm on my way.",
        "Hope: I don't think that this was a very good idea, Liam.",
        "Liam: Really? I mean, I thought it was pretty good.",
        "Hope: Okay, but you do know that you don't have to hijack a truck to see me, right?",
        "Liam: Ah. Yes, I'm gonna remember that next time.",
        "Hope: Okay.",
        "Liam: Okay. Here's the thing. We're at a tipping point right now, and if this has taught me anything, it's how easy it is for us to lose each other forever. Could you -- I mean, you tell me -- could you live with that? I couldn't live with that. I love you too damn much, and this is my one shot, hope, to put all these little pieces back together.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Wyatt: Hey! Get your hands off of her. Let's go, hope. And give me the keys to my truck now.",
        "Liam: Truck needs an overhaul.",
        "Wyatt: You really thought this would work?",
        "Liam: Well, I got her here, didn't I?",
        "Wyatt: How pathetic. Kidnapping her. It was the only way you could get some time alone with her. Let's go. Let's get out of here.",
        "Liam: Do you think we could ask her, maybe? Do you want to go, hope? 'Cause you don't have to. This is your home, and it always will be.",
        "Hope: I'm sorry, Liam.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Brooke: Oh, good to see you.",
        "Karen: Oh, you too.",
        "Brooke: Thank you for coming.",
        "Karen: Uh, no problem.",
        "Brooke: I know how busy you are.",
        "Karen: So, what's on your mind?",
        "Brooke: Uh, well, I wanted to talk to you about your brother and my sister.",
        "Karen: That's interesting. Katie and I were having the very same conversation earlier today.",
        "Brooke: Does she know you're here with me?",
        "Karen: No. But why all the secrecy, Brooke? I know you love your sister. After everything the two of you have been through, don't you think it's time to mend fences?",
        "Brooke: I want to do that more than anything.",
        "Karen: So does Katie. So what's the problem?",
        "Brooke: Have you noticed?",
        "Karen: Noticed what?",
        "Brooke: She's been on a power trip.",
        "Karen: The only thing I have noticed is the two of you butting heads over the men in your lives.",
        "Brooke: No, no, it's more than that.",
        "Karen: From what I hear, you're both in love -- you with my brother and her with Ridge. I don't see why you aren't deliriously happy.",
        "Brooke: Let's talk about Bill.",
        "Karen: What about him?",
        "Brooke: You know better than anybody how he lives and breathes his work.",
        "Karen: And your point?",
        "Brooke: Are you happy with the job that Katie's been doing?",
        "Karen: There have been a few hiccups.",
        "Brooke: More than a few, from what I've heard.",
        "Karen: Yes. Well, the source of your information is slightly biased.",
        "Brooke: Karen, he's your brother. I'm sure you would want him to be happy.",
        "Karen: It's his own fault, and there's nothing I can do about it.",
        "Brooke: Yes, there is. I love my sister, and I'm going to work on our relationship and fix that. But I don't think she should be running Spencer publications.",
        "Karen: And who should?",
        "Brooke: You or Bill. And if you don't want to do it, give it to Bill.",
        "Karen: Which would mean...?",
        "Brooke: Firing Katie. Let Bill do what he does best. Hire him back as C.E.O.",
        "Karen: [Sighs]",
        "Janette: And the union rep called. I set up a meeting for you tomorrow, lunch.",
        "Katie: Great.",
        "Janette: Oh, and you have a call waiting. Uh, it's from Singapore -- Mr. Macros.",
        "Katie: Is there anything else?",
        "Janette: That is it, madam C.E.O.",
        "Katie: Thank you. [Sighs]",

        "Liam: Oh, Quinn, what are you doing here?",
        "Quinn: Don't you ever pull something like that again.",
