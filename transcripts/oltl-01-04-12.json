        "John: But you got a car on its way to the Buchanan residence? Good. Keep me informed.",
        "Mr. Evans: I hope they get there in time.",
        "John: Me too. Mr. Evans, I got a strange question.",
        "Mr. Evans: Hmm?",
        "John: Are you sure that's Laurence in that bed?",
        "Mr. Evans: [Scoffs] Absolutely. You see, each prisoner wears a tamper-proof I.D. Now, we scanned his. That's Mitch Laurence. W-w-what are you doing?",
        "John: I'm taking a better look.",
        "Mr. Evans: My god. That's one of my guards.",
        "Natalie: [Gasps] What are you doing?",
        "Mitch: Killing two birds with one bullet. That jezebel's heart is still inside Clint. Oh, I should have killed Stacy Morasco as soon as I discovered she betrayed me. She was supposed to be carrying my grandson, and instead she was having that homosexual's blighted spawn. And for that, she must pay. The Lord has given me the opportunity to stop her heart from bleeding once and for all.",
        "Natalie: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, please! Please. Please don't -- don't hurt him. He's my father, and I love him. Please.",
        "Mitch: Oh. That's very touching, but I'm afraid it's meaningless.",
        "Natalie: No, no, no! Please! Please! Please, please, please, please, please. I'm begging you. I'm begging you. I will -- I will do anything. I will do anything that you want, but just don't -- don't kill him. Please.",
        "Mitch: Anything?",
        "Natalie: Yes, anything. Anything. Just don't kill him. Don't kill my father. [Gasping]",
        "Bo: Go. Clear. Clear. No one's here.",
        "Bo: I know. MacIver's gone. He took Nora with him.",
        "Troy: We're here.",
        "Nora: Well, where are we? Troy? Troy?",
        "Troy: I'm right here. I'm right here. It's okay. So? What do you think?",
        "Nora: Oh, wow. This is lovely.",
        "Troy: Wait till you see the view. Come here.",
        "Nora: Wow. Yeah. Wow. [Chuckles] That's a lot of trees.",
        "Troy: We're deep in the woods, so it's private -- no nosy neighbors.",
        "Nora: Yeah. Though it would be nice to have a corner deli, huh? [Both chuckle] How far away from civilization are we?",
        "Troy: We're in our own little world, but we have everything we need.",
        "Nora: For what?",
        "Troy: For the rest of our lives.",
        "John: Clint! Clint! Hey. Natalie -- where is she?",
        "Clint: He got her, john.",
        "John: Mitch Laurence?",
        "Clint: He has Natalie.",
        "Viki: [Sighs] Oh, good. The power's back on. Clint?",
        "John: [Speaks indistinctly]",
        "Viki: What happened?",
        "John: Mitch Laurence.",
        "Viki: Mitch Laurence was here?! Are you all right?",
        "Clint: Yeah, I'm fine. But the pastor got Natalie.",
        "Mitch: Heed the messenger! I welcome you to the dawning of a new day, a new year! The lord has set me free so that I may lead my flock to a new age.",
        "Sam: Do you know what time it is?",
        "James: Sam, it's urgent. Where's Starr?",
        "Cole: Starr, wait.",
        "Starr: Cole, I can't.",
        "Cole: Don't go, okay? I just got to talk to you.",
        "Starr: What else is there to say?",
        "Cole: Everything.",
        "Bo: Canvass the area. Now, someone must have seen Nora with MacIver. Go. Yes, sir. You got it.",
        "Bo: And thank you. God. [Sighs]",
        "[Knock on door]",
        "Cole: There's so much I have to tell you. We never had time.",
        "Starr: Cole, I'm sorry. I have to check on hope. This will have to wait.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Sam: I don't know where Starr is.",
        "James: All right, never mind. I'll find her myself.",
        "Starr: James? What are you doing here? What's going -- Sam. Go back to bed.",
        "Sam: I can't sleep.",
        "Starr: Do I have to get mom?",
        "Sam: No.",
        "Starr: Thank you.",
        "James: Have you heard the news?",
        "Starr: Uh, well, I haven't been online since before the blackout.",
        "James: There was a prison break.",
        "Starr: Seriously?",
        "James: Yeah. All the locks on the cells are electronic, I guess. And when the blackout happened, the doors just -- they opened. It was a total free-for-all. There's like 200 unaccounted-for prisoners. And they're saying Cole's one of them.",
        "Starr: Oh, my god.",
        "James: So, have you heard from him?",
        "Lindsay: Can I come in? I had to wait for the cops to leave.",
        "Bo: What are you doing here?",
        "Lindsay: [Sighs] You know about the blackout at the prison, right? Bo, troy's on the loose, and I've just got a really bad feeling.",
        "Bo: And you're in on this together, aren't you?",
        "Troy: [Sighs] It's perfect, isn't it?",
        "Nora: Yes. It's wonderful.",
        "Troy: I knew we'd need time-- and privacy. And I wanted it to be special so you'd know how important this is to me, Nora.",
        "Nora: You're making that very clear.",
        "Troy: Wait till you see it in spring. It's so beautiful. And the lake -- the lake is just past those trees. We can fish, swim. We can take walks.",
        "Nora: You know, I don't -- I don't think you remember, troy, but I'm not really a nature kind of gal.",
        "Troy: I remember everything.",
        "Nora: Yeah. I'm gettin' that.",
        "Troy: Don't worry. We have all winter to stay inside. There's no rush. We can just talk. Wow. To see your face... to hear your voice. Nora, it's been so long.",
        "Nora: Yeah, it has been a long time, hasn't it?",
        "Troy: So, you'll give me another chance? We could be happy here, Nora.",
        "Nora: Sure, troy. I'll give you another chance.",
        "Troy: You mean it? Or are you lying to me again?",
        "Mitch: Where is my flock? Gone to the four winds. This church will take great work to be rebuilt. Which reminds me, I have a call to make.",
        "Viki: Clint, are you absolutely sure that Mitch has Natalie?",
        "Clint: I'm telling you, he got her. Mr. Buchanan, if I'm to get a correct reading of your blood pressure, I need you to --",
        "Clint: Aw, the hell with my blood pressure.",
        "Viki: Please let her do her job. I don't want to lose you.",
        "Clint: Viki, we're not gonna lose anybody. Let's just go into the study, Mr. Buchanan.",
        "Clint: All right. To shut you up, I'll go in the study, but you're pushing your luck.",
        "John: Excellent. Call me back. There's an APB out on Laurence.",
        "[Telephone ringing]",
        "John: Why don't you answer it?",
        "Viki: It's Natalie. It's her cell. Natalie?",
        "Mitch: Hello, Victoria.",
        "Viki: Mitch... how's Natalie?",
        "Mitch: She's fine. Aren't you, Natalie?",
        "John: Put her on the phone.",
        "Mitch: John McBain! Oh, it's been too long.",
        "John: Let me talk to Natalie.",
        "Mitch: Ah. If you insist. Here you go, por favor. Tell your boyfriend how you are, Natalie.",
        "Natalie: John?",
        "John: Are you all right?",
        "Natalie: Yeah, I'm okay. How's dad?",
        "John: He's fine. He's with a nurse right now.",
        "Natalie: Church! We're in a church! We're in a church!",
        "Mitch: Natalie, if I'm not mistaken, you, uh, are a forensics expert. Tell me -- how much damage do you think this little pistol could do to your brain?",
        "Viki: Natalie?! Oh, my god. Answer me, honey! Natalie, are you there!?",
        "Bo: Did troy send you to distract me while he takes Nora off who knows where?",
        "Lindsay: No! No, Bo. I swear!",
        "Bo: Where is she, Lindsay?!",
        "Lindsay: What?! Do you think I would take this kind of risk? I had to warn you. You have to believe me -- I'm just trying to help you.",
        "Nora: What, you think I'm lying to you?",
        "Troy: What about the wine?",
        "Nora: Oh, gosh. You didn't like the wine.",
        "Troy: I know you were trying to stall me, Nora.",
        "Nora: What? I was being hospitable. Now, I know that you like merlot.",
        "Troy: Just stop. Stop, okay? I know you sent a signal to him. I know you said something to Bo when you were on the phone -- some sort of code.",
        "Nora: Troy, I was very happy that we had some time alone together, you know? I didn't send him any signal. This isn't making any sense, troy.",
        "Troy: None of this makes any sense! Don't you see? I have risked everything to be here with you, Nora. I love you. You know that, don't you?",
        "Nora: Yes. You've made that very clear. [Sighs] But, troy --",
        "Troy: But what?!",
        "Sam: Freeze! Put your hands up.",
        "Starr: Why would I hear from Cole?",
        "James: Where else would he go? It's not like he has any other family nearby.",
        "Starr: I guess.",
        "James: And where is your phone? I mean, didn't you get any of my calls? Starr, I texted you like 20 times.",
        "Starr: James, my phone died, and I didn't get a chance to charge it because of the blackout. I'm sorry! I'm sorry that I freaked you out, but clearly, I'm okay. And even if Cole did come here, he's not dangerous.",
        "James: Starr, he shot somebody.",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Starr: Wow.",
        "James: Wait. Don't answer the door. What are you doing?",
        "Starr: It's not like he'd ring the doorbell!",
        "James: What about the other 200 felons? [Sighs] Can I help you?",
        "Officer: Sorry, sir. We're looking for a fugitive -- Cole Thornhart.",
        "James: Well, can I see some I.D.? Come on in. They're looking for Cole, Starr. Hmm.",
        "Officer: Have you seen him, ma'am?",
        "Starr: Not since I took my daughter to see him last week.",
        "Officer: You're aware he's at large?",
        "Starr: Yes. Actually, I just found out about the breakout, but I also heard that things are a mess there. Are you sure he's not still on the prison grounds? Maybe he's in the library or something.",
        "Officer: As of yet, he hasn't been located.",
        "Starr: Okay. I just don't see why he would come here. We broke up. I-I have a boyfriend. And Cole knows about him. Why would he come here?",
        "Officer: I can't answer that, but we'll have to search the premises.",
        "Starr: Is that really necessary? My daughter is asleep.",
        "Officer: We'll be quiet, ma'am.",
        "Sam: I said, \"put your hands up!\"",
        "Cole: Sam. It's me. It's Cole... hope's dad. You remember me, right?",
        "Sam: You're supposed to be in jail.",
        "Cole: You're right. Uh... all right. Let's go to the jail.",
        "Sam: No funny stuff.",
        "Cole: Okay. You know what, Sam? Um, sometimes there are things that are more important than following the rules, so I need you to do me a favor, okay? 'Cause we're friends, right? Remember? \"Green eggs and Sam.\"",
        "Sam: I remember.",
        "Cole: Okay. So, um, nobody can know that I'm here, especially the police. This will be our secret, okay?",
        "Sam: I have a friend that's a policeman. His name is john McBain.",
        "Cole: I know john.",
        "Sam: He made me his deputy, so I have to arrest you.",
        "Viki: Mitch, you put Natalie back on!",
        "Mitch: What, so she can tell you where we are? You know me better than that, Victoria.",
        "John: Hey, Laurence-- touch her, and I'll kill you this time.",
        "Mitch: The two of you -- such little faith. Why, I'm a man of god.",
        "John: What do you want?",
        "Mitch: Now, now, lieutenant. This is my call, not yours. And, uh, by the way, there's no point in trying to trace this call, 'cause I disabled the GPS. But as long as you do what I told you, you'll get your girlfriend back.",
        "John: Laurence, you know what I think? I think cowards take hostages 'cause they can't get what they want any other way.",
        "Mitch: I never troubled myself with the means, lieutenant -- just the ends.",
        "Viki: Look, I want my daughter back! Just tell us what you want!",
        "Mitch: Oh, you can have your daughter back, Victoria. As soon as I get mine.",
        "Viki: If you think that I'm going to give you Jessica, you have lost what little sense you ever had.",
        "Mitch: An eye for an eye-- a tooth for a tooth--",
        "Natalie: [Moans]",
        "Mitch: --A daughter for a daughter.",
        "Viki: I am not giving you Jessica!",
        "Mitch: You have one hour. I'll call with my instructions. And, oh, lieutenant, I know I needn't tell you, but, um, no cops, no tricks. Do as I told you--and you'll get your girlfriend--back.",
        "Viki: You are not getting Jessica!",
        "Mitch: It's your choice, Victoria -- give me Jessica, or Natalie dies.",
        "[Receiver clicks, dial tone]",
        "Cole: I just want to spend a little time with hope, you know? Maybe take her to the park?",
        "Sam: My dad used to take me.",
        "Cole: Well-- I'm really sorry he's gone. But you'd give anything to spend another day with him, right? So will you help me spend some time with hope? Please? Don't tell anybody I'm here. Can you do that for me?",
        "James: You seem nervous.",
        "Starr: I just don't want them waking up hope, okay? She was so excited for new year's eve that it took her an hour to get into bed. Is everything okay? W-what's going on?",
        "Officer: No sign of Thornhart, and your daughter's sound asleep.",
        "Starr: Okay, great. Thank you. Well, if you hear anything, you know, when you find Cole, just give me a call because my daughter, hope, will want to know.",
        "Officer: Ma'am, we need to check the rest of the property.",
        "Starr: Of course you do. Of course. Yeah. Go ahead. [Sighs]",
        "James: Are you okay?",
        "Starr: Everything is okay, James! Why?",
        "James: Because something seems off, Starr.",
        "Starr: I'm sorry. What do you mean?",
        "James: Did you lie to them?",
        "Starr: Did I lie to the cops? Are you crazy?",
        "James: It wouldn't be the first time.",
        "Starr: What are you saying?",
        "James: Are you hiding Cole?",
        "Officer: Freeze!",
        "Bo: You don't have a very good track record where troy's concerned.",
        "Lindsay: This doesn't have anything to do with troy. I owe you. I'm not gonna stand by and do nothing when I know you're in danger. Is that the wedding gift I gave you and Nora?",
        "Bo: Yes. Yes, it is. And we've always appreciated it, but don't think that that means that we --",
        "Lindsay: That you don't trust me? Is that what you were gonna say? You don't trust me? What do I have to do, Bo? For god's sake, the very fact that I'm here right now should prove to you that I have accepted your marriage.",
        "Bo: Okay. Let's -- let's assume that you're on our side. Do you know what troy's planning?",
        "Lindsay: I saw him earlier today in the library. He was returning a book. And I just felt like something was up, you know? And I felt like it had something to do with Nora, and I was right.",
        "Bo: Why? W-what did he say to you?",
        "Troy: What aren't you telling me, Nora?",
        "Nora: Okay, troy, I respect you. You know that, right?",
        "Troy: Yes.",
        "Nora: And -- and I cherish a lot of the memories that we had together. You were always kind and thoughtful and gentle. But I-I have to -- I need you to accept what I'm about to say. Because what I'm about to say is the truth.",
        "Troy: I would expect nothing less.",
        "Nora: Good. Now, I appreciate how much you've missed me and how you've cherished our memories, okay?",
        "Troy: Yes.",
        "Nora: [Chuckles] I don't want to hurt you, all right? But I love Bo. And he loves me. And that's why there can never be anything between us.",
        "Troy: You don't know that, Nora.",
        "Nora: No, I do. I do. Because I married him, troy. I-I made a choice.",
        "Troy: Yes! Because I was away! But now I am back, Nora! That's why I brought you here -- so we could start over.",
        "Nora: And I appreciate everything you've done here, the effort that has gone into this. I-I-I do. I mean, it -- it -- you've been incredibly thoughtful. Please. I need you to know this now. Okay? Nothing is gonna change the way I feel. I love Bo.",
        "Troy: You're wrong. And I'm gonna prove it to you.",
        "Clint: If Mitch Laurence thinks he can make a deal with my family, he's wrong.",
        "John: He's got Natalie.",
        "Clint: And he's not gonna get Jessica. He's a maniac, and we all know what he did to her.",
        "Viki: Well, nobody wants him to get Jessica, but the thing is, Clint, he said he was gonna kill Natalie if we didn't meet his demands, so --",
        "Clint: Well, what are you gonna do -- turn over our other daughter?",
        "Viki: Of course not! We have to find another way to save Natalie.",
        "Jessica: I'm the one that he wants, so I'm the one that he gets. John, make the arrangements. Call Mitch and tell him that I'm willing.",
        "Clint: No. You'll do no such thing.",
        "Jessica: Dad, he has Natalie.",
        "Viki: No, Jessica! It is much too risky!",
        "Jessica: So we're just gonna sacrifice my sister?",
        "Viki: No! Of course we're not! We're gonna find another way. John will find out where they are, and -- and-- look, he said it himself -- the only reason he's got a hostage is because he's out of power and he has no options.",
        "Jessica: Which makes him even more dangerous. Look, you know that I'm right. The only way to get to Mitch is through me. Just set a trap and use me as bait.",
        "Clint: Absolutely not.",
        "Jessica: I'm sorry, dad! It's not up to you! We can't lose Natalie.",
        "John: You know I don't want to lose her.",
        "Jessica: Okay, then, so --",
        "John: But your dad's right. We can't get you involved.",
        "Jessica: You show up without me, and Natalie's dead, okay? He will kill her right in front of you.",
        "Viki: Oh, my god.",
        "Jessica: Look, just let him at least see me. We don't have a choice. We have to do this.",
        "Natalie: [Groans]",
        "Mitch: Are you trying to say something? [Laughing] Hold still! I want to help you. There you go.",
        "Natalie: You think that you're a man of god? You've broken every commandment in the book. You lie, you steal, you murder, you rape!",
        "Mitch: Shall I list your sins?",
        "Natalie: Mine?! They're nothing in comparison to a homicidal maniac.",
        "Mitch: All for the greater good. All for the greater good. I will do whatever it takes to save my mission, including desecrating the commandments.",
        "Natalie: Drop the act, Mitch. We both know that you would do whatever it takes to get what you want.",
        "Mitch: You're right. I would even kill you.",
        "Sam: Don't shoot! Who are you talking to, son?",
        "Sam: The bad guy. Son, you need to get back to the house. There was a breakout at Statesville prison, and we've got convicts on the loose. It's not safe for you to be wandering around, even though you're armed. Come on.",
        "Starr: Where am I hiding Cole, James? In my pocket?",
        "James: What, so now you're mad at me?",
        "Starr: You're accusing me of something that I didn't even do!",
        "Sam: Starr, look who I found. The other way around, kiddo. He was in the cabana.",
        "Starr: Sam, I thought I told you to get to bed. And mom says you can't play with --",
        "Sam: There was a prison break. I need it. You need to mind your sister, son. Ma'am, if Cole Thornhart reaches out to you or shows up here, you're to contact us immediately. Failure to do so is a crime. You'd be harboring a fugitive and subject to arrest.",
        "Lindsay: You know, he was just really tense. And I know what that means. I know him very well.",
        "Bo: Yeah, but, Lindsay, did he say anything?",
        "Lindsay: No, he was just really nervous -- really nervous. And I said to him, \"I-I haven't seen you this electrified since you were with Nora.\" And then he said that he was gonna be with Nora again soon. And I -- I thought that was really weird. And then he just started to backtrack right away. He was saying that he -- that he, um, you know, uh, had a parole date coming up in a year and that he was hoping that she would come to it. A-and I just thought something was really off. You know, and I thought it had something to do with Nora. I thought he was lying, and I was right. Then when we had all those brownouts, I got really nervous, and I went and got a guard. But before we could call you, we had the blackout and then the explosion, and then all hell broke loose. And then I saw the guard gate open, and I ran for it because I thought Nora was in danger and I wanted to warn you.",
        "Bo: Yeah, but did he say anything about where he might have taken her?",
        "Lindsay: No.",
        "Bo: [Sighs] Do you remember the title of the book that he had?",
        "Lindsay: It was an electrician's manual.",
        "Bo: Really? And then he said that he was gonna see Nora again soon?",
        "Lindsay: That's what he said.",
        "Nora: Troy, what are you doing?",
        "Troy: It's here. I know it's here.",
        "Nora: Oh, god. Troy, Bo is gonna be looking for you. You're only making things worse by holding me hostage!",
        "Troy: You're not a hostage, Nora! You're gonna love it here!",
        "Nora: No. No. Not like this. Troy, oh, come on. You got to turn yourself in here. I'll vouch for you. We can -- we can -- we can make a better situation for you.",
        "Troy: What are you talking about, Nora? This is perfect! It's you and me in paradise! You're gonna love it here. Now, just give it a chance!",
        "Nora: Not like this. Troy, you are holding me here against my will.",
        "Troy: Now I have everything I need.",
        "Natalie: You think you're gonna kill me? You really think you're gonna get away with that?",
        "Mitch: I need your family to see how serious I am.",
        "Natalie: You kill me now, and you lose what little leverage you have. Why do you want Jessica? You want another shot at making an heir with your daughter?",
        "Mitch: I want to make amends to her.",
        "Natalie: Right.",
        "Mitch: If she forgives me, my people will see that I've changed, and I will be able to rebuild my church.",
        "Natalie: Jessica will never forgive you. None of us will.",
        "Mitch: Well, that's interesting coming from you, Natalie. Let's see what the bible has to say about that. \"Judge not, that ye be not judged. For with the judgment you pronounce, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.\"",
        "Viki: Jessie, I know you love your sister, but I am not gonna let you do this. Over 200 prisoners escaped from Statesville tonight. God knows how many Mitch has already recruited. Even with john there, you could be facing an army of his acolytes.",
        "Jessica: Well, I trust john.",
        "Clint: John already said it's a no-go.",
        "Jessica: Look, I have to do this. We don't have a choice. If these past couple weeks are gonna mean anything, then I have to do this, okay? I didn't patch things up with Natalie to lose her now.",
        "Clint: Natalie does not want you to sacrifice yourself for her.",
        "Jessica: She would do it for me. Wouldn't she? Well, then, I have to do this, okay? Because I couldn't live with myself if something happened to Natalie because I didn't do everything that I could.",
        "James: I got to go. Nate's working, and I promised I'd check on my mom.",
        "Starr: Yeah, it's fine. Go.",
        "James: I love you.",
        "Starr: I love you, too.",
        "James: Oh. Do everybody a favor. If Cole shows up, call the cops.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Starr: I thought I told you to go to bed.",
        "Sam: We lied to the cops.",
        "Starr: \"We\"?",
        "Sam: Cole's in the cabana. I didn't say anything.",
        "Starr: Thank you, Sam.",
        "Sam: I'm not supposed to lie.",
        "Starr: I know you're not. But it's just this one time, okay? Just one night only.",
        "Sam: Cole said it was important.",
        "Starr: It's very important. It has to be a secret.",
        "Sam: Even from James?",
        "Starr: Especially James. I have to go check on Cole, but you understand, right? Nobody can know but you and me.",
        "Sam: Got it.",
        "Starr: Thank you.",
        "Bo: There must be something you missed.",
        "Lindsay: No, no. After he shut down, I did all the talking. I told him Nora was a lost cause because she's in love with you. I told him he had to get on with his life, just move on like I did. I mean, I accept your marriage! I'm happy for you!",
        "Bo: Lindsay, look, that's enough! Okay?",
        "Lindsay: You know, that's what troy said. And then he said that he didn't have to accept it. Because he and Nora and Matthew were gonna be a family again soon.",
        "Bo: He mentioned Matthew?",
        "Lindsay: Yes.",
        "Nora: What's in the bag, troy? What are you gonna do? You gonna drug me? And then what? Rape me or something?",
        "Troy: No! Of course not! How could you even think that, Nora? I would never do anything like that to you. I love you.",
        "Nora: So let me go.",
        "Natalie: I never said I was perfect.",
        "Mitch: Hardly. You slept with your sister's fianc\u00e9 and then lied about carrying his baby. And yet, Jessica forgave you.",
        "Natalie: She's not gonna forgive you.",
        "Mitch: Are you sure? Hmm? I don't think you are. I think you're afraid she will forgive me and we'll be reunited.",
        "Natalie: [Laughs] You know what? Number one, I am not crazy. And, number two, I am not using her to prop up my so-called career as a man of god. She knows that all I want is for her to be happy. But you know what? If you want to prove to Jessica that you really changed, why don't you start by letting me go and turning yourself in? Am I boring you?",
        "Mitch: Oh, no, no, no, no. You're endlessly entertaining, Natalie.",
        "Natalie: What happens whenever the big hand reaches wherever?",
        "Mitch: I call your big boyfriend. This moment",
        "Bo: So, troy said that he and Nora and Matthew were gonna be a family soon?",
        "Lindsay: Yes. But that's not gonna happen.",
        "Bo: No. No, it's not. Because now I think I know where they are.",
        "Troy: What I do depends on you, Nora.",
        "Nora: [Sighing] God. What do you want me to do? Want me to tell you that there's a chance, that there's hope? You want us to sit on the porch swing long enough so that, staring out at the lake in the sunset, I fall in love with you or something? That's not gonna happen, troy. I love Bo.",
        "Troy: Yes. Because I was away!",
        "Nora: Because you were in prison! You were in prison because of things you did to me! I had to pick up the pieces of my life after you left. And I did. I put myself back together. And I fell back in love with Bo. We have a family. And Bo and I -- we've been through hell and back together, and we have stayed together. I love him, troy. There is nothing that could ever make me forget my husband.",
        "Troy: Actually, Nora, there is.",
        "Viki: Jessie, it's wonderful that you and Natalie have made up, but you have to think about your children.",
        "Jessica: Well, what about Liam? Do you want your son to grow up without a mother?",
        "Viki: Nobody wants anything to happen to Natalie! I understand why you want to do this, but, Jessie, you are much too fragile.",
        "Jessica: No! You can't say that anymore.",
        "Viki: Honey, you've made a lot of progress, but Mitch preys on your vulnerabilities.",
        "Jessica: You're right. He does. And I know how he operates, and I am not gonna break this time. I need to do this. I need to do this to prove that I am not a victim. And you can't stop me.",
        "John: I think I can stop you. This is a police procedure.",
        "Jessica: Okay, and it's gonna fail if you don't at least let me make an appearance. He has to see me, to know that we're not tricking him.",
        "[Telephone ringing]",
        "Viki: Hello?",
        "Mitch: You've had your hour. Do I get my daughter?",
        "Clint: It's my daughter.",
        "Mitch: Clint. Is that you? You're still with us?",
        "Clint: No thanks to you, you sick son of a bitch.",
        "Mitch: Look, much as I'd love to catch up, I want my answer. Do I get my daughter?",
        "Starr: Cole?",
        "Cole: Hey.",
        "Starr: [Gasps] Thank god. Sam told me what happened.",
        "Cole: He was a good sport to play along.",
        "Starr: It wasn't easy. I-I-- James was asking me all these questions.",
        "Cole: About what?",
        "Starr: About you! He heard the reporters on the radio, and I had to lie to James. I had to tell Sam that lying to the cops was the right thing to do.",
        "Cole: I'm sorry.",
        "Starr: It's okay. It's okay. As long as they didn't catch you. They could add so much time to your sentence.",
        "Cole: I told you -- I'm not going back.",
        "Starr: You have to. Hope is talking more and more every day, and I already had to cover for her with my parents.",
        "Cole: Thank you. You have no idea how much it means to me.",
        "Starr: Cole, just stay hidden tonight, okay? I'll be back in the morning.",
        "Cole: Wait.",
        "Starr: I can't stay here! If someone comes looking for me --",
        "Cole: I still love you.",
        "James: Sam? You're still up?",
        "Sam: Yeah.",
        "James: Where's Starr?",
        "Sam: I can't tell you.",
        "James: Why not?",
        "Sam: It's a secret.",
        "James: A secret? About what?",
        "Sam: I can't tell you. Then it's not a secret.",
        "James: Well, Starr and I don't have any secrets.",
        "Sam: Yes, you do.",
        "James: What do you mean?",
        "Sam: Starr said I can't tell anyone, especially you.",
        "Starr: Cole, you don't -- you don't have to say that. I know that you're grateful.",
        "Cole: Yeah. I'm grateful. But that's not what this is about. When those gates opened when those gates opened tonight, it hit me. I love you. And I never stopped."
