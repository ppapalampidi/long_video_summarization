        "Phillip brought Emma to the hospital. Rick reported that she just had a cold. Danny, unaware that Michelle was also in the building, pushed the button blowing up the warehouse with her and Eden inside. He took a picture of a bloody Eden which he then presented later to Salerno. Rescue workers retrieved Eden but missed Michelle, camouflaged by the rubble. Tony poked around the rubble and reported to Salerno that Danny had done what was required. Danny later tried calling her, causing her cell phone to ring under the rubble and alert Tony that there was someone trapped under it all. He found her in bad shape.",
        "Billy's car broke down at the hospital. Josh and Reva came to give him a lift. All of them end up going over to give Bill the bad news about Eden being at the warehouse. Eden was pronounced dead by the rescue workers but later showed up in Jeffery's car with Harley - very much alive."

        "Joey: Look, don't go crazy, Tammy, okay? We can do what we need to do without the book, can't we?",
        "Tammy: Sure, but I want everything to be perfect and this book had some really good ideas. I just... I want everything to be right. This letter will guarantee that you get that grant, Joey. It has to be good.",
        "Joey: We do if I want to go to college without making ma work ten jobs.",
        "Tammy: Hey. We are not going to let that happen, okay?",

        "Rick: Oh, not much. But what brings you here?",
        "Billy: Well, I was coming for an A.A. Meeting, but now my car won't start, so...",
        "Rick: Oh, well, I'd love to give you a jump, Billy, but I'm on duty.",
        "Billy: No, listen, it's okay. Josh and Reva are coming over to pick me up.",
        "Rick: All right. Well, listen, it's good seeing you.",
        "Billy: Yeah, good to see you, too. Oh, oh. How's your dad doing in Africa?",
        "Rick: He's not doing too badly, I guess. I've only spoken to him once since he's left.",
        "Billy: Well, he's doing real important work over there. I guess you're pretty proud of him, huh?",
        "Rick: Yeah, Billy, I am. I just wish he'd find some good work closer to home.",

        "Billy: What, and get rid of miss baby? No, no, no. She runs like new.",
        "Josh: She ran like new in 1986, Billy. (Laughter)",
        "Reva: How's Leah?",
        "Rick: Hey, josh. She's doing well. She took her first road trip with her mommy, her brother and her cousin.",
        "Reva: Mel took them on a road trip? The three of them? You've got to be kidding me.",
        "Rick: Mel took her parents along, too.",

        "Phillip: Come here.",
        "Rick: Yeah, what's going on, buddy?",
        "Phillip: Some kind of... can you take a look at her?",
        "Rick: Yeah, sure. What's wrong?",
        "Phillip: Her nose was bleeding. I think something's wrong with her.",
        "Rick: Okay, we'll just... let's just go right inside. I'll take a look. Okay, sweetheart. Listen, just put her in your lap. Kids don't tend to like this part very much.",
        "Phillip: Babies don't get nosebleeds, right?",
        "Rick: Take it easy. She'll be fine. Okay, sweetheart. Come here. Uncle Rick's going to take a listen, okay? Is that okay? How you doing, sweetheart? Okay? She sounds a little congested. Has she been coughing?",
        "Phillip: Some.",
        "Rick: Okay. Has her nose been running?",
        "Phillip: Yeah.",
        "Rick: I see. Okay. I'm going to take a look at your ears, okay? All right. It's just a little thing. Here you go. Okay. Just take a look at this one. Just going to take one look. Okay, ears look good. Ears look very good.",
        "Phillip: What is it?",
        "Rick: I think she just has a little cold. (Baby coos) yes. Yes.",
        "Phillip: A cold?",
        "Rick: Yeah, a cold.",
        "Phillip: Well, don't you think you need to run some tests? Why was her nose bleeding if she's just got a cold?",
        "Rick: It's probably just the dry air. Have this prescription filled and she should be fine in a couple weeks. Did I say a couple weeks? Three days.",
        "Phillip: Are you sure?",
        "Rick: Yeah, I'm sure. Tell your daddy he worries too much.",
        "Phillip: I guess I overreacted.",
        "Rick: Just a little bit, but you know what? Given Lizzie's history, it's understandable.",
        "Phillip: That's what it was. I saw the nosebleed and it just made me think about Lizzie and it just scared me. I'll tell you, this is the one part of my life that's still out of whack.",
        "Rick: Hey, being a parent is a lot of responsibility, pal. Everybody gets freaked out every now and then.",
        "Phillip: Yeah, but it's more than that, because I can handle the rest of it. The tension with Olivia and being back at Spaulding, that's fine. That's nothing compared to this.",
        "Rick: Listen, I hear what you're saying. I mean, I'm going through it myself. My dad, he's gone now. I'm head of the household. Talk about a job I don't want.",
        "Phillip: Is Michelle having a hard time again?",
        "Rick: Danny's apparently back with the mob again.",
        "Phillip: Great.",
        "Rick: Yeah.",
        "Phillip: Can't say I'm surprised.",
        "Rick: It's just so predictable, isn't it? So Michelle asked Mel to take Robbie to uncle mike's house.",
        "Phillip: To keep him safe?",
        "Rick: Looks that way.",
        "Phillip: Do you think something's going on?",

        "Chief: Good. I'm going to keep my guys out until we know for sure. A lot of these warehouses keep chemicals in storage.To\"v nn case, then the first blast probably won't be the last.",
        "Chief: That's right.",
        "Frank: Thanks.",
        "Jeffrey: Frank! I just sent in a team to search for casualties.",
        "Frank: You did what? On whose authority?",
        "Jeffrey: On my authority. My guess is that there was a night watchman on duty and so we want to get him out of there before the place blows again, right?",
        "Frank: You're unbelievable. You sent guys into a building without knowing what they're getting themselves into? Exactly what are you doing here?",
        "Jeffrey: What?",
        "Frank: You know, with due respect, Jeffrey, why don't you leave the decisions about fire- fighting to the professionals who know exactly what they're doing?",

        "Joey: Yeah. Tammy's helping me with my r\u00e9sum\u00e9. I figured I have to work two jobs this summer in order to pay for classes next fall.",
        "Cassie: Oh, I'm sure I can find a job for you here at the hotel, Joey.",
        "Tammy: Mom, Joey's not looking for handouts. Actually, we're both looking for work. We've got to get it together if we're going to afford college.",
        "Joey: Yes.",
        "Cassie: Tammy, I don't want you to worry about paying for college.",
        "Tammy: Mom, I know there's no secret college fund floating around anywhere. I mean, sure, we have the hotel, but it's not like we're rolling in money or anything. Don't worry. Lots of people work their way through college. So I guess that book's not here. Let's just go to company and work it out on paper, huh?",
        "Joey: Okay.",
        "Tammy: See you.",

        "Cassie: The beacon. Olivia. Hi. Yeah, I... what? Okay, well, I think it's great that Phillip wants to take... I know. Emma is his daughter. I know, Olivia. Believe me, I know being a mother can be hard. No, it's fine here. Don't worry about it. Yes, I'm sure. Just keep me posted about Emma. Thank you. Bye. \u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671",

        "Reva: (Laughs)",
        "Josh: Oh, by the way, we ran into bill at the beacon. Apparently, he has a case of cold feet.",

        "Josh: Good point.",
        "Billy: (Laughs)",
        "Reva: Oh, you know, you men!",
        "Billy: Oh, come on. You mean to tell me you never had a case of cold feet in all of your shotgun weddings?",
        "Reva: For starters, I never had a shotgun wedding because I knew exactly what I was doing every time.",
        "Billy: And you're selling bridges today.",
        "Josh: (Laughs)",
        "Billy: Huge ones, right?",
        "Josh: You should have heard the advice she gave bill.",
        "Billy: Oh, yeah?",
        "Josh: Mm-hmm.",
        "Reva: Watch it, mister.",
        "Josh: Hm.",
        "Billy: Reva, I really want to hear what you told my boy.",
        "Josh: Actually, it was to Eden.",
        "Billy: Oh, to Eden. You didn't tell him to tell Eden to buy herself a red dress?",
        "Josh: Keeps things spicy. Isn't that what you told him?",
        "Reva: It does keep things spicy, and you both know it.",
        "Billy: That's a big \"no comment\" here. (Laughs)",
        "Josh: No comment from here, either.",
        "Reva: (Laughs) okay, I've had just about enough from the peanut gallery. Do either one of you have any brilliant ideas when it comes to bill and Eden?",
        "Josh: Oh, my.",
        "Billy: Well, you know, actually, as a matter of fact, I do. I thought they should take their honeymoon at cross creek.",
        "Josh: Well, it's pretty nice up there this time of year.",
        "Reva: I think for once, Billy, you've got a great idea there. What do you think?",
        "Josh: (Laughs) I... hey, the smell of daisies in the air and the spirit of H.B. And Miss Martha. I think it's a fabulous idea.",
        "Billy: Okay, well, I'll bring it up to them.",
        "Reva: Eden is a lucky gal.",
        "Billy: Yeah, and I think bill is, too. I didn't really take to Eden at first, but she's going to make a real fine addition to this family. \u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671\u0671",

        "Jeffrey: Yeah, I heard. Listen, Frank, about earlier. I'm sorry if I overstepped, but, you know...",
        "Frank: Yeah, well, you may have saved a life.",
        "Jeffrey: Let's hope so. So what do you think? Do you think this was an accident?",
        "Frank: Well, your guess is as good as mine. You know about these old buildings. They go up all the time.",

        "Phillip: Right. So? Olivia controlled everything for months. I'm just taking back some of that control.",
        "Rick: Sounds like another war coming on, which makes me ask the rhetorical question: Why are you married to this woman?",
        "Phillip: As I told you before-- we've been through this-- she's my wife.",
        "Rick: Yeah, so you say.",

        "Olivia: This is your game. This is your new game. You're going to make me worry like I made you worry.",
