        "Danny: Hi. Careful you might get hit. Whoa! Missed. If you stick around long enough, we might all get lucky.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, I don't trust mother nature anymore than I do human nature. Take you for example. One minute you own a house, next minute it belongs to your cousin tony. It doesn't bother you.",
        "Danny: He paid cash. Here you go. Hey, you. Can I join you? What was that for?",
        "Michelle: That was for that little light house and the building permit.",
        "Danny: Oh, yeah. Oh, that, yeah.",
        "Michelle: You made it happen, danny.",
        "Danny: Well...",
        "Michelle: And now tony and i can get ready to get our renovation started.",
        "Danny: Good. I'm glad. Because you know I've been doing a little renovating myself.",
        "Michelle: Yeah?",
        "Danny: Yes, I have. When I handed the deed of my house over to tony, I kind of realized I don't need my house. I don't need my car. I don't need my suits. I don't need my watch. I don't need my cell phone or my wallets or the shoes on my feet. I don't need anything at all. Except you.",
        "Lizzie: Granddad, please tell me who the winner of the contest is.",
        "Alan: Now listen...",
        "Lizzie: Excuse me? Can we help you?",
        "Coop: Yeah, I'm looking for the coopers. Harley, frank, marina. You know them?",
        "Alan: You may want to try across the street at the hospital. I'm sure they're there wit their father buzz. I assume you heard about buzz.",
        "Coop: Yeah, that's why I'm here.",
        "Lizzie: Well, wasn't he a rude one. Now listen, okay, back to the contest. I will let you vote on my shares until I'm 30. You've just got to tell me who the winner is, please? Until I'm 40.",
        "Alan: Elizabeth, you will find out who the winner tonight is at dinner. And that is final.",
        "Lizzie: Well, will you at least tell me who the finalist are? You don't trust me?",
        "Alan: Of course I trust you, darling. But look, I will tell you this. Tammy's in the lead and joseph's in second.",
        "Lizzie: No. Granddad, joey can't be in second. He's got to win.",
        "Tammy: I've got water, soda, fruit juice and tea. So what can I get for you?",
        "Steve: How about another driver?",
        "Joey: Sorry. The road gets better up ahead.",
        "Tammy: Maybe we should take the highway?",
        "Joey: No, no. The highway is too much traffic. So you must be tired, huh? Long flight?",
        "Steve: Yeah, well, I'm waking up pretty quickly back here.",
        "Joey: Here. Some tunes to get you to the awards dinner.",
        "Tammy: Oh, no, no, no. This is much better. Simulated surround sound.",
        "Joey: Digital is as good as gets.",
        "Tammy: Soprano sound track. Uncle junior sings.",
        "Steve: Yeah, so I heard.",
        "Joey: Yeah, which is probably why you want my downloads.",
        "Tammy: So what do you want to listen to?",
        "Steve: I want both of you to shut up.",
        "Buzz: Why is everything in plastic cups?",
        "Harley: Because they're trying to measure how much food you eat.",
        "Buzz: I wouldn't feed this to the stray behind company.",
        "Harley: Please, dad, just take one bite.",
        "Buzz: Really. You first.",
        "Harley: He's back.",

        "Buzz: I might be dead come daybreak.",
        "Nurse: Make sure he's stays calm. No excitement.",
        "Harley: Would you stop? You're not going anywhere. You had your chance to die and you blew it. As a matter of fact when you get out of here, you are doing hard time at my place with me and frank and marina and the boys. So get used to it.",
        "Marina: (Laughs)",
        "Buzz: I'll do it.",

        "Jeffrey: Oh, yeah, that'll be a regular riot.",

        "Jeffrey: Oh, really?",
        "Cassie: Set another place for dinner.",
        "Jeffrey: Cassie?",
        "Cassie: It's a done deal, o'neL. I'm going to guess that you like steak and potatoes? Hmm? (Laughs) okay.",
        "Edmund: Well, we need more silverware.",
        "Rj: For who?",
        "Edmund: Mommy's friend.",
        "Harley: My father needs to stay calm. He can't afford to become anxious.",
        "Harley: You're the one who's anxious.",

        "Marina: Thanks. See you later.",
        "Buzz: Hey, what's the rush?",
        "Marina: The doctors said that we had to keep visitors to a minimum. Family members only.",
        "Buzz: Well, gus is family members. Isn't he?",
        "Harley: Whatever you want, dad.",
        "Buzz: Well, I want you two to get over the past. If you were lying here like me, would it matter that much or would you just love him anyway?",
        "Harley: The man is obviously heavily medicated.",
        "Gus: Look you need your rest. I'm going to... I just wanted to... I'll stop by tomorrow.",
        "Buzz: You let him walk away, I'm going to cut you out of the will.",

        "Buzz: Get him back here.",
        "Harley: Thanks for coming. It means a lot to him. My dad.",
        "Gus: Well, he's a great guy.",
        "Harley: You know why this is so hard? It's hard because I want you here, okay. I need you here. I don't want you to go. But I can't let you stay.",
        "Gus: I understand.",
        "Harley: I know you understand. You're the only who does understand. That's why it hurts because you weren't just the man I was going to marry. You were my best friend.",
        "Gus: And I'm still am.",
        "Harley: You're not. You're one of them. You're a spaulding.",
        "Gus: Look, I wasn't going to tell you this, okay. But the night of your father's surgery...",

        "Harley: Oh, my god!",

        "Tammy: I told you we should have taken the highway.",
        "Joey: Sorry. Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. What did you guys want me to do? Hit the tree that was in the middle of the road?",
        "Steve: At least it would have ended our misery.",
        "Tammy: Can you believe this? We could be at that awards dinner right now making all kinds of points with alan spaulding, but no. Instead we're here.",
        "Steve: You're flooding the engine, lupo.",
        "Tammy: Oh, like it'll do any good to tell him? He does whatever he wants no matter who gets hurt.",
        "Steve: Yeah, well, guys are pigs sometimes, you know. Now can we get moving?",
        "Joey: I wasn't trying to hurt anybody. Steve, will tell her I was never trying to hurt her.",
        "Steve: He wasn't trying to hurt you.",
        "Tammy: So I suppose lizzie doesn't matter then?",
        "Steve: Lizzie? Who's lizzie?",
        "Joey: She's a friend.",
        "Steve: Lupo, there's friends and there's friends.",
        "Joey: She's a friend friend.",
        "Steve: He says she's just a friend.",
        "Tammy: Then why does he hang out with her all the time?",
        "Steve: Lupo?",
        "Joey: Because, well...",
        "Tammy: Why can't you just admit it that you like her.",
        "Joey: I do like her. But not like how I like you.\u00e9@",
        "Tammy: You don't know what you want. Maybe it's whoever's handy.",
        "Joey: You see what I'm talking about? The moment I start telling her the truth she starts freaking out.",
        "Tammy: I am not freaking out.",
        "Joey: You are too freaking out. Tammy, what do you want? What do you want from me?",
        "Steve: Lupo, for god's sakes just give her a kiss so we could get out of here.",
        "Alan: Well, elizabeth, you really care about this joseph, don't you?",
        "Lizzie: More than anyone I've met before. Like he's probably the only guy that treats like I'm not a spaulding.",
        "Alan: And that's a good thing?",
        "Lizzie: Well, you know what i mean. It's not easy having money and being special. Everybody resents you. And I don't know. He sees me. Likes me for me and what's inside. And I really love him for that.",
        "Alan: Well, let's not go overboard with this.",
        "Lizzie: You don't understand, granddad. He's got to win, okay. He's smart, he's special. He just deserves to be with us.",
        "Alan: And if joseph should win?",
        "Lizzie: Then he'll see that we're not any different and we can date for real.",
        "Alan: What about tammy?",
        "Lizzie: I sort think that tammy's kind of habit for him. And honestly I think she's holding him back.",
        "Alan: No, I wasn't referring to that. But doesn't bother you that she deserves to win?",
        "Lizzie: No, because joey deserves it a lot more.",
        "Alan: You are a spaulding, young lady. You're already pulling a few strings.",
        "Lizzie: So is joey in?",
        "Alan: You will find out tonight at the dinner. Now I've got to go and make some phone calls, but whatever happens, you will get what you want. You always do, young lady.",
        "Lizzie/alan: (Laughs)",
        "Michelle: So I thought you'd be really down, you know, after having to sell your house to tony.",
        "Danny: Yeah, well, I was. I was down. But then I realized that my dream for us doesn't involve houses or things. It's about you and me and robbie being together and sharing our life together. So I spent the last few days selling off the rest of the 5th street.",
        "Michelle: You're not serious.",
        "Danny: Yeah, I cashed out. I'm dead free. (Laughs)",

        "Danny: Mm-hmm. Yep. Worse than that.",
        "Michelle: Wow.",
        "Danny: Well, my cousin ray would say that it will either break my spirit or set me free. But I don't know. Right now I'm feeling strangely bird like. You want to fly with me?",
        "Michelle: Where to?",
        "Danny: I n't know. Anywhere. We'll just pick a spot and go.",
        "Michelle: You're so different right now.",
        "Danny: Different. How? Good different? Bad different? What was that for?",
        "Michelle: Following me. I just can't seem to find my way back. But you came after me, didn't you?",
        "Danny: Now we both lost.",
        "Tony: No, no, I haven't seen the changes yet. But I will... well, we'll let you know what we think, all right? Okay. I'll call you back.",

        "Jeffrey: Oh, there it is again. That great hospitality of yours.",
        "Edmund: Oh, don't worry, mr. O'neill, we won't turn you out in the storm. You're more than welcome to stay here. After all you did save cassie from the terrible imposture and accomplices. I for one couldn't thank you enough.",
        "Jeffrey: (Laughs)",
        "Harley: I can't believe this. Daddy's going to light up when he sees you.",

        "Harley: Yes.",
        "Coop: Wait a minute. Whoa! What took you guys so long to let me know that he was in the hospital.",
        "Harley: Oh, please, you know dad and frank. They think you're five. They're still trying to protect you. When did you get so tall? Look at you. And you're beautiful.",
        "Coop: Stop. Bradshaw eyes. Yeah, I know. You say the exact same thing every time.",
        "Harley: Oh.",
        "Coop: Then comes the questions, how's your brother doing?",

        "Joey: Keep dreaming, winslow.",
        "Tammy: Joey, how could you say something like that?",
        "Steve: You know excuse me a second. You know, I don't pretend to be a genius, but I can't figure out why you two aren't together. Because you're sure fighting like people that want to be.",

        "Tammy: We need you.",
        "Joey: Please.",
        "Steve: No. You guys don't need me. You need each other. You know, if you're smart you'll sit there until you could figure that out. Lupo, wisen up, would you?",
        "Tony: It's not that big a deal, but the architect made some changes on the blueprints. So... do you know what? Listen. Wait. I'm going to order some take- out. So I will see you guys later.",
        "Michelle: Wait, tony. Hang on. Sit in a seat.",

        "Tony: Really?",
        "Lizzie: Okay. See there's this party I'm going to with this guy and it just so happens he's a little on the shy side, and I was kind of hoping maybe you had something that would open him up.",
        "Tony: Lizzie, you're asking me for drugs?",
        "Lizzie: Or something that will do the same thing maybe?",
        "Tony: Do me a favor and get out of here.",
        "Lizzie: But you have to know somebody who could...",
        "Tony: I said get out of here before I call your mother and your father. Boo.",

        "Harley: You care enough to visit, but you don't care enough to save the restaurant?",
        "Alan: This is not the time or place for that conversation.",

From the moment she saw my face, richard's face, she's been crazy for me hasn't she? Of course she felt sorry for you, so she hasn't told about her true feelings for me.
