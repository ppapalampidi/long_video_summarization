    "Transcript": [
        "Sam: I finally got the boiler working.",
        "Carly: Great.",
        "Sam: For the time being, anyway.",
        "Carly: Well, it's good to have the heat back on.",
        "Sam: Yeah.",
        "Carly: Now all we need are some warm bodies in here. We need customers, sam. We need customers now.",
        "Sam: You know, the only way we're going to get a crowd in here is if we have live music.",
        "Carly: I think you're right. So it's a good thing that we have a band booked for the week. And let's just hope that business picks up once they get here, or the only music we're going to have is me singing the blues.",
        "Sam: Well, it may come down to that. This band is the last one we have booked.",
        "Carly: Well, who are we going to get to perform for the rest of the month?",
        "Sam: You know, I happen to have some contacts in chicago. And I was thinking that maybe, you know, you and I could take a little business road trip and see if we can find some new talent and get this place packed. The sooner, the better.",
        "Carly: You want us to go to chicago?",
        "Sam: Yeah. Yeah, kit can hold down the fort, and I think we can find some real talent.",
        "Carly: Oh, boy. I'd love to go to chicago, sam, but I can't go with you.",
        "Craig: Oh, looks like emily's picking up right where dusty left off, throwing a lot of wild accusations around, sticking her nose in where she doesn't belong. After what happened at the contract signing, memo 21 can't handle any more bad publicity.",
        "Chris: Oh, I know, I know. Ever since we broke up, emily's been out to get me. And now, she's got paul ryan doing her dirty work for her.",
        "Craig: They're a bad combination. We're going to have to watch our backs.",
        "Chris: I'm not going to let emily stewart ruin my reputation at the hospital.",
        "Craig: That's all the more reason for you to get back to memorial, focus on the good work you're doing there.",
        "Chris: Can I leave it up to you to handle paul and emily?",
        "Craig: Yeah. I'll take care of that.",
        "Chris: What are you planning?",
        "Craig: Nothing. I'm just going to protect my investment, that's all. I'm not going to let emily stewart or paul ryan get in our way.",
        "Emily: Why do I listen to you? I made it worse going to margo. It was just a mistake.",
        "Paul: Did you tell her about chris?",
        "Emily: Yes, I did.",
        "Paul: And she didn't buy it?",
        "Emily: No, she didn'T. She didn't buy it. I think I made things worse for myself, because now, if chris is innocent, I'm the prime suspect.",
        "Paul: All the more reason for you to get the goods on chris and his involvement with craig. That way, we clear your name.",
        "Emily: Clear my name? That would be really nice. I mean, it's a nice sentiment, but I really don't think that's going to happen this time.",
        "Craig: You know, if you are trying to clean up your image, i would suggest you drop your new accomplice.",
        "Paul: Oh, that's rich. Craig montgomery's giving you advice on how to maintain a reputation.",
        "Emily: What do you want, craig?",
        "Craig: I just think you should be careful making accusations you can't back up. Throwing around false rumors, that's very dangerous, emily. Especially for you. Since all those nasty, dirty rumors about you? Those are all true.",
        "Meg: Luke. I didn't know you went out.",
        "Luke: Noah's in there studying for a test. I thought I would surprise him with a rocky road banana split. It's his favorite.",
        "Meg: Paul always loved rocky road.",
        "Luke: You miss him, don't you?",
        "Meg: I miss the way things might have been.",
        "Luke: Well, is there any chance for the two of you?",
        "Meg: No.",
        "Luke: Do you still blame him for the -- for the miscarriage?",
        "Meg: No, no, it's not that. I'm just making some big changes in my life. I need to move forward, not back.",
        "Luke: Oh, I get that. I do. But, you know, it's really hard finding someone to love. I guess that's why I'm so happy that I have noah.",
        "Meg: Have I told you how happy I am for you?",
        "Luke: Well, thank you. But, look at my mom and dad for instance. You know, things were really tough with them, and now my dad's accused of this murder that we all know he didn't commit. And my mom is sticking by him. All I'm saying is that life is hard. Why make it harder by choosing to be alone?",
        "Carly: Of course, it would be nice to get out of oakdale and hear some music. But, you know, with the troubles that parker's been having lately, I can't leave town. And I can only imagine how he would react if he knew that I was going away with you. I mean, it was hard enough for me to explain to him why you'd still be working here.",
        "Sam: Well, I suppose you wouldn't have to mention it to him. We're only gone for a few days.",
        "Carly: Of course I'd have to mention it to him. I wouldn't keep a secret like that.",
        "Sam: I understand. You're right, I'm sorry. I don't want to force anything --",
        "Carly: Why don't you go to chicago with kit? You know, you haven't had any time alone with her since she's been back. And you know, it could be a business trip and romantic getaway, huh?",
        "Sam: Yeah. Are you sure that it's okay if we left town? Leaving you here all alone.",
        "Carly: Oh, of course it's okay. And you do want to spend the time with kit, right?",
        "Sam: Oh yeah, of course. In fact, I was going to suggest that in the first place, but I just didn't want you to think that I was, you know, taking advantage.",
        "Carly: Don't be silly. You've been working so hard here, you deserve a break. So why don't you go get yourself packed, and I'll give kit the good news.",
        "Paul: Did you just threaten emily?",
        "Craig: You tried to pin dusty's murder on chris. But all that was a smokescreen to protect yourself.",
        "Emily: If chris had something to do with dusty's murder, it would be criminal not to report my suspicions.",
        "Craig: You know, this whole scorned lover routine is getting old. You need new material. Oh, and you, paulie -- you seem willing to just back anybody who's willing to take me on. Now I gotta admit, I really do admire the plot. You know, you get the good doctor on trumped up charges, you both get what you want. You get revenge on a lover, you get a blow at montgomery enterprises. But I will tell you both one last time that it won't succeed. So, back off. Or you will pay the price.",
        "Emily: Wow, he was in rare form.",
        "Paul: You know, I heard evan and chris talking last night. And I think they're staring to feel the pressure.",
        "Emily: So in order to protect his investment, craig is protecting chris.",
        "Paul: Either that, or he's protecting himself.",
        "Lily: No wonder neil was so paranoid about being followed. The killer must've been trailing him when he came to meet me.",
        "Holden: I told you it was too dangerous for you to go alone.",
        "Lily: Oh, my god, if I had gotten there a little earlier -- that could've been me dead in that trunk.",
        "Holden: From this point on, i am not letting you out of my sight.",
        "Margo: Well, I just got the forensics report from the autopsy on that lab technician. It's just preliminary results, but apparently he died of a lethal injection.",
        "Lily: Just like dusty.",
        "Margo: Yep. It's a great possibility. We won't know for a few hours. The lab will call us back. But it seems that you two have found yourself in the middle of another murder. So, shall we call a lawyer before we begin questioning?",
        "Lily: What are you saying? You think we had something to do with this? Captioning sponsored by procter & gamble productions, inc. And cbs here's why beano is different than these gas relievers.",
        "Holden: Do you really believe that we're capable of killing someone?",
        "Margo: Well, holden, you have already been charged with one murder. And it's the same mo.",
        "Lily: Holden did not kill dusty.",
        "Margo: You two are right smack dab of yet another murder in this town. How -- how did you stumble across this body?",
        "Lily: Neil. Neil called me. He said he wanted me to meet him. He said he had some information on an investigation he was conducting for dusty.",
        "Holden: Right. And dusty told this neil guy to contact lily if anything happened to him.",
        "Margo: What was he doing for dusty?",
        "Lily: All I know is he was analyzing some residue found on a coffee mug. And neil must've had some evidence to back up dusty's claim, or he wouldn't have tried so hard to reach me. He was adamant about meeting me alone, which makes me believe that he knew how serious his involvement was in all of this.",
        "Holden: That's everything we know. What have you found out about this guy?",
        "Margo: His name is neil perkins. He is the lab technician that donovan was calling repeatedly the night that he was murdered, and we've been trying to track him down ever since.",
        "Holden: And whoever found out about neil's investigation would stop at nothing to make sure that those results don't go public.",
        "Margo: Mm-hmm, that's quite a little motive you got there, holden. You two and donovan were the only ones that were in contact with perkins.",
        "Holden: Do you really believe that we would turn ourselves in if we were responsible for his murder?",
        "Margo: Stranger things have happened.",
        "Paul: Look, we both know what craig is capable of, and it's not like he hasn't attempted homicide before. And I just feel with everything that he's lost, especially in the last couple months, he's going to protect whatever he has left by any means necessary.",
        "Emily: When are you going to get over your obsession with craig montgomery? Honest to god, any time something bad happens, you automatically assume he's to blame. Not that he's not capable of absolutely anything.",
        "Paul: Exactly. At the very least, he's linked to dusty's murder. If nothing else, he could lead us to whoever really did kill dusty.",
        "Emily: Okay, so what's the bottom line?",
        "Paul: The bottom line is, we figure out who killed dusty, and we can both reap the benefits.",
        "Meg: I am not choosing to be alone, I'm just turning a corner in my life. First, I need to untangle myself from craig, personally and professionally. And I need to take stock. I need to figure out what I really want to do. I know I can't be with paul. We just can't give each other what we need.",
        "Luke: But you still love him, don't you?",
        "Meg: It's complicated. Look, right now, I know I need to be here for my family. Especially for holden.",
        "Luke: You know, that's what i really love about this family. We all stick together. Noah never had that. I think that's why he likes living here so much.",
        "Meg: You two are getting closer, aren't you?",
        "Luke: Well, not as close as we'd like. Grandma's rules -- separate bedrooms.",
        "Meg: Is that a problem?",
        "Luke: I don't know, maybe it's good. You know, taking things slow.",
        "Meg: Well, it can be more exciting that way.",
        "Luke: Yeah, I guess. Noah and I are invited to this party at a lake house. But then we heard that it was going to be pretty wild, so we decided not to go. The first time noah and I are together, I want it -- I don't know, I want it to be special.",
        "Meg: Well, it sounds like you made the right choice.",
        "Luke: I guess so.",
        "Meg: You know, if you do want a relationship to last, you can't rush it. You have to make sure that he's the one.",
        "Luke: Oh, I'm pretty he is. We just -- we fit together. You know, like, I like him, he likes me. Emotionally, intellectually, I just feel like we really balance each other out.",
        "Meg: Yeah, I know exactly what you mean. You know, when you are with the right person, your strengths and weaknesses balance out. With paul, it felt more like we hit each other's weaknesses.",
        "Luke: Well, I know you'll figure out what you want, aunt meg. You deserve to be happy. You sure I can't entice you with a delicious banana split?",
        "Meg: No thanks, I think I'll pass.",
        "Luke: I guess you just have to wait until mr. Right comes along.",
        "Meg: Yeah, thanks. I know I'm making the right choice, so I'll just see where it takes me.",
        "Luke: Well, I hope it takes you somewhere good.",
        "Meg: Yeah, me, too. Because one of these days, I want to be as happy as you are.",
        "Luke: You will.",
        "Carly: Your girlfriend seems very excited to spend some quality time with you on the road. She's already booking your hotel rooms.",
        "Sam: Yeah, that's my kit cat.",
        "Carly: Sounds like you're gonna have a really nice time.",
        "Sam: Don't worry. Our first priority will be booking bands.",
        "Carly: Of course. I know you won't let me down, sam. Now, would you mind watching the place for a little while? Parker had a session with his tutor, I have to pick him up, and I promised I'd get him some hot cocoa on the way home.",
        "Sam: Sure, no problem. Take your time.",
        "Carly: Thanks.",
        "Sam: There we go. Yeah, can I speak to the band manager, please? You guys are booked at metro this week. And I'm sorry, but something has come up, and we're going to have to cancel. I know, I know. It turns out, we just don't need a band. Sorry about that.",
        "Carly: Hey. How was your session?",
        "Parker: It was okay.",
        "Carly: Just okay? You know, we got you that tutor to help you get your grades up. Maybe what you need is incentive.",
        "Parker: What do you mean?",
        "Carly: Well, kit and sam are going out of town for a few days on business, so I'm gonna be on my own at the club. It'd sure be nice to have somebody there to help me. So here's the deal. If you pass that science test tomorrow, then you can come and work at metro for me after school. Now, it'll just be for a few hours, and you still have to do all your homework. But I'll pay you just like any other employee. What do you think, is that incentive enough?",
        "Parker: I guess that'd be okay.",
        "Kit: Baby, get ready to hear some of the sweetest sounds your ears have ever heard. I'm sure the bands will be good, too.",
        "Sam: Oh, I just wish we had taken this trip a week ago. And then we wouldn't be in the pickle that we're in right now.",
        "Kit: Don't tell me --",
        "Sam: The band that we booked just canceled at the last minute.",
        "Kit: Oh, you've got to be kidding me. They're supposed to bring in a big crowd.",
        "Sam: I know.",
        "Kit: Did they tell you why they had to pull out?",
        "Sam: No, no, they just said they were sorry that they had to cancel.",
        "Kit: If we don't have somebody on stage tomorrow night, this place could lose more than we could afford.",
        "Sam: I know. I wish there was something I could do. You know, I'd offer to play the gig myself, but we're going to be in chicago.",
        "Kit: I guess our romantic getaway is a no-no. We have to stay here and be on stage, baby. I don't see any other way out. At least with you here, we can break even for the week.",
        "Sam: But what about all those appointments that you set up in chicago?",
        "Kit: I guess I'll just have to go scouting on my own. You can stay here with carly and the bar.",
        "Margo: You two are free to go. But I don't think I have to remind you, don't leave town.",
        "Lily: You really don't think that holden did this, do you?",
        "Margo: I want to find another suspect. You two aren't making it easy.",
        "Holden: Let's go.",
        "Dallas: We just finished searching perkin's condo. We got his computer with a bunch of files on the hard drive, and some old documents we found in his home office. We're going through everything to find any clue about the work he was doing for dusty.",
        "Margo: Okay. Let's just hope it gives us something that leads us to a killer.",
        "Dallas: Wait, are you taking lily and holden snyder off the suspect list?",
        "Margo: No, no, I'm not, I'm not. But you know, they don't fit the profile. And they said themselves, why would they turn themselves in? So, I guess we have to start looking for another suspect.",
        "Dallas: Okay. What about emily stewart?",
        "Margo: No -- emily stewart. She's the only one who actually has an alibi. She was here with me when perkins was killed.",
        "Dallas: All right. Well then, who does that leave on the suspect list?",
        "Margo: My brother-in-law, chris hughes.",
        "Paul: Montgomery enterprises stands to make millions on the memo 21 project. That to me is profit enough to be motive for craig to commit murder.",
        "Emily: And since he's funding the entire project, it makes sense that he would want to keep all the negative publicity off of chris.",
        "Paul: You need to go get whatever you can from craig.",
        "Emily: Wait, wait, wait. I'm sorry, what did you just say? I need to? Why me?",
        "Paul: Yeah, well, because if I go do it, then there'll just be another murder for someone else to come run around and try to solve.",
        "Emily: Fine, fine, fine, I will go. What are you going to do?",
        "Paul: Me? I think I figured out a way to finally end craig's reign of terror.",
        "Emily: How are you going to do that?",
        "Paul: By hitting him where it hurts.",
        "[Knock at the door]",
        "Meg: Paul, you really shouldn't have come here.",
        "Paul: Meg, you gotta hear me out. Is that the hearty chicken rotini diet?",
        "Carly: Of course, you're underage, so it's not like you're gonna be serving martinis, but there are plenty of things that you can do.",
        "Parker: Can I be a bouncer and work the rope line at the door? Let in all the hot chicks. Or I could help the bartenders get ice.",
        "Carly: That sounds more like it.",
        "Parker: You know, working here is going to be cool.",
        "Sam: Hey.",
        "Carly: Hi. Sam, thank you so much for watching the place while I was gone. Now you can go and pack. Parker and I can take it from here.",
        "Sam: Well, actually, there's been a slight change of plans. The band that we booked just canceled.",
        "Carly: We have a party, don't we? We guaranteed them live music. I don't want to lose that reservation.",
        "Sam: I know. Kit and I talked about it, and she thinks that I should stay here and play the gig. And she'll end up going to chicago by herself. I know that's not what you wanted, but at least now we won't lose any money.",
        "Parker: I knew sam would never leave. Forget the job. I don't want it.",
        "Lily: This feels like a complete nightmare. Why do I feel like the worst is yet to come?",
        "Holden: I think what you need to do is get some rest. You know what? I'm going to call your mother.",
        "Lily: Why do you need to talk to my mother?",
        "Holden: Lily, I think you should get out of town and just let all of this blow over.",
        "Lily: I can'T. Not now. I thought we were in this together.",
        "Holden: Two people have been killed, and I don't want you to be next.",
        "Paul: How are you?",
        "Meg: Fine. You know, busy getting my life back together. You?",
        "Paul: You know, we could do that together --",
        "Meg: You know, don'T. Don'T. Paul, please, I can't go through this with you again, okay? And if that's why you came here, you're just wasting your time.",
        "Paul: No, actually, I came here because I want to talk to you about craig. I think he might be behind dusty's murder.",
        "Meg: Nothing ever changes with you, does it? You're still out to get craig. Well, don't expect me to help you.",
        "Emily: I know I'm the last person you want to hear from, but I'm here to tell you that you are making a huge mistake backing chris hughes.",
        "Craig: Really? And why is that?",
        "Emily: Because the new face of your little investment happens to be a murderer.",
        "Craig: Is that so?",
        "Emily: You're investing in a man who tried to kill his own father, craig, and then murdered dusty donovan because he found out about it, and possibly the lab technician who was found dead in the trunk of his car because someone -- hmm, who could it be -- found out he was holding information for dusty.",
        "Craig: Emily, I know that you publish a tabloid, but that story is too farfetched even for \"the intruder.\" Why are you telling me this? And why do you think I would care?",
        "Emily: Because I know that craig montgomery wants to back winners. And you, my friend, are betting on the wrong horse. Chris hughes is going down, so if you were smart, you would get out while you can. Otherwise, you and your little company are going right down with him.",
        "Paul: Meg, I'm not out to get craig or anybody else. This is really -- you know, this just has to do with holden, really.",
        "Meg: Holden?",
        "Paul: Yes, your brother's being charged with dusty's murder. And I thought that if we could prove that craig had something to do with it, then holden would be off the hook.",
        "Meg: Right. Holden had nothing to do with dusty's murder, and I would bet the farm that the police will discover that any moment now. What I am curious about, though, is why you felt you had to come all the way out here to share your suspicions about craig with me.",
        "Paul: Meg, look, I know that you were close with dusty, and your brother is being accused of murdering him. Silly me, I thought you might want to who might really be responsible.",
        "Meg: Okay, so if that were true and craig is guilty of murder, why not just go to the police? Why come to me? It's not like there's anything i can do.",
        "Paul: Actually, meg, there is.",
        "[Alarm clock beeping]",
        "Carly: Parker! Would you give me a second, please?",
        "Parker: Can't you see what this guy is doing, mom? He's making up every excuse that he can to be alone with you!",
        "Carly: Parker, I think that you're overreacting. Sam wanted to go away with kit. He was really looking forward to it. The only reason he's staying is because the band canceled on us and we needed somebody to fill in. Sam didn't deliberately do any of this. Now honey, with kit gone and sam performing, I'm going to be short-staffed, so if you'd still like to work with me, I'd really --",
        "Parker: No way.",
        "Carly: I wish you could see that sam's just trying to help.",
        "Parker: Yeah. As long as that guy's there, I don't want to be.",
        "Carly: Okay. Can I at least get you that cup of hot chocolate I owe you?",
        "Parker: No thanks. Gotta go.",
        "Carly: Can I have a medium hazelnut, milk, one sugar, please?",
        "Sam: All right, there you go. Thanks for coming in. What can I get for you?",
        "Singer: How about another gig? You canceled us at the last minute.",
        "Sam: Whoa. Yeah, sorry about that. Something came up. I'll tell you what, though. We can book your band some time next month.",
        "Singer: How do I know you won't cancel us again? I mean, we had to turn down a bunch of other gigs to play here. Which is why we expect to be paid the full amount.",
        "Sam: Well, that's not going to happen. See, cash flow's a little tight right now. But the best we can do is reschedule you sometime next month.",
        "Singer: This is a rip-off. You know, I want to talk to the owners. Get them out here.",
        "Sam: They're not here right now. Look, I'll tell you what, I will pay you for the first night only. There you go. But after this little run in, you better not show your face around here again.",
        "Singer: I don't plan to.",
        "Parker: I knew you were a liar.",
        "Sam: What're you doing back here again?",
        "Parker: I just saw you pay that guy off. And I was right all along. You're just trying to get close to my mom. And now, I have proof.",
        "Meg: I really have no control over what craig does anymore. I never really did.",
        "Paul: Actually, you do. You still own his company, don't you?",
        "Meg: On paper, maybe. But I don't want to be associated with craig anymore. And that's why I'm meeting with the lawyer to finalize transfer of the company back to him.",
        "Paul: No, no, no, meg. You can't do that. You can'T. Look, as long as you control craig's company, you control his money. Montgomery enterprises is bankrolling evan walsh and the research that they're doing at memorial for chris hughes. Without craig's support, the project will fall apart.",
        "Meg: So what does this have to do with dusty's murder?",
        "Paul: Look, for some reason, dusty was trying to stop the research that they were doing at the hospital. And craig never would've stood for that.",
        "Meg: Do you really think craig killed dusty?",
        "Paul: Well, I'm not sure. But look, if you separate craig from his company, then the project will fall apart, and then someone will show their true colors, and maybe we'll catch a killer.",
        "Meg: You know, why should I even consider doing this for you, and put myself in the middle of you and craig again?",
        "Paul: You don't do this for me. Do this for yourself. It's a chance for us to figure out who really killed dusty. And if it works, holden will be in the clear. It's just -- it's just something for you to think about.",
        "Craig: You are so predictable, emily. You're throwing around accusations just to take the heat off yourself. But it's not going to do you any good.",
        "Emily: You sure about that?",
        "Craig: Face it, emily. When it comes to trying to kill people, you have a track record that's very hard to beat. Now, you're running scared. And I don't blame you. You see, you had an affair with dusty donovan, and it went bad in a very big, very public way. And think that if anybody's going to be implicated in his murder, that would be you.",
        "Chris: I can't believe this. My own sister-in-law is accusing me of committing murder.",
        "Margo: Well, I'm not the one making the accusation.",
        "Chris: No, no, but I know who is. Emily. But why would you listen to her?",
        "Margo: Because it's my job. When someone makes an accusation, I have to investigate. And if you're innocent, and I certainly hope that you are, you'll be clear.",
        "Chris: Well, considering the source of these so-called allegations, you should have rejected them. You of all people -- why would you listen to her? You know how she operates.",
        "Margo: Yes, I certainly do. But I'm trying to find a murderer here. So I'm going to keep asking questions until I find him. Or her.",
        "Lucinda: What's going on? I got your message, darling.",
        "Lily: I think you'd better sit down.",
        "Lucinda: Oh no, please, don't keep me in suspense.",
        "Holden: Last night, we got a call from a lab technician who was working with dusty. He said he had information for us.",
        "Lily: But by the time we could catch up with him, he was -- he was dead. We found his body in the trunk of a car.",
        "Holden: He was killed with what appears to be the same lethal injection that was used on dusty.",
        "Lucinda: Are you two all right?",
        "Lily: Yes.",
        "Holden: Yes, yes. Luckily, lily wasn't hurt.",
        "Lucinda: Did you go to the police, dear?",
        "Lily: Of course we did.",
        "Holden: Look, there's a pattern here. It started with bob's stroke. Dusty gets suspicious. Then dusty is killed. The lab technician that dusty's working with also gets killed. Lily was a link to all this. I'm afraid that she might be next.",
        "Lucinda: No, no, we can't let that happen.",
        "Holden: I agree. We need to figure out who did this.",
        "Lucinda: Dusty was right all along. I should've listened to him.",
        "Holden: You said he suspected that there was foul play at the hospital.",
        "Lily: Mother, you're on the board. I mean, what could be going on at the hospital that would make someone so desperate they'd want to kill for it? u saw, but I guarantee",
        "Sam: I don't know what you think you saw, but I guarantee you've got it all wrong.",
        "Parker: No, I don'T. I've been watching you, and now I can prove to everyone what a creep you are.",
        "Sam: You have nothing, parker. And besides, who would believe you at this point? You have called me out so many times and always been proven wrong. And I guarantee this time will be no different.",
        "Parker: Why don't we find out, then?",
        "Sam: Go ahead. And while you're at it, why don't you tell your therapist? Yeah, I heard you were seeing one. I guess that means everybody thinks you're a little crazy. Take my advice -- stop telling stories. Otherwise, your parents will have to send you away. Is that what you want?",
        "Parker: What I want is for you to leave my mom alone!",
        "Kit: Hey.",
        "Carly: Hi. I thought you were busy packing.",
        "Kit: Yeah, I was. I just thought I'd take break. Listen, I'm glad I caught up with you. I just want to say I really appreciate you letting sam stay here in oakdale. I know jack and parker ain't exactly keen on the guy.",
        "Carly: Well, I think as long as we keep parker away from sam, we'll be all right.",
        "Kit: I hope so. You know, it's great being back with sam. I guess being away kind of made me realize just how crazy I am about him. I really missed him. We've been together a long time, and we've been through a whole lot.",
        "Carly: Well, I think it's great that you guys are still together. I know it's a lot harder than it looks.",
        "Kit: Yeah, sure is. I know that sam has a roving eye, but I overlook it. It don't mean nothing. He's just a big old flirt, that's all.",
        "Carly: As far as I can see, sam only has eyes for you.",
        "Kit: Yeah. Well, if sam gets interested in another woman, then that's where I draw the line, you hear what I'm saying?",
        "Carly: I don't think you have to worry about sam.",
        "Kit: Great. It's good to know I can trust you with my man, carly. I can trust you, right?",
        "Carly: Definitely. You don't have to worry. Sam is all yours.",
        "Sam: I don't think your parents would be too happy if they knew you snuck back in here just to spy on me. In fact, I doubt they'd even listen to what you'd have to say.",
        "Parker: They'll believe me. Don't worry.",
        "Sam: Parker, when are you going to get it? I'm not such a bad guy. If you keep your mouth shut, I won't tell your folks about your little spy games here.",
        "Parker: Yeah, I don't need any favors from you.",
        "Cowboy jack: I told you that kid was trouble. You're gonna have to do somethin' about that nosey little brat.",
        "Sam: And I know just what to do. But you're not going to like it.",
        "Paul: How'd it go?",
        "Emily: It was a complete waste of time. I didn't get through to craig. I mean, nothing I said seemed to bother him. In fact, he managed to turn everything around on me. How'd it go with meg? Hello! How'd it go with meg?",
        "Paul: I think it went great. Yeah, I think I finally got through to meg. And I think craig's gonna lose his company, and memo 21 is going to lose its funding, and the whole research project at the hospital's gonna fall through. And then, if that happens, hopefully somebody's going to get ticked off enough that they show their hand. Then -- then, we can catch ourselves a killer.",
        "Lucinda: Well, the biggest thing that's going on at the hospital that's new right now is the memo 21, spearheaded by chris hughes. But -- no, I mean, and son of bob hughes is incomprehensible that he'd be capable of doing anything.",
        "Holden: Well, is there anything to lead you to suspect someone else?",
        "Lucinda: Darling, if I had suspected anyone, I would have gone to the police.",
        "Holden: All right, in the meantime, is it possible for you to take lily out of town? I don't want anything to happen to her.",
        "Lucinda: Yes, absolutely. I think that's an excellent idea. I know a wonderful medical spa.",
        "Lily: Do I get a say in this?",
        "Holden: No, you don'T.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Lucinda: Just a minute. Hang on. No. Yeah?",
        "Meg: Lucinda? Can you come out to the farm? I need to see you right away. And there's something we really need to discuss.",
        "Lucinda: Actually, I am rather busy at this time.",
        "Meg: It's urgent.",
        "Lucinda: Okay, I'll be there.",
        "Lily: Is everything all right?",
        "Lucinda: I will be all right. You will be all right. We will be all right. I promise. Graduates lil entrees are...",
        "Sam: Hey there, beautiful. I was just checking the boiler.",
        "Kit: What's up with the lights?",
        "Sam: Well, we didn't have any customers, so I thought we'd just shut down for a while. I figured you and I could use a little alone time before you left town.",
        "Kit: You read my mind.",
        "Sam: Well, you seem to be in a good mood.",
        "Kit: I am, baby. I feel real good. Maybe you can bring cowboy jack along and he could tell me a joke or two so I have something to remember you by on the road.",
        "Sam: No, no, no, no, let's leave cowboy jack out of this. It's just you and me. Besides, cowboy jack is busy doing his own thing.",
        "Meg: Hi. Thank you for coming here so quickly.",
        "Lucinda: Well, you said it was urgent.",
        "Meg: Okay, I've been doing a lot of thinking. Trying to get my life back in order and trying to put things right again. I know you were cheated out of your company when craig gave it to me. And I know, I accepted it. But the truth is, I had no right to it. In fact, I don't want it anymore. And I was going to give it back to craig, but that won't be making things right.",
        "Lucinda: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Just a moment. What exactly are you trying to say to me?",
        "Meg: If you want the company, lucinda, it's yours.",
        "Lucinda: That's wonderful. That's absolutely -- I'm so glad that the thinking has been productive. That's just wonderful. I think you've done absolutely the right thing. I just wish that you'd done it months ago, before --",
        "Meg: Before what?",
        "Lucinda: Oh, it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter anymore. That doesn't matter. What matters is the company is in the right hands -- mine. Okay, fine. Tomorrow morning, then? We'll settle the legal paperwork. That's wonderful news. Thank you.",
        "Meg: You're welcome.",
        "Lucinda: Thank you. It's mrs. Walsh, here. I need to see you right away.",
        "Chris: You went to the police? I just got done getting the third degree from margo, asking me about a dead lab technician. Apparently someone's been saying that I'm a murderer.",
        "Emily: All right, just calm down --",
        "Chris: I know exactly what it is you're trying to do and you are not going to get away with it. The gloves are off. Consider yourself warned.",
        "Paul: Well, for someone who says he's innocent, he sure acts like he's got a lot to hide.",
        "Lucinda: We're going to call the whole thing off.",
        "Announcer: On the next \"as the world turns\" --",
        "Gwen: She kidnapped our child. We're here to get her back.",
        "Aaron: It's time to go back, sofie.",
        "Sam: I hate to even say this. Was it your son again?",
        "Parker: Tell them the truth, you creep. Tell them you set me up!",
        "Holden: Margo, something's happened to lily. I'm afraid that she might be in danger."
