        "Brooke has to separate Ridge from Rick. Stephanie lashes that if Ridge wants to be mad at someone, make that Brooke as she knew the kids were still seeing each other and did nothing about it. Ridge feels betrayed and can't believe that Brooke wouldn't respect his feelings the way she seems to respect the kid's feelings. Brooke won't back down and insists on speaking to Rick alone. She lectures him and advises him to break it off with Phoebe before things spiral even further out of control. Stephanie harks to Ridge this is Brooke's fault and you don't start a marriage based on lies. She reminds Phoebe that she owes her father an apology. Phoebe does apologize. She wanted him to treat her like an adult, then she sneaked around behind his back. Ridge claims he could have handled it better too. But he and Brooke are in opposite camps when it comes to her wanting to leave Rick and Phoebe there alone to work this out. And she's not just ASKING him. Stephanie is shocked that Ridge would accept Brooke turning the tables on him, after lying about this situation. Going home, Ridge is indecisive and wants to turn the car around and go back. Brooke demands that he not, leave the kids alone; they need this time alone and they are going to give it to them. He's still incredulous that she knew about this all along. Yet she berates him for that look in his eye and she will NEVER tolerate him trying to strike her son again. He surmises SHE lied to him, yet he's the bad guy here. Rick is sullen and quiet and Phoebe tries to persuade him that her dad will come around eventually. He thinks they have put his mother in a very touchy situation. Phoebe doesn't want him to go on this guilt trip. She says her dad will come around eventually. And his mom won't lose Ridge because of this. They have to stop worrying about what everyone else says. She begs him to just love her.",
        "Nick feeds Taylor hot, spicy soup in bed and reassures her that Brooke is his past, just like the boat. Nothing Brooke says or does will affect his feelings for Taylor or shake his world at all. He likes the way he feels now and what he sees when he looks at Taylor. After making love, he doesn't want to think about anything else and she says she's found the man she wants to be with."

        "Brooke: Let him go! Let go of my son now!",
        "Stephanie: Let him go, ridge. If you're going to be angry with someone, be angry with Brooke. Because she's known about it, and she's lied to you the whole time!",
        "Nick: Who are you calling?",
        "Taylor: Phoebe. Her cell phone's out of range.",
        "Nick: Are you worried about her?",
        "Taylor: Well, after that garbage Stephanie said --",
        "Nick: Will you forget about that old windbag? Coming over here stirring up trouble -- your daughter's fine. She takes after you, she's going to be okay.",
        "Taylor: What's this?",
        "Nick: I noticed you didn't eat much earlier. So I thought I'd heat you up this soup. Open. Hmm? What?",
        "Taylor: It's spicy.",
        "Nick: Just like you, baby. Sorry. I'll get you something else.",
        "Taylor: No, it's good. I don't need anything else. I just need you. Just you. Can you say the same about me?",
        "Ridge: Did you know about this?",
        "Rick: Mom had no idea that Phoebe and I were up here.",
        "Ridge: That's not what I'm asking.",
        "Stephanie: Oh, she knows.",
        "Ridge: Tell me, Brooke. Did you know that your son and my daughter were still involved?",
        "Brooke: Yes.",
        "Stephanie: At last, the truth.",
        "Brooke: I tried to make you see that Rick was not a threat to Phoebe, and he's not.",
        "Stephanie: You should have ended it, Brooke.",
        "Brooke: I tried!",
        "Stephanie: Oh, please --",
        "Phoebe: Dad, I know this is really hard for you to understand, and I'm not even sure Brooke understands entirely, but -- I mean, she could see how hard it was for us to let go.",
        "Ridge: How could you do this? How could you do this? How could you not tell me the truth?",
        "Brooke: I tried to tell you. I came to your office, and you were too busy being concerned about Jarrett and him finding out! I love Phoebe very much. She's like my own daughter. But I told you before, you cannot force them not to feel what they're feeling.",
        "Stephanie: Oh, for God's sake.",
        "Brooke: They needed time to work things out, Stephanie.",
        "Ridge: So you gave it to them. Without telling me. Brooke, I'm her father. You had no right to do that!",
        "Brooke: And you had no right to threaten to kill Rick because he wouldn't back off!",
        "Ridge: Come on, you know I didn't really mean that.",
        "Brooke: And yet I walk in here and you've got your hands all over him, manhandling him!",
        "Stephanie: Oh, so that excuses what you've done?",
        "Brooke: Don't even bother trying to understand this, Stephanie.",
        "Stephanie: Don't try and blame other people for your lack of judgment.",
        "Ridge: The point is, you know what it's like trying to raise a teenage girl. There's no manual to go by. There's no way of knowing if what you're doing is right. You just have to do what you believe in your heart is best and hope to God that it is. That's why I can't step away, Phoebe. And that's why I wish that you had respected my feelings in all this. As much as you respected theirs.",
        "Brooke: I need to talk to you in the other room.",
        "Rick: Mom, don't.",
        "Brooke: Right now!",
        "Stephanie: Even if she intervenes, it's too little, too late. She's lied to you the whole time, and you don't base a marriage -- a good marriage -- on lies.",
        "Nick: Are we back to that again?",
        "Taylor: No, no, we're not.",
        "Nick: If Stephanie hadn't waddled over here with the sole purpose of spewing her opinion about Brooke --",
        "Taylor: Well, there was a time --",
        "Nick: But that time has come and gone. And I've told you that, or words to that effect. What do I have to do to make you believe that?",
        "Rick: Mom, I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry. The last thing in the world I wanted was for this to blow up like it has.",
        "Brooke: You said you'd be careful.",
        "Rick: I know that! Mom, we thought that coming up here to this cabin would be the safe thing to do. How was I supposed to know that that battle-ax and ridge would find us up here?",
        "Brooke: What matters is that they did. And now Stephanie's determined to turn it into something ugly, when it isn't!",
        "Rick: And you know why. Because she's trying to destroy you and ridge just as much as Phoebe and me.",
        "Brooke: Ridge is still Phoebe's father. Now, I know she's not a kid anymore, but parents still care about their children when they get older.",
        "Rick: Stop -- stop. I understand you're a parent, and you get how ridge feels, but I thought you understood how Phoebe and I feel.",
        "Brooke: I do. But ridge thought that you weren't involved anymore. Now he finds out that you're still seeing each other and I knew about it!",
        "Rick: What, so that gives him the right to attack me physically?",
        "Brooke: No, my God, there is no excuse for that ever! But ridge comes up here and finds you two in the cabin alone -- how's he supposed to react? Now, I know that you have the best of intentions. But sometimes, when you meet somebody, and you have these feelings, all of those good intentions just go right out the window. And things happen. I know you care about Phoebe. And I know that Phoebe cares about you. And you don't want to see her getting hurt anymore than you want to put her in some kind of bad position, like sneaking around behind her father's back!",
        "Rick: This was her idea, to come up --",
        "Brooke: I don't care whose idea it was! You are the mature person here, and you should be responsible! Now, I'm going to tell you what I told you before. Break it off with Phoebe, now. Before it spirals out of control and things get even worse than they are already.",
        "Stephanie: You owe your father an apology.",
        "Ridge: Mother --",
        "Phoebe: Dad, grandma's right. I asked you to treat me like an adult, and I'm lying and I'm sneaking around behind your back. I was wrong, and I'm sorry.",
        "Ridge: Sweetheart, I'm not exactly blameless in all this either. I know I probably could have handled it a lot better. But when I found out that Rick had dragged you up here --",
        "Phoebe: Dad, he didn't drag me up here. I wanted to be with him.",
        "Ridge: When you were born, I knew that I would walk through hell and back to protect my little girl from the slightest harm. That's what parents do.",
        "Phoebe: I know, and that's what you've always done, Dad. I mean, when I scraped my knee, you bandaged it. And you were there when I woke up from a nightmare. And you've always protected me. But when you look at me now, you still see that little girl. And even though part of me will always be that -- your little girl -- you're wrong about Rick.",
        "Ridge: We'll talk about it more in the car on the ride home.",
        "Phoebe: Dad, I'm not leaving without him.",
        "Brooke: We should let them talk, alone.",
        "Stephanie: What?",
        "Brooke: I trust my son, Stephanie.",
        "Ridge: You're asking me to leave my daughter up here with this guy after what I walked in on?",
        "Brooke: I'm not asking. Thanks for calling dell. What can we build for you ?",
        "Brooke: Rick has some things to say to Phoebe, and we're going to let him.",
        "Stephanie: Is that an ultimatum?",
        "Brooke: We'll drive back in your car, and Stephanie can take mine.",
        "Phoebe: Dad, it's okay. You don't have to worry. We won't --",
        "Stephanie: No, you won't, young lady. Because you're going to go home with your father.",
        "Brooke: Phoebe and Rick, we'll see you both later.",
        "Stephanie: Are you going to let her turn the tables on you like that? After she's lied to you about this whole situation?",
        "Taylor: I believe you, Nick.",
        "Nick: Tell me again.",
        "Taylor: I do believe you, it's just complicated.",
        "Nick: See, I don't agree. I think it's completely uncomplicated. All we have to do is put some duct tape over Stephanie's mouth. Whatever happens with Forrester and Brooke and their relationship has got nothing to do with me and it will not shake my world at all. Because I haven't been this happy in -- I can't remember when. Because of you, because what we've found together. You know, there's no games. There's just no agenda. When I look in your eyes, I believe what I see. And I like your mind and your heart. And I like what I see when I look at you. And I like the way I feel when I touch you -- and kiss you.",
        "Phoebe: I can't believe they found out where we were. I mean, especially since we took different cars. But you know, I think maybe it's a good thing that my dad knows now -- I mean, I hated lying to him. And I know Brooke did too. Anyway, I mean, now that everything's out in the open, it's a huge relief. We don't have to hide our feelings anymore. And you feel the same way, right? Rick? Rick? Talk to me.",
        "Ridge: What the hell am I doing, leaving Phoebe up there with that -- I'm going to turn the car around.",
        "Brooke: No. They need this time and we're going to give it to them. Rick knows what he has to do.",
        "Ridge: Oh, that's supposed to ease my mind? Damn it, Brooke. Why didn't you tell me it wasn't over between those two?",
        "Brooke: Pull over.",
        "Ridge: What?",
        "Brooke: Pull over to the side of the road. We are going to get something straight once and for all. So I'm on that roasted chicken Italiano diet.",
        "Taylor: What are you thinking about?",
        "Nick: Are you serious? After sex like that, I'm not thinking anything.",
        "Taylor: That's okay. You can admit it.",
        "Nick: Admit what?",
        "Taylor: You were thinking about her. You miss her.",
        "Nick: Her?",
        "Taylor: The other love of your life. The marlin. She was your first love, right?",
        "Nick: Ahh -- yes, yes. Gone she is. She will be missed.",
        "Taylor: I know it won't be easy letting her go.",
        "Nick: No, no, never is. But that is my past.",
        "Taylor: We'd better be talking about the boat.",
        "Nick: Okay, one last time. I mean it, one time. Brooke is my past, just like the boat is. And don't think that you're out of the woods either. As psychopathic as Stephanie, she's going to come to you and she's going to want you to hook back up with ridge --",
        "Taylor: Oh, no. No --",
        "Nick: You know she will --",
        "Taylor: No, no, that's never going to happen. No way. No. Ridge blew it. I found where I want to be. I found the man I want to be with. Besides, it's absolutely ridiculous that ridge would even come to me -- that ridge and Brooke would split up at this late date. It's absurd.",
        "Nick: Do you like talking about this?",
        "Taylor: No.",
        "Nick: Then shut up and kiss me. Thank you..",
        "Ridge: So, what is this tone of yours? Back until now. I didn't want to do this in front of the others. I mean, it was bad enough that Stephanie was there. But when I walked in, and I saw your hands on my son -- my God, ridge, that look in your eye -- it's like you wanted to hit him. I never want to see that look again.",
        "Ridge: You were the one who was lying to me and I'm the bad guy? Is that what its come to now?",
        "Brooke: I will not tolerate you striking Rick. If you're angry with him, you work it out in words. But I never, ever want to see you attempt to hit my son again. Ever. Is that clear?",
        "Ridge: Okay.",
        "Brooke: Okay, what?",
        "Ridge: Okay, I will not let what happen tonight ever happen again. But I also want you to be aware of something. Think about this. What does it say about us, that you feel the only choice you seem to have, is to lie to me?",
        "Phoebe: Rick, why won't you talk to me? Did I do something?",
        "Rick: No.",
        "Phoebe: Then what? Is it my grandmother or my dad? Wait, wait, wait. When Brooke asked to talk to you alone, what did she say? Rick? Rick?",
        "Rick: We put her in an impossible situation, Phoebe.",
        "Phoebe: No. My father put us in an impossible situation. Asking us not to feel this way. I mean, now that he knows it was just -- it was way too much to ask, then --",
        "Rick: It doesn't mean that he's ever going to change his mind about us.",
        "Phoebe: No, don't talk like that. My dad will come around eventually.",
        "Rick: Phoebe, please -- please.",
        "Phoebe: Look, I know, okay? I know it's still complicated. But we have -- I mean, it's not about my grandmother. And if it's not about my dad, these are our feelings. They're our lives. Okay? All we're asking them to do is -- look, okay, your mom will not lose my father over this. All right, yes, he's angry at her that she didn't tell him, but they've been through worse than this. I mean, they'll get through this too. So, if Brooke was trying to put you through some guilt trip -- forget about my father. Forget about whatever your mother said. We have to stop thinking and worrying about what everyone says. I love you. I mean, I love that thought of us even. Please. Just love me."
