        "Olivia: I think spaulding has offered you more than a fair price for your property, mr. Pierce. They can cut you a check tomorrow. What do you say? Do we have a deal?",
        "Mr. Pierce: Well, normally I'd like a little more time.",
        "Bill: ( Clears throat ) spaulding will take more than your building, mr. Pierce. They'll take your soul. Bill lewis, lewis construction. I can make you a much better offer.",
        "Tony: Hey, babe. The judge is waiting. He's got the full line. But guess what? I, of course, pulled a few strings. So...",
        "Michelle: You know, I didn't mean to make such a big thing about all of this.",
        "Tony: No, hey. Listen, listen. It is a big thing. It is. The divorce is final. That means later on tonight you are going to be mrs. Tony santos. ( Laughs )",
        "Passenger: Adorable little boy. Is he yours?",
        "Danny: Yeah, his name's robbie.",
        "Passenger: And that pretty lady, is she your wife?",
        "Danny: Was. Was my wife. We're divorced.",
        "Frank: Hey.",
        "Marina: Hi.",
        "Frank: How's my beautiful daughter doing?",
        "Marina: Hi.",
        "Frank: Marina? Is everything okay?",
        "Marina: Yeah. Yeah, danny just flew off to vegas with michelle to get their divorce.",
        "Frank: Isn't that kind of good news?",
        "Marina: I don't know. Danny called me a while ago and he told me that he was on his way home and when he got here, we needed to talk. So it doesn't sound good, does it?",
        "Gus: So, you're mallet the ex.",
        "Mallet: Harley and I were married a long time ago.",
        "Gus: Yeah, I know all about it.",
        "Mallet: Harley told you about me, huh?",
        "Gus: Told me you cheated on her. Let me get this straight: When i was at the prison, you knew exactly who I was but then you pretended to be somebody else.",
        "Mallet: I thought it would be easier.",
        "Gus: Easier than what? Admitting that you're at that prison just so you can be closer to her?",
        "Harley: Whoa, whoa, whoa. What are these for? You know what? I need to get back to my cell. I really do.",
        "Guard: Pipe down.",
        "Harley: But what about the warden? I mean, if the warden... if the warden finds out that I didn't finish my work, he's going to be... wait, don't leave me in here. What are you putting me in here for? Why am I here?",
        "Olivia: Excuse me, bill. Mr. Pierce and I were in the middle of something.",
        "Bill: A shakedown. Don't be fooled by the champagne and cleavage, mr. Pierce. This is a good, old-fashioned mugging.",
        "Olivia: I bet your pardon.",
        "Bill: Spaulding doesn't even know the meaning of fairness. They do everything on their terms. Now, lewis, on the other hand, we can offer you...",
        "Olivia: Cash up-front. And we'll buy that property on baxter road that you've been trying to unload.",
        "Bill: We can match that offer and give you an extra $25,000.",
        "Olivia: $50,000.",
        "Pierce: I think...",
        "Olivia: You want to turn this into a bidding war, that's fine by me. May the deeper pockets win, sweetheart.",
        "Bill: Oh, then I guess the question is, how much do you care about money? Because for some people, money means the world, but for others, integrity is what really counts.",
        "Olivia: Oh. People who act morally superior are usually the world's biggest hypocrites.",
        "Bill: Are you telling me you never said one thing and then did another? Watch out for this one, mr. Pierce. She'll charm the pants right off you.",
        "Olivia: At least I keep my pants on. No, it's lewis you can't trust, mr. Pierce, because as soon as they give you some kind of commitment, they go behind your back with someone else.",
        "Bill: Oh, you do not know what you're talking about.",
        "Olivia: Oh, please!",
        "Bill: And then you barge ahead and then blindly took action, following your usual scorched earth policy.",
        "Olivia: Scorched earth?",
        "Bill: Yeah.",
        "Olivia: Oh. Are you telling me you're on fire, bill? Because I can cool you off. Here.",
        "Bill: ( Laughs weakly )",
        "Olivia: ( Gasps )",
        "Frank: Look, marina, when a guy tells you that he wants to talk to you, that could mean a lot of different things.",
        "Marina: Yeah, most of them bad. Especially when he can't tell you on the phone.",
        "Frank: You don't know that. Come on, honey.",
        "Marina: I just think I need to prepare myself. You know? I mean, there's a good chance that danny's just having second thoughts about us.",
        "Frank: Given that guy's track record, I would think you would be the one who should be giving him secondugs. Don't you think?",
        "Marina: Yeah. How did I know you were going to say that?",
        "Frank: Because I'm your dad and I love you. And I think you should be with somebody who appreciates you. Now, there are millions of guys out there...",
        "Marina: ( Sighs )",
        "Frank: Not that I want you to go through a million guys, but come on, that don't have his baggage.",
        "Marina: I don't like all of those other guys.",
        "Frank: Yeah, I know that.",
        "Marina: I like danny.",
        "Frank: Look, honey, as much as I would love to be your sounding board, maybe you should talk to somebody else about this, you know? Talk to your grandfather. He's a little bit more flexible than I am.",
        "Marina: Yeah, I already did. I don't know. I guess I just wish I could talk to harley.",
        "Frank: Yeah, me too. Listen, I got to go upstairs and get something. Are you going to be okay?",
        "Marina: Yeah.",
        "Frank: I love you, kiddo.",
        "Marina: ( Sighs )",
        "Danny: Hey.",
        "Tony: I happen to be the luckiest man alive. I cannot wait to marry you, babe. I can'T. Hey. Michelle? What's wrong? Talk to me.",
        "Michelle: Um...",
        "Tony: What's wrong? Huh?",
        "Judge: Sorry, folks. Another couple has dibs on this room this hour.",
        "Tony: Sir, you told us that we could wait in here before this...",
        "Michelle: It's okay. It's okay. It's all right. We'll leave. Can we just have another minute?",
        "Judge: Sure.",
        "Michelle: Thanks.",
        "Tony: What's going on?",
        "Mallet: You know, the warden job is just a gig, man.",
        "Gus: Hm. And larley is just an inmate, right?",
        "Mallet: You don't know if you can trust me. Okay, I get it. You know what? I can deal with that.",
        "Gus: Well, just tell me this. Why that exact prison? And why did you feel that you couldn't tell me who you were?",
        "Mallet: I should have come clean with you earlier, but i wanted to talk to you, gus, before your defenses went up. I was curious about you.",
        "Gus: Why?",
        "Mallet: Same reason you're curious about me. Frank. It's me. Oh, frank, it's good to... before you sock me, I apologize, okay?",
        "Frank: You were my best friend. We were buddies. And you hurt my sister. You broke her heart.",
        "Mallet: Then hate my guts, frank, but I don't see what good it'll do. Come on, man. Come on. What do you say? Let's just say that the past is the past.",
        "Frank: What the hell are you doing here?",
        "Gus: I wouldn't do that if i were you, frank.",
        "Frank: Really? Like I'm going to listen to you after what you did to my sister. You know, this is really choice. This is perfect, actually. Why don't you guys form a club?",
        "Gus: Because mallet is the new warden at harley's prison.",
        "Frank: What? What the hell are you trying to pull?",
        "Mallet: All I want is to help harley.",
        "Harley: What are you doing here, alan? How much does it cost to bribe a guard these days?",
        "Alan: Well, it's nice to see you're still full of spunk, harley. Of course, you've only been here just a few days.",
        "Harley: Is that why you're here? To gloat?",
        "Alan: I'll cut to the chase. I know that gus is still obsessed with you, and I also know that he's been here to see you.",
        "Harley: Look, that's his choice. That's not my choice. I told him I don't want to see him. I've tried discouraging him.",
        "Alan: Try harder.",
        "Harley: You're so easily threatened, alan?",
        "Alan: You destroyed phillip and I am not going to allow you to destroy gus. You stop hurting my son or i promise you that I will make your stay here in prison more painful than you can possibly imagine.",
        "Pierce: I don't know what's going on between the two of you, but obviously it has nothing to do with my property.",
        "Olivia: Oh, no, no, mr. Pierce. Don't go.",
        "Bill: Mr. Pierce, if you just hang out a little longer. What are you doing?",
        "Olivia: You scared him off.",
        "Bill: Oh, who, me? The guy in the wet t-shirt contest over here?",
        "Olivia: Who? Who? Who interrupted my meeting?",
        "Bill: \"Who, who, who, who, who. Atre an ow , that was ridiculous. All right, listen. I guess we weren't so professional just now.",
        "Olivia: You think?",
        "Bill: But never mind that, because I need to talk to you about something important.",
        "Olivia: Like?",
        "Bill: Like emma.",
        "Olivia: What about emma?",
        "Bill: I miss her, olivia, and she's got to be wondering why i haven't been around.",
        "Olivia: Well, you know, I was going to tell her, but she doesn't know how to pronounce \"adultery\" yet.",
        "Bill: I love that little girl, and I don't want her thinking that I deserted her, olivia.",
        "Olivia: She doesn'T. She's been asking about you. And she's not hurt, she's just confused. Like I am.",
        "Bill: Well, I don't want that, you know? So, when can I see her?",
        "Olivia: I'll let you know. I think that she would be very happy to see you, because things have been very hard for her since we moved out.",
        "Bill: I know how it feels.",
        "Olivia: You just have a way of making a girl feel safe.",
        "Bill: Emma doesn't feel safe right now?",
        "Olivia: Well, there are just... there are a lot of pressures. Just living at the spaulding house, and all eyes on you, and phillip's ghost roaming the hallways.",
        "Bill: Sounds like emma still needs me.",
        "Tony: You look great.",
        "Michelle: ( Laughs )",
        "Tony: Come on, will you?",
        "Michelle: In a minute. In a minute. Listen, I'm the bride, here. You've got to be nice to me.",
        "Tony: Oh, that's right. I forgot about that.",
        "Michelle: I don't have a white dress or a veil, so at least I can fix my hair and put lipstick on.",
        "Tony: Hm. Well, I happen to think that you're beautiful as you are. Hm?",
        "Michelle: Hey.",
        "Tony: Okay, all right. Why is that? What's going on?",
        "Michelle: I'm superstitious, you know? It's bad enough you're seeing the bride before the wedding, but kissing is bad luck, too.",
        "Tony: Rlly? Mice: Yes",
        "Tony: Well, you know, if i didn't know any better, I would say that you're stalling. You know that? What's going on? What? You don't want to marry me? You're having second thoughts? What? What's going on? Okay, look, it's a joke. I'm kidding. All right? It's a bad joke...",
        "Michelle: No, I know. I know, but I... I am having second thoughts. But not about marrying you, just about doing it here, like this, you know?",
        "Tony: But what you said a little while ago, that it was okay...",
        "Michelle: I know I said it was okay to do it here, but i also said I was having doubts. You know, it'S... it's just... it's really... this is so tacky, you know? And I want robbie to be there when we say our vows, don't you? And the rest of my family, and ray.",
        "Tony: Okay. Okay, listen, I promise you. Look, I promise you that when we get back home, we'll have another ceremony.",
        "Michelle: No. You know, tony...",
        "Tony: I promise you that. Okay? With everybody.",
        "Michelle: Listen. But we're cheating ourselves, here.",
        "Tony: No, we're not, babe. Let's just do this. We're not.",
        "Michelle: Why are you pushing this so much? See, you're rushing this. What is it? Why? Are you worried? What's going on?",
        "Tony: I'm not worried about anything. You love me. Okay? And I love you. And all I want to do is be with you, that's all. And honestly, I thought you felt the same way, but maybe this...",
        "Michelle: I do. I do.",
        "Tony: Okay, so?",
        "Michelle: I'm sorry, i just...",
        "Tony: What?",
        "Michelle: It's been a really intense 24 hours, that's all. And you know what? You're right. You're right. Let's just do it. Let's do it. As soon as the judge is ready, let's get married.",
        "Tony: You see? That's what I like to hear. Okay? I'm going to grab the judge.",
        "Danny: State of nevada divorce decree. My marriage to michelle is officially finito.",
        "Marina: This is what you wanted to tell me face to face.",
        "Danny: Yeah.",
        "Marina: That's it? There's nothing else you want to say?",
        "Danny: Well, yeah. Yeah, there is. Um, I know it's kind of late, but we did officially have a date scheduled for tonight, so you want to maybe go grab some dessert or a drink? Or...",
        "Marina: No. No, danny, I really need to know right now. I mean, are we just going to go out for dessert somewhere and get a piece of cake and then you're going to drop the bomb on me? Because if that's the case, I'd rather not do that. I'd just rather get it over with right now.",
        "Danny: Marina, what's going... what's the matter? What's wrong?",
        "Marina: I can't do this.",
        "Danny: What?",
        "Marina: I can'T.",
        "Danny: You can't do what?",
        "Marina: Do you know how i felt when you went off to vegas with michelle? Do you know how much that hurt me?",
        "Danny: Okay, yes. Yes, I think I do.",
        "Marina: No. No, you don't know. You couldn'T. You can'T. But that's my fault, because i haven't told you.",
        "Danny: Told me what? What?",
        "Marina: I'm in love with you.",
        "Frank: You knew harley would be in that prison before you took the job? Now, why would you do that? What, in the hopes of getting things started up with her again?",
        "Mallet: Listen to me. It's like I told gus. I took the job because it's a good job.",
        "Frank: Yeah, but you just said that...",
        "Mallet: Yeah, I want to help harley. Yes, frank, it's one of the perks of the job. Listen to me. I can keep an eye on her for you. I owe her something, frank. I owe all of you. Hey, by the way, I'm sorry about you and eleni. ( Cell phone ringing )",
        "Frank: Yeah. You stay put. Don't move an inch. Yeah, cooper.",
        "Mallet: Up at the pen you asked me if I would keep an eye on harley. You still want me to, now that you know who I am?",
        "Gus: I just want you to make sure she's safe.",
        "Mallet: Oh, I would, with or without your permission.",
        "Gus: Good. So you can take care of her on the inside, and I'll do my best to get her out.",
        "Mallet: So, if harley didn't kill phillip, who did?",
        "Gus: I'm working on several possibilities. Tell frank I'll see him around.",
        "Mallet: I don't think he'll care. I get the impression he doesn't like you much.",
        "Gus: Well, then there's two things we have in common.",
        "Harley: Are you threatening me, alan? Look around. I'm in prison. You won, okay? You've already taken everything from me.",
        "Alan: Not quite. Not by a long shot, harley.",
        "Harley: You're the one who belongs locked up. You're sick. You are just like phillip, blaming me for all your mistakes. Well, it's not my fault that gus is not some perfect spaulding clone, okay? He's his own man. Why can't you just be proud of him? Why can you not just love him for who he is?",
        "Alan: I'm not going to stand here and debate you about something that's none of your business. I came here to tell...",
        "Harley: What? What? To scare me?",
        "Alan: No, I didn't come here to scare you, but... are you scared, harley? Would you like to leave? Maybe... maybe you could call the guard. No, better yet, maybe I can call a guard for you. That's what I would do.",
        "Harley: ( Screams ) alan spaulding, you have taken everything from me. Well, I might take something from you. Coming up on \"guiding light\"...",
        "Olivia: What if I were in trouble? Very big trouble, and I needed you?",
        "Harley: Don't worry, I'll stop before you lose all of your air. oprah: Our former guest who's now in jail -- what happened? Next \"oprah.\"",
        "Harley: I guess this wasn't part of your little plan, was it, alan? Don't worry, I'll stop before you lose all of your air. I just want you to listen to me, just... are you listening?",
        "Alan: ( Choking )",
        "Harley: Are you listening? I am sick of your threats. I am sick of it. So here is one of my own. Phillip is already gone.",
        "Alan: ( Gasping )",
        "Harley: With one word to gus, I can make sure you lose everybody else, too, and you will die a very bitter, lonely old man.",
        "Alan: ( Gasping ) ( coughing )",
        "Harley: I'm ready to go back to my cell now, guard.",
        "Marina: Don'T... don't freak out on me, okay? I didn'T... I didn't say that to you just like I expected to hear you say the same thing. I just thought you should know where I stand.",
        "Danny: Oh, man, you're brave.",
        "Marina: Or stupid. Really stupid.",
        "Danny: Look, can we go somewhere else so we can talk? Just sit down and talk?",
        "Marina: Uh, no. Not tonight. I have to go back to the house and check on the boys. Zach has had a really hard time going to sleep, and he's been having nightmares.",
        "Danny: Well, I don't have any plans. What about later?",
        "Marina: No. I'M... I'll call you later, okay? I'll call you.",
        "Tony: We're on deck. Flowers. You need flowers.",
        "Michelle: No, no.",
        "Tony: No, no, no, no.",
        "Michelle: It's all right, i don't need flowers. It's okay, really.",
        "Tony: A bride needs a bouquet. That's for sure. You know what? Let's try this one right here. This is for you. Now, look, I'm sorry that they're plastic but I do promise you that every single day from here on out, I will bring you flowers to make up for plastic ones. One other thing. Hold on. What else can I finagle, here? Ah. This might bring back a little bit of memories. You remember this? Hm?",
        "Michelle: Yeah, you did that on the island.",
        "Tony: I did. I thought you were so beautiful. And when I look at you now, i fall in love with you more and more every day. I just want you to know that.",
        "Michelle: We're really good together, aren't we?",
        "Tony: Yeah, we are. We're the best. Look, I'm sorry that this whole ceremony, you know....",
        "Michelle: It's okay.",
        "Tony: ...It just seems so rushed, it's crazed and I'M... no, I'm sorry.",
        "Michelle: We're doing the right thing. I want this just as much s you do.",
        "Olivia: I'm sorry about the champagne. I didn't mean to...",
        "Bill: Yes, you did, and i probably deserved it. You said there's all this pressure. Is there anything I can do?",
        "Gus: Hey. Everything okay?",
        "Bill: Gus, would you mind your own business, please? We're trying to... ( cell phone ringing ) I have to take this.",
        "Olivia: Do you have to? Really?",
        "Bill: Yeah, I'll be right back.",
        "Gus: Don't worry. I'll take good care of her for you. You okay?",
        "Olivia: Yeah. We were just having a nice conversation.",
        "Gus: I see. I was going to get ready to get rid of him for you, you know?",
        "Olivia: Just out of the goodness of your heart.",
        "Gus: Yeah, well. We're like family, sort of. And I appreciate you coming to the plate for me back at the house.",
        "Olivia: Well, like you said, family.",
        "Gus: Mm-hmm. Well, the spaulding version of family.",
        "Olivia: I'm just... I'm glad that you and I are okay. I'm really happy to hear that you're just moving on past the murder investigation.",
        "Gus: Hm. Yeah. Right. All right. Well, if you don't need my services, I will be on my way.",
        "Olivia: Okay.",
        "Gus: Oh, and by the way, i went through your office. I had to get a bunch of files out so I could play catch-up. It's business. Is that all right?",
        "Olivia: Just business.",
        "Gus: Exactly, exactly. Why? There's no problem, is there?",
        "Olivia: No.",
        "Gus: You've got nothing to hide? ( Chuckles )",
        "Olivia: No.",
        "Gus: All right. See you around.",
        "Olivia: Bye.",
        "Mallet: Well, you seem like you're in a good mood.",
        "Harley: I just ran into an old friend. Why did you call me back here again?",
        "Mallet: Filing. More filing.",
        "Harley: Nothing that could wait until morning, huh?",
        "Mallet: Hey, if you want to go back to your cell, I can call the guard.",
        "Harley: No, no, no. Thank you. I wouldn't get any sleep tonight, anyway. So what needs to be done?",
        "Mallet: Oh, that box right there. So did you do anything interesting tonight, other than the usual tv and lockdown?",
        "Harley: No. No, nothing interesting. Although if I'd had access to a phone, like you have in your cabinet-- which I don't-- i would have made a call to my dad.",
        "Mallet: Hm. And if you could have reached your dad, what would you have said?",
        "Harley: Well, it wouldn't have been my dad who picked up the phone. It would have been my son, zach. And hearing his voice would have made me very, very happy.",
        "Mallet: I don't blame you. That's one cute kid.",
        "Harley: Oh, right. You saw his picture.",
        "Mallet: Uh, no. I went into town for a bite.",
        "Harley: You went to company?",
        "Mallet: I never actually ate, though. Yeah, buzz and frank weren't exactly thrilled to see me.",
        "Harley: You saw my father and frank?",
        "Mallet: Yeah, and your little boy. That zach, he looks like a great kid.",
        "Harley: You stay away from them. Do you hear me? You stay the hell away from my family.",
        "Mallet: It's no big deal. Buzz and frank were going to find out I was back sooner or later, so I made it sooner.",
        "Harley: I don't want you involved in my life, mallet.",
        "Mallet: That's a joke, right?",
        "Harley: No, I mean it.",
        "Mallet: Well, then you won't be too happy about this. I met your attorney, gus aitoro. Yeah, interesting guy. Not really who I'd pictured you with.",
        "Harley: No, no, no, no, no. I don't want you picturing me with anybody. Just stay away from me.",
        "Mallet: And I repeat, that's a joke, right? The hard truth here, harley, is that you're a con now. Your life isn't your own anymore. That's what prison does. That's the point of it. Okay? Now, I know you say that you're innocent...",
        "Harley: I am innocent.",
        "Mallet: Then that will only make this place worse. Do you know how few convictions get overturned on appeal? Huh? The odds are you're going to be here at least 15 years.",
        "Harley: Okay, okay. I know that.",
        "Mallet: Oh, you do? Well, you don't act like it. You act like you're holding on to hope. And as far as I've seen, this guy gus is only encouraging you. Which in my book makes him pretty selfish.",
        "Harley: And you'd know all about selfishness, wouldn't you?",
        "Mallet: All I'm saying is, harley...",
        "Harley: I know what you're saying, okay? I get it. I'm in it for the long haul and I'll be filing your files. I get it.",
        "Alan: Delco buyout?",
        "Gus: Uh, what's happening? How's it going?",
        "Alan: That's the delco...",
        "Gus: Oh, no. I'm just actually working on some projections of pharmaceuticals for our new bad girl hair line products. I was just checking out market researching.",
        "Alan: \"Ours.\" I like the sound of that. You want me to answer any questions that you might have about it?",
        "Gus: I'm kind of just getting my bearings, you know, and I'm just settling in. I'm actually kind of enjoying myself.",
        "Alan: Good, good. Well, other than burning the midnight oil at spaulding, are you involved in anything else? Got any other interests of any kind?",
        "Gus: Um, me? No. Not really. How about you? How are you doing?",
        "Alan: No, nothing... nothing's going on in my life. It's about as dull as you can get.",
        "Bill: I just met up with pierce out in the parking lot. Guess who's taking him to lunch tomorrow?",
        "Olivia: Good. I don't care. None of this means anything.",
        "Bill: Suddenly this victory is tasting a little less sweet.",
        "Olivia: What are we doing? What are we doing? What is this? I know we're married, but what...",
        "Bill: Well, this battling seemed a little like foreplay to me.",
        "Olivia: Then what? I mean, if I... what if I were in trouble? Very big trouble, and I needed you?",
        "Bill: Do you?",
        "Olivia: You should just go celebrate your win. Really. Go tell your uncle josh and your daddy, billy.",
        "Tony: You look beautiful.",
        "Judge: Okay, shall we begin?",
        "Michelle: I'm ready. Let's do it.",
        "Danny: Marina?",
        "Marina: I didn't have to help grandpa with the kids. I just needed to think, danny, so I went for a walk and I ended up here. And I climbed up through the fire escape and came in through the window. Not too gracefully, you know? A guy like you should really get better security here.",
        "Danny: Did you get hurt?",
        "Marina: No. No, I'm okay, but what hurts is making a fool out of myself.",
        "Marina: I'm really sorry about before, danny. It was so lame of me to throw the \"l\" word at you, like, five seconds after you got divorced. I guess it was just building up in me, you know? And it definitely came out at the wrong time. But the fact is it's true.",
        "Danny: Marina...",
        "Marina: ...And I just need to get through this. I meant what I said before. I do love you. You are... you're such a great guy, a great man, and you've always been absolutely honest with me, so don't go changing that now, okay, just because you're afraid to hurt me, because I'll live.",
        "Danny: Marina...",
        "Marina: I will. I'll be okay. Just don't say something because you think it's what I want to hear, because it's not. What I need from you now, is the truth.",
        "Danny: Will you shut up? Please? Because this is killing me, you going on and on and on like this. There's something that you need to know.",
        "Judge: To choose to spend your life with another person...",
        "Danny: You are an amazing, beautiful woman, but you're wrong. I have not been totally honest with you.",
        "Marina: Danny, I already know. You still love michelle.",
        "Tony: Michelle, I never in my life thought that I could find someone who would love me, and i guess that's why I continue to fight for you. You're everything to me.",
        "Danny: I do still love michelle. A part of me will always love michelle. Look, what I'm trying to say is... I held back before because I really wanted to be sure about how I felt. And now I'm sure.",
        "Tony: Michelle, I want you to know that I love you with all of my heart, and all I want to do is spend the rest of my life making you happy.",
        "Danny: Is that okay with you?",
        "Judge: Michelle, you can go ahead and say your vows now.",
        "Michelle: Tony, I... I just can't do this. I'm so sorry.",
        "Tony: Yes, yes. Yes, you can.",
        "Michelle: Tony...",
        "Tony: Yes, you can. Hey, I know you want to be with me. You're just scared. It's okay.",
        "Michelle: Tony?",
        "Judge: I'll just give you folks a moment.",
        "Michelle: Look, you think that I'm confused right now, i know you do, but you know what? I'm not. I'm as clear as I've been in a really long time, and listen to me. I do love you. I do. But I love danny, too. I'm so sorry, tony. I'm so sorry.",
        "Harley: How am I going to do this? 15 years of this? 15 years of feeling the sun and the wind on my face, for what, one hour a day? How am I going to do this?",
        "Mallet: Come here. Enjoy it. You know, this is kind of a one- shot deal, you know? I can't show preferential...",
        "Harley: I know. It's okay. It's perfect right now. Thank you. What's that smell? Do you know what that is?",
        "Mallet: I don't know. It smells like, I don't know, flowers?",
        "Harley: Yeah. It's like jasmine.",
        "Mallet: Jasmine. I wouldn't know.",
        "Harley: Hm. It's just so familiar to me. Where do I know that from?",
        "Mallet: Harley? Are you all right?",
        "Harley: I remember something. From the night of the murder, something that I didn't remember before.",
        "Alan: You know, gus, I would like to find something at spaulding that you felt passionate about, some area that you could really throw yourself into. Perhaps maybe back in the legal department. I think it would help you put harley behind you.",
        "Gus: Dad, look at me. It is behind me, okay? I've got to run. I've got to go to the house. Can you do me a favor? Can you pay this for me?",
        "Alan: Sure.",
        "Gus: Dad.",
        "Alan: Oh, gus? Never mind.",
        "Gus: Right. Buzz? It's gus. Listen, I don't even really know why I'm calling you, but I kind of feel like you've been my partner on this stuff up to now. I just wanted you to know I got a second message saying that whoever is responsible for killing phillip is still in the spaulding house, so... whatever. I'll be in touch. Next, on \"guiding light\"...",
        "Dinah: You are jealous that I'm carrying edmund's baby and you can'T.",
        "Jeffrey: What are you doing in a place like this, all alone?",
        "Vanessa: Oh, I'm fortifying myself for a mission. My daughter's life could depend on it."
