    "Recap": [
        "Maya waits at the Sky Lounge for Rick. He tells her that his lawyer should be there shortly. His dad will sign the papers and he has a year to prove himself. He says he will text her as soon as it is done. She is so excited. Ridge tells Caroline that he doesn't know why but Rick is up to something. He still is not touching Caroline and yet he is trying to convince his dad they are back together and will be a team to lead FC into the future. Caroline says if it makes Rick more confident and secure then she thinks Eric should give it to him. Before Carter comes in to see Eric, Eric wishes Gordon a good retirement and thanks him for making them look so good for so many years. Carter wants to make sure Eric is happy with his decision. Eric says it is only for one year. Carter says he knows and if all goes well, fine but if not, then a year is a very long time. He's giving Rick all the power and no one will be able to contradict him, not even Eric. Eric says he is leaving town with his brother so he needs to act on this now. Rick walks in with his attorney and wants to get started right away. Rick pretends he does not understand. Is there something his dad needs to hear from him first. Eric says no. Rick says good. He is already CEO so this just gives him more confidence that Ridge won't interfere while his dad is away. If Ridge interferes the company could become a gridlock. He just needs to know he has his dad's full support and trust. Eric says he does. He and Caroline are the future of this company and if he ever doubted that he doesn't anymore. While still in the room Carter texts Ridge who in turn tells Caroline that Rick is making his move now. He and Caroline head straight for Eric's office where Pam tries to block the door saying they are in a meeting. Othello shows up per Maya's request and asks what is going on. She says it is finally happening. Rick and his attorney are down with Eric right now. Rick can not play Caroline's happy husband forever so their plan has to work. Eric takes the pen Rick is holding and signs the papers. Ridge busts in but Rick tells him it is too late. The papers have been signed. Maya tells Othello that he knows her. She is not a liar and neither is Rick so she does not like to hide like this even for one more day. This is their future. They had to delay it a little bit but today it could happen. She says she has to go but she will text him. After today they can come out as Mr. and Mrs. Rick Forrester Jr. CEO of FC. Ivy catches Pam doing her best to eavesdrop at the door and joins in. All Pam can tell her is there is a meeting with Eric, Rick and his attorney and Caroline and Ridge just barged in. About all they can hear is that Ridge is not very happy and is arguing with Rick. Pam thinks Ivy seems to know more than she is saying. Ivy says she is trying hard not to think about it at all. Rick asks his lawyer if all seems to be in order and the attorney says yes. Eric tells Ridge there is no need to get upset with this as he has signed the papers and all are in order. Caroline thanks Eric. He tells Ridge that he had plenty of time to think about this and he is satisfied with this decision. Ridge argues that he just gave him carte blanche even if it just for a year. Caroline says Rick is not going to do anything to hurt the company. Eric says Caroline and Rick are back together and are going to lead this company into the future and he suggests that Ridge accept that and do the same. Ridge still argues that Rick is already CEO so why is he pushing for this now. Ivy looks for Maya but finds Othello. She says Caroline is her friend and if something is going to happen today in that meeting he needs to tell her so she can warn Caroline. She needs to go into that meeting and end it. Maya shows up and attempts to go into Rick's office. Pam stops her and says she will buzz her when they are done. Maya chooses to just wait in a nearby chair. Pam tells her nicely that if Maya wasn't invited then this does not concern her. Maya says okay, Pam can just do what she needs to do and Maya won't bother her. But she is not going anywhere. Ridge still argues that something is not right. Eric says Rick has proven himself to him. Caroline adds everyone is getting along and working together now. He's had some problems in the past but he's handled this with a great deal of maturity. Ridge says Rick had a tantrum and that is maturity? Eric says this is over. It's signed, sealed and delivered. Ridge tells his dad it's not just the papers. He can't put his finger on it, but something is not right.",
        "Rick texts Maya and tells her to be ready to come in. Caroline tries to argue that Rick is doing a good job and it will be a team effort. Eric agrees, FC has never been about one person leading it, it's always been a team effort. Rick stands up and says and that won't change. He says FC has always been about strong couples beginning with Eric and Stephanie and he intends to keep that tradition. If he has learned anything lately is that he needs a strong partner. He pushes the button for Maya to come in. He continues that he could not have done this without her. Someone he trusts and is completely loyal to him. Caroline thanks him for saying that and says she is so proud to be his partner. Maya comes in and Caroline, Eric and Ridge try to excuse her as they are in a meeting. Rick says she can stay. He would like her to hear this. He explains that his dad signed the papers and he will be leading FC forward as CEO for one year but not alone. He's going to need a partner a person who is loyal to him and be there for him through it all, helping him celebrate every success and overcome every challenge. Caroline beams. She says as his wife and his partner he can count on her. He drops the bomb. He was not referring to her but Maya. She is stunned. He says the cat is out of the bag. He and Maya are still together. His marriage to Caroline is over. It was the day she betrayed him with Ridge. He walks past her to stand behind Maya and says Maya is the one he will be sharing his life with and they will be running the company. Caroline is stunned and everyone else's chins almost hit the floor."

        "Maya: [Sighs] Hi. How'd it go?",
        "Rick: My attorney just called. He should be here any minute.",
        "Maya: So this is it?",
        "Rick: Yeah, I can't wait any longer. My dad needs to sign those papers today.",
        "Maya: He owes this to you, Rick.",
        "Rick: Well, it's not everything that I asked for, but it's enough. It's a year. I mean, it's a year for me to prove myself as C.E.O.",
        "Maya: It's a year with a woman who supports you. And you can finally end this charade with Caroline. I-I am so excited.",
        "Rick: I tell you what. I'll text you as soon as I'm done.",
        "Maya: Okay. Good luck.",
        "Rick: Thanks.",
        "Maya: [Sighs]",
        "Ridge: I know Rick is up to something.",
        "Caroline: Look, Ridge, I appreciate it --",
        "Ridge: He says everything's fine between you two, and you tell me it isn't.",
        "Caroline: Well, it will be. He just needs a little more time.",
        "Ridge: He's asking a lot of you and of my father.",
        "Caroline: That's what this is about -- the papers that he gave Eric?",
        "Ridge: Yeah. If he's so secure in your relationship and -- and his job here, why does he need a piece of paper saying he can control the company? Why?",
        "Caroline: Well, if it makes him feel more confident and more secure, then I think Eric should give it to him.",
        "Eric: I got to tell you, you're gonna be missed around here. Your dedication, the way you never dropped focus.",
        "Gordon: You always call the shots, Eric.",
        "Eric: Well, you made us all look really good around here for a long time. Enjoy your retirement, Gordon. I don't know how we're gonna do it without you.",
        "Gordon: The pleasure was all mine.",
        "Eric: All right. Take care.",
        "Gordon: Take care.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Carter: Are you sure you want to do this?",
        "Eric: It's only for a year, Carter.",
        "Carter: [Scoffs] It's a decision that can't be changed. Now, if things are going well, that's not a problem. But if they don't, a year is a very long time.",
        "Eric: I'm leaving town with my brother. If I'm gonna act on this, then I need to act on it now.",
        "Carter: Eric, you're giving Rick all the power. No one will be able to contradict him, not even you.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Rick: Good morning! Carter, you know my attorney.",
        "Carter: I do. Kris.",
        "Kris: Carter.",
        "Rick: I assume Dad had you look over the agreement?",
        "Carter: Yeah.",
        "Rick: Then let's get started right away, shall we?",
        "Carter: As long as you're not expecting Eric to give you an immediate answer.",
        "Rick: Is there something I haven't said? Something that you need to hear from me?",
        "Eric: No.",
        "Kris: The agreement is very straightforward.",
        "Carter: As counsel to Forrester Creations, I have to caution you both about the long-term impact of this proposal.",
        "Rick: Dad, you already made me C.E.O. This piece of paper simply gives me the security to do my job effectively. And as you know, Forrester can't have a leader who's constantly looking over his shoulder. I need to be focused. And I don't want any interference by Ridge while my dad is away.",
        "[Cell phone chimes]",
        "Ridge: It's Carter. Rick is making his move.",
        "Othello: Hey.",
        "Maya: Hey. You got here fast.",
        "Othello: Are you kidding me? First-class invite to hang out in a building full of models? [Scoffs] What's going on?",
        "Maya: It's finally happening, Othello. Rick and his attorney are downstairs with Eric right now.",
        "Othello: Well, that's a good thing, isn't it?",
        "Maya: If our plan works. Rick can't play Caroline's happy husband forever. He has to pull this off and get Eric to sign those papers before somebody catches on.",
        "Eric: I understand your concern about Ridge.",
        "Rick: Dad, I'm worried about the company. If Ridge has the authority to undermine my every decision, Forrester could become gridlocked.",
        "Eric: Ridge doesn't want that any more than you do.",
        "Rick: So, what happens if I make a decision that he doesn't like and you're not here to remind him who's in charge? Dad, I have a vision for Forrester. I just want the chance to implement it unimpeded. C.E.O. For a year. Give me the opportunity to make my own plans and see them through. You made Ridge C.E.O. For a couple days. You changed your mind. You took it away. I need to make sure that I have your full support and complete trust.",
        "Eric: You do. You and Caroline are the future of this company. If I ever doubted that, I-I don't anymore. Here.",
        "Pam: Oh, no, sorry. You can't go in there. Rick's in a meeting with his attorney. No, Ridge. I-I --",
        "Ridge: Hey, dad. I need to talk to you. I know about the papers you've drawn up.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Rick: It's too late, Ridge. It's already been signed.",
        "Othello: Hey. Anything?",
        "Maya: No. Not yet.",
        "Othello: [Sighs] It really doesn't bother you the way Rick's playing Caroline like this?",
        "Maya: Do I think he could do that to me?",
        "Othello: Hey, so do you think Eric will sign the papers?",
        "Maya: Rick does.",
        "Othello: So then why are you nervous?",
        "Maya: Because I'm not a liar, and neither is Rick. And I can't stand the thought of keeping this up for even another day. I-I don't hide who I am or what I want. You know me. I keep it real, and so does Rick. This is our future. And we've had to delay it a little bit, but -- but today it could finally happen.",
        "[Cell phone chimes]",
        "Maya: Okay, I have to go. But don't worry, okay? Rick's gonna call me. And when he does, we can come out as the future Mr. and Mrs. Eric Forrester Jr., C.E.O. of Forrester Creations. [Chuckles]",
        "Pam: Thank you, martin. If you could take that down to shipping, that'd be great.",
        "[Indistinct arguing]",
        "Ivy: What's going on?",
        "Pam: [Gasps] Shh! That's what I'm trying to find out.",
        "Ivy: Who's in there?",
        "Pam: Well, Rick, Eric, Rick's lawyer and Carter, Ridge, and Caroline.",
        "Ivy: How long have they been in there for?",
        "Pam: Well, Rick and his attorney have been in there for a long time, but Ridge and Caroline just barged in. I told them that they should wait, but they just pushed right past me.",
        "[Arguing continues]",
        "Ivy: [Sighs] What's happening now?",
        "Pam: A lot of arguing.",
        "Ivy: Arguing between who? Caroline and Rick?",
        "Pam: No. Ridge, mostly. He doesn't seem very happy with Rick.",
        "Ivy: Okay, so what -- what are they fighting about? Is it work, or is it something else?",
        "Pam: I can't really make it out. But why? What are you thinking?",
        "Ivy: To be honest, Pam, I am trying not to think about it at all.",
        "Pam: Okay.",
        "Ridge: It's ridiculous. What Rick wants is unprecedented.",
        "Rick: Is everything in order?",
        "Kris: Yes.",
        "Ridge: Hey. That thing's not leaving the building.",
        "Eric: Ridge, there's no reason to argue about this. It's over. I signed.",
        "Caroline: Thank you, Eric. Your support means so much to Rick.",
        "Ridge: You don't know what you've done.",
        "Eric: Look, I've had plenty of time to think about this. I am happy with my decision.",
        "Ridge: You're satisfied giving full control to Rick?",
        "Eric: Yes! And that's what I've done. He's gonna run this company for a year. While I'm gone, he's got the security he needs to do it.",
        "Ridge: Security? You just gave him carte blanche!",
        "Caroline: Rick is not gonna do anything to hurt this company.",
        "Ridge: You sure about that?",
        "Eric: Rick and Caroline are back together. As a couple, I trust them to take this company into the future. I suggest you do the same.",
        "Ridge: Okay. And what if he makes a mistake? Huh? He's made some terrible choices in the past. He's made you make a bad choice right now!",
        "Rick: This is a waste of time. We're done.",
        "Ridge: No, wait. Stop. You got to explain something to me. You're already C.E.O. of this company. Why do you need this paper so badly? Why are you pushing for it? What else is going on here?",
        "Othello: Excuse me.",
        "Pam: Okay.",
        "Ivy: Hey. Uh, have you seen Maya?",
        "Othello: Yeah, you just missed her.",
        "Ivy: Well, where was she going?",
        "Othello: I think she had to get back to work.",
        "Ivy: Okay. And she seemed normal? She wasn't worked up about anything, maybe something to do with Rick? Othello, I think something is going on between those two. You're friends with them, so I'm just wondering, do you know anything?",
        "Othello: Look, those two, it's complicated.",
        "Ivy: Yeah. Well, especially now that Rick and Caroline are back together. Othello, if you know something... you do.",
        "Othello: I'm not sure what you mean.",
        "Ivy: You know what? I-I can't do this anymore. I saw Rick leaving Maya's apartment. I saw them kissing. I told Maya this has to end. Has it? Well, Caroline is a friend of mine. I know how much Rick means to her. If those two are planning something....if something bad is gonna happen today, then you need to tell me. If Rick and Maya are planning something that could hurt my friend, then I need to to go in there right now and end it.",
        "Pam: Oh, um, Rick's in a meeting. I can buzz you when he's free.",
        "Maya: They've been in there a while.",
        "Pam: Yeah, and they're probably gonna be in there a while long, so if you want to just go run downstairs, I'll-- I'll call you, when they're done.",
        "Maya: I'll wait.",
        "Pam: You know, maybe someone else could help you...? Except [laughs] there's not really anybody around here to do that. Brooke and Hope are in Europe, and everybody else is in that meeting.",
        "Maya: Ridge and Caroline are-- they're in there with Rick?",
        "Pam: Maya, if you weren't invited to the meeting, it doesn't concern you.",
        "Maya: You do what you need to do, Pam. I won't bother you, but I'm not going anywhere.",
        "Ridge: Something doesn't feel right.",
        "Caroline: Ridge, it's fine. Everything has been going really well at the office. We're all getting along. We're all working together.",
        "Eric: Rick has proven himself to me. He got off track there for awhile, but that's behind him. He's handled a very difficult situation with a great deal of maturity.",
        "Ridge: With -- with what? With maturity? He had a tantrum. He wanted full control. What's mature about that?",
        "Eric: He asked me for unconditional support. That's what I gave him.",
        "Ridge: And I think that's great. But why does he need it in writing? What is it, huh? Your trust issues -- you got to work on that on your own, not here, not now.",
        "Rick: This is the exact reason for it, dad.",
        "Eric: Ridge, this is over. It's signed, sealed, and delivered. What's the matter with you?",
        "Ridge: It's -- it's not just the paper, dad. Something's going on here. I can't put my finger on it, but something isn't right.",
        "[Cell phone chimes]",
        "Caroline: Rick has earned his chance, okay? He is okay with us working together. He's making the right decisions for the company.",
        "Ridge: And now he can make any decision he wants, and nobody can tell him what to do.",
        "Rick: I'm not gonna be running the company alone.",
        "Eric: Forrester is a team effort. It always has been.",
        "Rick: And that's not about to change. No one has ever run Forrester alone. Forrester's always had a history of strong couples, beginning with dad and Stephanie. And I intend to keep that family tradition, because if there's anything that I've learned over the last few weeks, it's the value of a great partner.",
        "[Cell phone chimes]",
        "Rick: I couldn't have done it without her. Someone I trust, who's completely loyal to me.",
        "Caroline: Thank you, Rick. And I am so proud to be your partner.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Carter: Maya?",
        "Caroline: You can't just barge in here. We're having a meeting.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Maya: You wanted to see me, Rick? O of quiet in here.",
        "Pam: [Chuckles] Not in there.",
        "Othello: Is something going on?",
        "Pam: Yeah. A meeting. A big one.",
        "Othello: Do you know what about? Co-- Pam. Come on. You know everything that happensteter.",
        "Pam: Well, not that I was eavesdropping or anything, but I did hear Rick ask Eric to sign these papers, and Ridge is really not happy about it.",
        "Othello: Ridge is in there with Eric and Rick?",
        "Pam: Half the company's in there. Even Maya. Don't ask me why. She was hovering around my desk, and then she gets this text from Rick. And now she's in the meeting.",
        "Othello: Interesting.",
        "Pam: You don't seem surprised.",
        "Othello: I don't work here, Pam. I don't know who's usually in these meetings.",
        "Pam: What are you doing here, Othello?",
        "Othello: [Chuckles] Excuse me?",
        "Pam: No, no, no. Why did you come by? Did Rick ask you to stop by?",
        "Othello: I was in the neighborhood. I'm deejaying tonight.",
        "Pam: Oh, yeah, no. You know something.",
        "Othello: Sounds like a busy day. I could just come back.",
        "Pam: Oh, come on, Othello. I told you what I knew.",
        "Othello: Okay. Listen, all I can tell you is there could be some big changes coming up. And I'm kind of looking forward to them.",
        "Eric: Maya, whatever it was that Rick wanted to see you about, I'm sure it can wait.",
        "Maya: I got your text.",
        "Carter: This isn't the time.",
        "Ridge: Carter's right. You need to go. Come on. Out.",
        "Rick: No. I'd like Maya to hear this.",
        "Caroline: I do, too. You know, I was just telling Rick how proud and grateful I was for all of his kind words.",
        "Maya: What did he say?",
        "Rick: My dad just signed papers giving me irrevocable control as C.E.O. for a year.",
        "Maya: Wow. That's... that's a big deal. Congratulations.",
        "Rick: Thank you. I was just telling everybody how excited I am to get started, but even more determined to do a great job as C.E.O., to lead this team. We all have to work together. Me, Ridge, Caroline, you. Especially while dad is away.",
        "Maya: Anything you need me to do.",
        "Rick: That's what I'm about now -- moving forward. But as I was saying, I'm not gonna be doing it alone. I'm gonna need a partner, a person who is -- is gonna be there for me through it all. Help me celebrate every success, help me overcome every challenge.",
        "Caroline: And I look forward to it. As your wife and as your partner, you...you can depend on me.",
        "Rick: I wasn't talking about you, Caroline. I was referring to Maya.",
        "Caroline: What?",
        "Rick: Well, I guess the cat's out of the bag. Maya and I are still together.",
        "Caroline: No. We're married.",
        "Rick: Our marriage is over. It ended the day you betrayed me with Ridge. You see, Caroline, you're not the woman I'll be sharing the company and my life with. Maya is.",
