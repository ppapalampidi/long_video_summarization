He tells Hope that people can change; he has. He loves Quinn and he is sorry that Hope disapproves and hopes someday she will. He says they can discuss this further but not today .he loves her. Hope hangs up and Quinn charges Brooke for being so desperate that she doesn't even care that she has hurt both Deacon and his daughter. Brooke confronts Deacon and says he is hurting her daughter. Wyatt tells them it is time for this to break up. Brooke leaves and says she can not do this. Bill tells Katie unless the wicked witch of the West comes after him or his family he does not want to know any details of the wedding. He just knows something is going on at FC and it involves Rick. Maya's little sister indicated that something big could bring down FC and Rick and they need to find that something. Bill says he is extremely impressed with Liam. He is beginning to show flashes of his old man. Maya catches Liam listening at the door who pretends he came to ask about Nicole being the new model. Liam tells Nicole that Wyatt said she had a lot of potential.",
        "Quinn tells Carter to start again and take all the time he needs. She only plans to marry once and make it last. Wyatt said the interruption got him to thinking and he needs to say something. Maya tells Nicole that Wyatt is a salesman and he is very good at it. Nicole wonders if Maya thinks that Wyatt is not genuine in his interest in her. Liam tells Maya, who is praising Rick, that it is good to be King, no one can knock you off your throne. Wyatt tells them that marriage is a leap of faith and he wants them to stick together. He knows Deacon will as he stood by his mom when no one else would. It's how much love is in the room. His mom raised him alone and devoted most of her time to his happiness and he is very grateful. He wants her to experience all that happiness that she gave him and more. They hug. Brooke tells Katie that she tried but even with Hope's Skype it did not help. Deacon is still determined to marry Quinn and spouts how she has changed. She hopes he is not picking Quinn over his own daughter, but nothing she has done has made a difference. Bill says it is like he said all along, those two losers deserve each other. Carter starts the ceremony again. Standing before each other holding both of their hands together, they exchange their vows and make promises to each other.

She says nothing is impossible since the day she met him. His turn - Deacon says pretty much everybody is against this, but he promises to prove them wrong. They have fought against the odds and they better watch out. They are gonna prove they can make each other happy. Carter hands them the rings and says it is a token of their love and faith to each other . He pronounces them husband and wife Then he reaches into his pocket and brings out a surprise from Quinn.

        "Quinn: You really are the most selfish woman in the world and so predictable.",
        "Brooke: Deacon will listen to his daughter.",
        "Quinn: Hope has had plenty of time to object to our engagement, but she wants to discuss it now, in the middle of our wedding?",
        "Brooke: The wedding is over.",
        "Deacon: Honey, I hear what you're saying, but what you're asking, it's --",
        "Hope: It's not too late. You don't have to go through with this. Why would you want to marry someone like Quinn, after everything she's put you through?",
        "Deacon: Hope, she's trying to make all that better.",
        "Hope: She can't. Quinn will never be a part of my life, and -- and, dad... I'm sorry, but if you marry her... neither will you.",
        "Katie: Quinn says she's changed.",
        "Bill: Yeah? Well, Quinn's as delusional as ever, inviting us to her wedding.",
        "Katie: I agree, but you are Wyatt's father.",
        "Bill: Uh-huh, and Wyatt's a big boy. He doesn't need daddy to hold his hand at the ceremony.",
        "Katie: If there is a ceremony.",
        "Bill: Quinn finally finds some sucker dumb enough to marry her? She's not gonna let him go.",
        "Katie: Well, she may not have a choice. Brooke was here earlier, and she says she's determined to stop that wedding.",
        "Maya: We have to be responsible about this.",
        "Nicole: You can't keep it a secret forever.",
        "Maya: No, but if it comes out the wrong way, it's not just gonna affect Rick. It could impact Forrester and everyone who works here. We shouldn't even be talking about this here. Can you imagine if someone heard? Liam!",
        "Liam: Hi.",
        "Maya: I'm sorry. I didn't hear you knock.",
        "Liam: Uh, yeah. Sorry about that. Am I -- am I interrupting?",
        "Maya: No. We're just chatting. Did you need something?",
        "Liam: No. Just came by to see if the rumors were true.",
        "Maya: What rumors?",
        "Liam: Well, apparently, you may not be the only Avant on the Forrester runway this season. Hi. I'm Liam Spencer.",
        "Nicole: Nicole.",
        "Liam: Hi.",
        "Nicole: Spencer.",
        "Liam: Yeah.",
        "Nicole: You're Wyatt's brother.",
        "Liam: I am. I am. In fact, I think that's my official title. I'm also the editor of eye on fashion.",
        "Maya: And president of Spencer publications and Ivy's boyfriend.",
        "Liam: Yes, which means that we'll probably be seeing a lot of each other.",
        "Bill: I know that Deacon was sniffing around broke a while back, but I didn't think that Brooke had any interest in Deacon.",
        "Katie: I don't think she does.",
        "Bill: But she's gonna stop the wedding?",
        "Katie: She thinks that Deacon is making a horrible mistake.",
        "Bill: Well, Deacon and Quinn have been engaged for a while. Brooke had plenty of time to talk him out of it.",
        "Katie: He wouldn't listen.",
        "Bill: So, why does she think he's gonna listen now?",
        "Katie: [Sighs] I don't really know, but I got the feeling that she was gonna keep trying until he did.",
        "Bill: [Chuckles] Yeah? Well, Quinn the crazy might have something to say about that.",
        "Quinn: This is ridiculous. Hope should be talking to you, not Deacon.",
        "Wyatt: Mom, it's okay.",
        "Quinn: No, it's not. They're gonna ruin my wedding. Let me talk to her.",
        "Deacon: No.",
        "Quinn: Hope, I know you have reservations about --",
        "Deacon: Quinn, stop, please. Hope, I don't want to disappoint you, and I don't want to damage our relationship. Honey, I hear you. I know that this upsets you, and I know how you feel about Quinn. But I love her. I mean, you weren't there to see it, but she's not the same person that she was when you left. People can change. I know that because I've changed. I've changed for the better because of Quinn. And I am gonna marry her. I'm sorry you're not ready to accept that. I just hope that one day you will be.",
        "Hope: No, dad. I won't.",
        "Deacon: Well, obviously, we've got to discuss this further, but we're not gonna do it today. I love you, hope. I just wish you'd share this with me.",
        "[Tablet beeps]",
        "Brooke: What happened?",
        "Deacon: She hung up on me.",
        "Quinn: Are you happy now? You are so desperate to hurt me, you don't care what you do to Deacon and his daughter. choose Quinn over your own child.",
        "Brooke: You're going to choose Quinn over your own child?",
        "Deacon: No, Brooke. I'm marrying the woman I love.",
        "Brooke: I told hope you wouldn't do this to her, you wouldn't hurt her like this.",
        "Quinn: If she's hurting, Brooke, it's because you of you. You used her.",
        "Wyatt: Okay. Everyone just take a breath.",
        "Carter: Deacon, if you need time to think --",
        "Deacon: No. No. Carter, let's keep going.",
        "Brooke: Deacon, no.",
        "Deacon: Brooke, I get why you're doing this, okay? You care. I understand. But my mind is made up.",
        "Brooke: Well, that makes me very sad.",
        "Deacon: I guess you won't be staying.",
        "Brooke: I can't watch you do this.",
        "Quinn: Thank you.",
        "Deacon: Carter, let's do this.",
        "Bill: Heard anything from Brooke?",
        "Katie: No. Has Wyatt called you?",
        "Bill: Hell, no! He knows better than that. Unless the wicked witch is coming after me or my family, I don't want to know anything about what's going on in crazyland.",
        "Katie: I'm sure he's not very happy with Brooke right now. I mean, she's been supporting Rick. I would like to think that he could understand that she's just trying to protect her child.",
        "Bill: Well, Brooke may end up regretting that.",
        "Katie: Why? Ohh, right -- because of the \"secret.\"",
        "Bill: Yeah. You know... there's something going on at Forrester. It involves Rick, and nobody knows what it is.",
        "Katie: Or it's nothing because Wyatt only overheard one conversation.",
        "Bill: No. Maya's little sister indicated that it's something big -- something that can bring down Maya and Rick and everything they've worked for. And my boys -- my boys are gonna make that happen.",
        "Katie: You must be so proud.",
        "Bill: I am.",
        "Katie: Mm.",
        "Bill: Especially of Liam. He's starting to show some flashes of the old man.",
        "Liam: Wow. Wyatt told me you were already doing some modeling.",
        "Nicole: I'm just getting started.",
        "Liam: Yeah, well, you must be doing something right, 'cause Wyatt told me to keep an eye on you.",
        "Maya: Wyatt said that -- not Ivy?",
        "Liam: No, Ivy mentioned it, too. I just figured since Wyatt's kind of a big wig around here, I thought it'd have more weight coming from him.",
        "Nicole: So, he thought I was okay?",
        "Liam: More than okay. I believe his exact words were \"lots of potential.\"",
        "Maya: Well, of course that's what he said. Wyatt's a smart guy.",
        "Nicole: Well, he seemed nice.",
        "Liam: He is nice. Thank you for saying that. You know, Spencers get a bad rap, but we're nice people. And Wyatt -- he's a good dude.",
        "Wyatt: Ready to do this?",
        "Quinn: Um... no more distractions?",
        "Deacon: You know, we could have just eloped. I mean, we could have just run off, just the two of us.",
        "Quinn: I wanted a real wedding.",
        "Deacon: Okay, baby. What you want, you get.",
        "Quinn: Carter, please take your time with this. I'm only getting married once, and I would like it to last.",
        "Carter: Where were we?",
        "Wyatt: \"Speak now or forever hold your peace.\"",
        "Carter: Right. Anyone else have anything to add?",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles]",
        "Carter: Okay. Moving on.",
        "Wyatt: Actually, um... uh, Brooke's interruption got me thinking. I-I got to say something.",
        "Maya: Wyatt is a salesman. He is great at flattery.",
        "Nicole: You don't think what he said is true?",
        "Maya: No, I do. I do. It's just no one becomes a model overnight. You're just getting started. You have a lot to learn.",
        "Liam: But, you know, hey, lucky for you, you have your big sister to show you the ropes.",
        "Maya: Yeah, but fashion's a tough business, and who you know only gets you so far. Just ask Liam's girlfriend. Even being a Forrester doesn't guarantee you success.",
        "Liam: [Chuckles] Y-- well, uh, being a Spencer doesn't help much, either. Just ask Caroline.",
        "Maya: Liam doesn't approve of the way that Rick has treated Ivy and Caroline.",
        "Liam: Oh, well, no. I-I would add Aly to that list, as well.",
        "Maya: He thinks Rick's being too hard on them.",
        "Nicole: Well, is he?",
        "Maya: Rick holds people to the same standard that he does himself. I mean, Forrester is more successful than ever because of his leadership but also his commitment to excellence, and he's not gonna change that just because it rubs some people the wrong way.",
        "Liam: Yeah. No. No. Why would he? I mean, he has irrevocable control. Nobody can tell him what to do. Nobody can complain. I mean, who would they complain to, right? As far as Eric's concerned, Rick is doing a bang-up job.",
        "Maya: He is doing a bang-up job -- great, I'd say.",
        "Liam: Sure. Yeah. No, no. Sure. Sure. Sure. Just don't ask any of his employees how they feel about working for him, not that they'd be honest if he did. I mean, nobody wants to tick off the boss. Oh, it's good to be king, isn't it? Nobody can knock you off your throne.",
        "Katie: Projections look pretty good. [Laughing] Stop that. Oh, hi. Um, did you stop the wedding?",
        "Brooke: No.",
        "Bill: You didn't get there in time?",
        "Brooke: Deacon wouldn't listen. And if hope couldn't get through to him, nobody can.",
        "Wyatt: I wasn't gonna say anything 'cause this is your day, but... seeing Brooke and hearing hope's voice -- I just -- I had to say something. Marriage is a leap of faith. Starting a new life with someone -- that's exciting. And I just -- I ask you guys to hold on to that feeling. And I warn you about the tough times. I just want to tell you to stick it out and stand by each other.",
        "Deacon: You don't have to.",
        "Wyatt: No, I don't. I know you're gonna stick by my mom because you already have. You did it when everybody else turned away, and that's including me. And you just did it again. I just wish more people could have seen it, but...",
        "Deacon: [Chuckles]",
        "Wyatt: I think it's only fitting. Growing up, mom always told me that it's not about the size of your family that matters. It's about how much love is in the room. And I think that goes for weddings, too.",
        "Quinn: I do, too.",
        "Wyatt: Mom, you -- you raised me all alone, and you devoted yourself to my happiness -- sometimes a little too much. But, uh, I am very grateful for that. And I want you to experience all the happiness -- as much as you gave me, if not more.",
        "Brooke: I tried.",
        "Katie: You called hope?",
        "Brooke: I was positive Deacon would listen to her.",
        "Katie: What did she say?",
        "Brooke: She just told him that there's no way she would accept Quinn as his wife.",
        "Bill: She gave him an ultimatum?",
        "Brooke: Deacon doesn't see it that way.",
        "Katie: Well, no, of course not. If he did, he wouldn't marry Quinn.",
        "Brooke: I'm not sure.",
        "Katie: You think Quinn is more important to him than his daughter?",
        "Brooke: I hope not, but he just keeps talking about Quinn and how much she's changed.",
        "Bill: She hasn't.",
        "Brooke: I just feel bad for hope. She's finally really opened up to her father, and now this. He doesn't seem to think it's gonna destroy their relationship, but I'm not so sure.",
        "Katie: I'm sorry.",
        "Brooke: What can you do? I mean, I've tried everything I possibly can. Nothing seems to be making a difference.",
        "Bill: Proving what I've said all along -- those two losers deserve each other.",
        "Katie: [Sighs]",
        "Carter: Deacon, Quinn, join hands and make your statement of intent.",
        "Carter: Deacon, do you take Quinn to be your wife, to have and to hold from this day forward, for better or for worse, for richer or for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, forsaking all others has long as you live?",
        "Deacon: I do.",
        "Carter: Quinn, do you take Deacon to be your husband, to have and to hold from this day forward, for better or for worse, for richer or for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, forsaking all others as long as you live?",
        "Quinn: I do.",
        "Carter: You may now make your pledge to each other by the making of vows and the exchanging of rings.",
        "Quinn: And the other thing.",
        "Deacon: Right. What -- what other thing?",
        "Quinn: Oh, no. You'll find out. [Chuckles, clears throat] You know I don't like making promises -- limiting myself like that, not having any options. It never felt right to me until I met you. I always thought being in a serious relationship would make me feel tied down. But instead, you built me up. You supported me. I never really thought I would ever find a man who -- who truly appreciated me, who loves me for -- exactly the way that I am... a man that I could put up with and who could put up with me.",
        "Deacon: [Chuckles] So, that's your promise -- to put up with me?",
        "Quinn: For the rest of my life, no matter what... even if it seems impossible, because... Deacon, since the day I met you, nothing is impossible to me.",
        "Deacon: I'll take it.",
        "Quinn: And you'll like it.",
        "Deacon: [Laughs]",
        "Quinn: [Laughs]",
        "Carter: Deacon, you can make your vow to Quinn.",
        "Deacon: Pretty much everybody thinks this is a bad idea. You heard hope. You heard Brooke. They both think we're doomed. They think I'm gonna make you miserable and you're gonna ruin my life. But, see, here's the thing -- this is my vow to you, Quinn. I promise you we're gonna prove them all wrong, because that's what we've been doing all our life. We've been fighting against the odds, and we've been winning. But now we're gonna keep fighting against it, but we're gonna be doing it together. And all those people who doubted us -- they better watch out, because we're gonna prove to all of them that we can make each other happier than they ever imagined.",
        "Carter: Do you have the rings?",
        "Wyatt: Uh, yeah -- right here.",
        "Deacon: [Chuckles]",
        "Carter: Deacon and Quinn, these rings remind you of the vows you made to each other. Wear them as a symbol of your devotion to one another. Deacon, take this ring, put it on Quinn's finger, and repeat after me. I give you this ring as a token of my faith in us and my love for you.",
        "Deacon: I give you this ring as a token of my faith in us and my love for you.",
        "Carter: Now, Quinn, you say --",
        "Quinn: Deacon, I give you this ring as a token of my faith in us... and my love for you.",
        "Deacon: What happened to \"take your time\"?",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles]",
        "Carter: Uh, Deacon, I'm gonna need you to take her hand -- your right and her left.",
        "Deacon: Uh, what's that?",
        "Quinn: This is my surprise.",
        "Deacon: I thought you said you wanted a traditional wedding.",
        "Quinn: This is one of the oldest traditions for a wedding that there is.",
        "Deacon: Okay. [Chuckles]",
        "Carter: Deacon and Quinn, this is a symbol of the bond you created today. Your hearts and your lives will be as united as your hands are tied... to work together, to help and to hold one another the rest of your lives. You've sealed your vows with the exchanging of rings and the fasting of hands.",
        "Quinn: You can't get away from me now.",
        "Deacon: I don't want to.",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles]",
        "Carter: It is my pleasure to pronounce you husband and wife.",
