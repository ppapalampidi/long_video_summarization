        "Bonnie: Dusty, do you have a minute?",
        "Dusty: What'd I do now?",
        "Bonnie: Nothing. And I want to thank you for that.",
        "Dusty: For keeping my distance from meg?",
        "Bonnie: Yes. I didn't think you could do it, but you actually let the police handle things, for once.",
        "Dusty: Well, it doesn't seem like they're making much progress. Eliza and paul are still missing.",
        "Bonnie: Well, that may change now that meg's done the video.",
        "Dusty: What kind of video?",
        "Bonnie: One where she speaks directly to paul and asked him to bring eliza home.",
        "Dusty: What are you gonna do with it?",
        "Bonnie: We already put it up on the internet.",
        "Dusty: Are you serious?",
        "Bonnie: Yeah.",
        "Dusty: You got to take it down, bonnie.",
        "Bonnie: Why?",
        "Dusty: Because if paul sees it, it's gonna drive him further into hiding.",
        "Damian: How are you feeling?",
        "Meg: Uh, just a little run down.",
        "Damian: Well, I think I have some news that will make you feel better. The video you made?",
        "Meg: Mm?",
        "Damian: It's already had over 280,000 hits on the web.",
        "Meg: That many? Really?",
        "Damian: Yeah, people all over the world are watching it.",
        "Meg: That seems surreal.",
        "Damian: Just think, out of all those people, we just need one to recognize paul and eliza from the video.",
        "Meg: And then we'll finally know where paul has taken my little girl.",
        "Meg: I know you love our little girl as much as i do. And I know you took her because you're scared of losing her.",
        "Rosanna: Hey, how's miss eliza?",
        "Paul: I think she likes the fresh air. I've never seen her sleep so much. She's very happy.",
        "Rosanna: I know how she feels.",
        "Paul: I'll never forget what you've done for us.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, come on. I didn't do that much.",
        "Paul: Sure you did. You got edna to let us stay here, and I think it's been great for eliza to spend more than just a few days in the same place.",
        "Rosanna: Yeah. Well, I also told edna that you would earn your keep, so get to work. Mush.",
        "Paul: Yes, ma'am. What do I do?",
        "Rosanna: Well, why don't you take the basket and start with those asparagus over there?",
        "Paul: Okay.",
        "Rosanna: Try not to break the stems.",
        "Paul: Oh, fear not. No harm will come to the asparagi on my watch.",
        "Rosanna: Thank you.",
        "Paul: Uh-huh.",
        "Carly: Uh, no, excuse me. I didn't order that.",
        "Bartender: No, this is from my friend gus over there. He's been waiting for you to finish that one.",
        "Craig: Carly? It's craig. Come on, open up. Parker. Parker, I can see you there. Would you open the door, please?",
        "Parker: What?",
        "Craig: What?",
        "Parker: Okay, you were calling my mom, not me.",
        "Craig: Please forgive me. Is your mother home?",
        "Parker: No.",
        "Craig: Do you have any idea where she is?",
        "Parker: No, I don'T. I just came downstairs, and she wasn't here.",
        "Carly: Gus, is it? Look, I'm sure that you're a very nice guy, and under other circumstances, I'd probably be very flattered to have you buy me a drink. But right now I -- I have to say no. But thank you.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "Carly: What now? Hello?",
        "Craig: Where are you?",
        "Carly: Why do you want to know? Where are you?",
        "Craig: I'm at your place.",
        "Carly: You just missed me.",
        "Craig: I gathered that. Where did you go?",
        "Carly: I just ran out to get some art supplies. You know, if we're gonna be starting this new venture.",
        "Craig: Well, you, uh -- you must have left in a hurry. Your son didn't even know you had gone.",
        "Carly: I warned you about checking up on me, craig.",
        "Craig: I'm not. I had a fantastic idea for our new vitamin water logo, and I wanted to run it by you.",
        "Carly: Well, I guess we'll have to discuss it some other time.",
        "Craig: Or I could come meet you at the store.",
        "Carly: Don't bother.",
        "Craig: It's no bother.",
        "Carly: You know, it would be for me. I'm almost through here. I'm headed home.",
        "Craig: Great. I'll wait for you here. Is that a problem?",
        "Carly: Only if you make it one.",
        "Craig: Meaning?",
        "Carly: Craig, if we're gonna be working together again, you're gonna have to learn to trust me.",
        "Craig: I do trust you, carly. I trust that you'll be home soon, and we can get down to business.",
        "Carly: I don't want you to get the wrong impression. I'm smart enough to know that this is a really bad idea.",
        "Gus: Hey, life's too short to live without a few transgressions.",
        "Carly: You don't know my life. And if you say you'd like to, I'm walking out that door.",
        "Gus: Okay.",
        "Carly: Fantastic. So, here's to it.",
        "Parker: You're still here?",
        "Craig: I'm waiting for your mother.",
        "Parker: Does she know that?",
        "Craig: Just spoke to her.",
        "Parker: Great. I'm sure she'll be back any minute now.",
        "Craig: She tell you about our new business venture?",
        "Parker: What, the water thing? Yeah. It's original.",
        "Craig: We would love it if you got involved with our launch campaign.",
        "Parker: Sorry, but I'm not interested.",
        "Craig: Why not? Chicks dig models.",
        "Parker: Whatever.",
        "Craig: All of our research tells us that our target demographic would be teens and young adults, so it would be a big help if you got involved.",
        "Parker: Why should I help you?",
        "Craig: Just what is your problem, parker?",
        "Parker: Excuse me?",
        "Craig: You know, you want to stay mad at me, knock yourself ouT. Stay mad at me.",
        "Parker: Okay.",
        "Craig: But your mother doesn't deserve this kind of attitude from you.",
        "Parker: So now you're going to lecture me?",
        "Craig: No, no, no. That would be a waste of time. So I'm just going to tell you how it is. Your mother is in some serious trouble right now.",
        "Parker: Yeah, her drinking problem? I noticed. And you think your little vitamin water plan is going to help her?",
        "Craig: No. But you could.",
        "Parker: Really?",
        "Craig: Way I see it, parker, you have a choice. You can either get involved and try to help her through this, or you can stand by, wallowing in teen angst, and watch her go under. Now, what's it going to be?",
        "Carly: Okay, well, I really do need to be going. I have somebody waiting for me at home.",
        "Bartender: I didn't know you were married.",
        "Carly: I'm not married. Anymore.",
        "Bartender: Boyfriend?",
        "Carly: Well, I hate to break it you, fellas, but it isn't always about some man.",
        "Bartender: So then stay. Don't leave us.",
        "Carly: Maybe some other time, huh?",
        "Parker: My mom isn't perfect, but she was doing all right before you came back.",
        "Craig: Oh, I've made some mistakes where she's concerned, but at least I'm not hell-bent on repeating them.",
        "Parker: Okay. Then, why don't you leave?",
        "Craig: And what good would that do? If I were to turn my back on her, like you?",
        "Parker: Me? It's your stupid vodka company that started this. She never drank like this before.",
        "Craig: And I'm trying to do something about that.",
        "Parker: Yeah, by blaming me. Trying to make me feel guilty. But I'm not falling for it.",
        "Craig: Well, maybe you should feel guilty, parker. It's not like you've made this any easier on her.",
        "Parker: Oh, like you're one to talk.",
        "Craig: You run away, you get married, you get divorced, you buy a car, and then you drop out of school. Do you really think your actions don't have an affect on her?",
        "Parker: What about her? It's not like she's never messed up before. I mean, she ran out on us.",
        "Craig: When are you gonna stop punishing her for being human and failing? She's gone out of her way to make up for that. If you really cared about her, you'd take some responsibility yourself.",
        "Paul: You know, I can see why you like it out here. It's great. I don't even mind doing the work.",
        "Rosanna: That's 'cause you've only been at it for a few hours. Wait till you put in a full day and you've got nothing to show for it but calloused fingers and a sore back.",
        "Paul: Oh, wait a second. You never said anything about calloused fingers. I have to be careful with a violin career.",
        "Edna: How's it going here?",
        "Paul: Excellent.",
        "Edna: Uh-huh. You know, your little girl's gonna get too much sun out here.",
        "Paul: Yeah? I'll move her.",
        "Edna: Just keep working. I can take her.",
        "Paul: No, no, no. You know what? I'll just -- I'll put her over there, in the shade.",
        "Edna: What do you think I'm going to do? I'm gonna break her?",
        "Paul: No, I don't think you're gonna -- I just -- I'm not so comfortable with her being out of my sight. That's all.",
        "Edna: Oh, well, what do you mean \"out of your sight\"? I'm just gonna be right down there at the stand. It's cooler down there. You leave her out here, you're not going to be able to find a lick of shade.",
        "Paul: Okay. Well, if she starts fussing or crying or something, you come get me, right? Okay. You take care. Be a good girl for aunty edna.",
        "Edna: She'll be just fine.",
        "Paul: She has some experience taking care of kids, right?",
        "Rosanna: Oh, would you relax? This is a good sign. Shows that she's starting to accept you being here. Trust me, edna's someone you want on your side. Ah, rats.",
        "Meg: Oh, my god, damian, it's eliza! I never took that photo.",
        "Damian: What does the e-mail say?",
        "Meg: \"I know where your baby is. I can bring her to you. Be at the junction of routes 45 and 54 in wisconsin at 4:00 P.M. There are innocent people involved, so come alone. No police. The photo is proof this is not a joke.\" Oh, my god. I need to leave now.",
        "Damian: Wait, wait. You just can't go racing off like this.",
        "Meg: Damian, I have to go. The junction of route 45 and 54, that is near the airfield where we followed barbara when she went to meet paul. This is real.",
        "Damian: I'm not saying that it isn'T.",
        "Meg: Then I need to go. If I'm going to get my baby back, I need to leave now.",
        "Dusty: That video's a big mistake if paul sees it.",
        "Bonnie: Well, it's too late. It's already out there, and we can't take it back.",
        "Dusty: I wish you had run this by me first.",
        "Bonnie: It wasn't your decision to make.",
        "Dusty: I would've warned you.",
        "Meg: Bonnie, hey. We found them.",
        "Bonnie: What? Where?",
        "Meg: In wisconsin. I'm going there now.",
        "Dusty: Yourself?",
        "Meg: Yeah, that's what they asked me to do.",
        "Dusty: Who did?",
        "Damian: We got a response from someone who saw the video.",
        "Meg: They showed me a picture of eliza, and they said they wanted to give her back to me.",
        "Dusty: What do they want in return?",
        "Meg: Nothing.",
        "Dusty: Just for you to meet them alone?",
        "Meg: Yeah.",
        "Dusty: Doesn't sound right.",
        "Bonnie: I agree. I think we need to tell the police.",
        "Meg: No, we can't do that! They said not to.",
        "Dusty: How do you know this is legit?",
        "Meg: Because! The destination -- it's near where paul was hiding before, when he asked barbara to meet him.",
        "Dusty: When was this?",
        "Meg: Look, it doesn't matter. I just want to make sure that all the paperwork is in order when I bring eliza home.",
        "Bonnie: It is. Everything's been filed.",
        "Meg: So I have custody?",
        "Bonnie: Full custody. There's even a restraining order out on paul.",
        "Meg: Okay, good. 'Cause I don't want him anywhere near my daughter ever again.",
        "Bonnie: You know, meg, I just have to ask you one more time. Are you sure that you don't want to inform the police about this?",
        "Meg: Yes, I am sure. I'm going to do exactly what they want me to do, and I don't care what it is, as long as I get my daughter back. I have to go.",
        "Dusty: Wait a second.",
        "Dusty: You don't look good. You feeling all right?",
        "Carly: Hi.",
        "Craig: Hi.",
        "Carly: Sorry. Traffic was a nightmare.",
        "Craig: I wasn't worried.",
        "Carly: But, on the plus side, I now have everything I need to make this a very productive afternoon.",
        "Craig: That's great.",
        "Carly: Oh, hi, you. What's going on?",
        "Parker: Nothing. I just heard your car pull in.",
        "Carly: Right, yeah, I'm sorry that I didn't tell you that I was going out to shop.",
        "Parker: It's cool.",
        "Carly: Oh, will you bring these up to sage's room? She's been after me all week for another set.",
        "Parker: Sure.",
        "Carly: Thanks. Are you okay?",
        "Parker: Yeah. Yeah, everything's fine.",
        "Carly: Oh. What was that all about?",
        "Craig: I think he's just looking out for you.",
        "Carly: Well, I wish he didn't feel like he had to do that anymore.",
        "Craig: You all right?",
        "Carly: Yeah, yeah. Why wouldn't I be?",
        "Craig: Just asking.",
        "Carly: Don't look for trouble where there isn't any, okay?",
        "Craig: Okay, I won'T. You have my word.",
        "[Both chuckle]",
        "Carly: So, what was this fantastic idea you had?",
        "Craig: Well, I've had several since last we spoke. But the most important one is I think I've come up with a name for our new line. It's kind of a play on midnight sun.",
        "Carly: And it is?",
        "Craig: Midday sun.",
        "Carly: Oh. Midday sun vitamin water.",
        "Craig: What do you think?",
        "Carly: I think it could work.",
        "Craig: Beautiful! Feels like we picked up right where we left off.",
        "Carly: But I can't be sure, of course, until I start working up some sketches.",
        "Craig: Oh, you're kicking me out?",
        "Carly: As politely as I can.",
        "Craig: Okay, I'll take the hint. But, you know, if you need anything or you want some more inspiration --",
        "Carly: I will absolutely call you. Thanks.",
        "Craig: Bye.",
        "Carly: Bye.",
        "Rosanna: You know, I think I've picked more in five minutes than you have all day. Paul?",
        "Paul: What?",
        "Rosanna: What's wrong?",
        "Paul: I don't like being separated from eliza like this.",
        "Rosanna: You're not separated. She's up there with edna, cooling her little heels at the stand.",
        "Paul: But I don't know edna.",
        "Rosanna: Well, I do, and I know she may seem a little rough around the edges, but deep down, she's a real sweetheart.",
        "Paul: Okay. And underneath that?",
        "Rosanna: She likes red meat.",
        "Paul: I'm gonna go.",
        "Rosanna: No, no, no, no, no! Wait, wait, wait, wait! Come on. Edna's finally starting to accept you as one of us. The best thing you can do is just to let her take care of eliza for a little while.",
        "Paul: Yeah, you see, that's just the thing. I'm not one of you. I'm gonna go get my little girl.",
        "Meg: Dusty, look, I'm fine, okay? I already told you it's -- it's nerves!",
        "Bonnie: Are you sure, meg?",
        "Meg: Yes! Yes. Look, I'm a nurse. I would know if something was wrong, and it's not.",
        "Bonnie: As much as I hate to agree with dusty, you do look a bit flushed.",
        "Meg: Look, it's just stress, okay? It's gonna stop once I get my daughter back.",
        "Damian: All right, then allow me to go with you.",
        "Meg: No!",
        "Damian: I won't interfere. I'll keep my distance. I promise. But I will feel better if I knew that you weren't going out there alone.",
        "Dusty: I'd feel better if you don't go at all.",
        "Meg: Okay, you're not gonna stop me, okay? So don't even try. I am not gonna lose my daughter again.",
        "Dusty: What if you're walking into a trap?",
        "Meg: The e-mail said to come alone, and I'm gonna do exactly as they tell me to. Now I need to go.",
        "Paul: Edna? Edna! Hey, stop! What are you doing? You are not going anywhere with my daughter!",
        "Carly: See, carly? You can handle this. It's not bad, actually.",
        "[Doorbell rings]",
        "Carly: You got to be kidding me. Craig, what no-- gus? What are you doing here? Did you follow me here? Don't even answer that. Just go, okay?",
        "Gus: But I brought the fun stuff. Come on, so we can party. Come on.",
        "Carly: Uh, no, I don't want to party, gus. Look, I'm, uh -- I'm sorry if I gave you the wrong impression. I really am. But I am not interested in -- in any of this, okay? And, actually, I'm doing some work, so you need to go, okay? Please, come on.",
        "Gus: But did anybody tell you how beautiful you are?",
        "Carly: I'm surprised you can tell with how red your eyes are. Now I mean it. You have to go, or I'm going to call the cops.",
        "Gus: Oh, wait. You were so nice to me before down at yo'S.",
        "Carly: Yeah, clearly that was a mistake.",
        "Gus: Well, it doesn't have to be. We could make it right.",
        "Carly: No, don'T. Okay, don'T.",
        "Parker: Get your hands off my mother! Get the hell out!",
        "Gus: Whoa!",
        "Carly: Oh, parker, I'm so sorry.",
        "Parker: Who was that?",
        "Carly: I don't know. I don't know. He must have followed me from the art store.",
        "Parker: Yeah. Or maybe you met him at yo's?",
        "Carly: What? No.",
        "Parker: I heard him, mom. About how nice you were to him before.",
        "Carly: Oh, my god.",
        "Parker: So don't even try to tell me that you met him at the art store, mom. You met him 'cause he was sitting on a bar stool right next to you.",
        "Carly: It's not like I was out getting wasted, parker. I had one drink.",
        "Parker: Only one?",
        "Carly: Two. I had two drinks, but only because he bought one for me.",
        "Parker: That guy bought you a drink? And you let him?",
        "Carly: I didn't encourage hiM. He just did it.",
        "Parker: Well, you could have said no! No wonder he followed you here.",
        "Carly: Don't look at me like that.",
        "Parker: You're really starting to scare me, mom.",
        "Carly: No, you don't have anything to be scared of, parker. I swear.",
        "Parker: Mom, you're picking up guys that you meet at bars!",
        "Carly: I didn't pick him up! He followed me! And it's not gonna happen again, okay? I promise.",
        "Parker: You can't, can you?",
        "Carly: What do you mean?",
        "Parker: You may say that you're going to stop drinking, and you really may mean it, but -- you can'T. You can't stop.",
        "Craig: She said she's fine, craig. She's fine. You're just gonna have to trust her.",
        "Carly: I do want to stop. I've never wanted anything more in my life.",
        "Parker: But you can'T.",
        "Carly: I will.",
        "Parker: Then why don't you?",
        "Carly: Because it's -- it's not that easy.",
        "Parker: Do you really need this?",
        "Carly: No. No, it's -- it's just that sometimes things happen, and I let them get to me, and I have a few drinks to take the edge off. And I know how this sounds.",
        "Parker: Why do you need to calm down? Is it because of things that I do?",
        "Carly: No. This has nothing to do with you.",
        "Parker: Yeah, but I know I make you mad.",
        "Carly: Well, I know I make you mad. But I love you. And I do know better than this. I do.",
        "Parker: Then why can't you stop?",
        "Carly: I keep telling myself to. And I try. But then something takes over, and I give in. I'm sorry. I shouldn't be talking to you about this. Honey, you're too young to understand. You shouldn't understand.",
        "Parker: No, it's all right. I -- I kind of know what you're talking about.",
        "Carly: You do?",
        "Parker: Yeah. I'm sort of the same way.",
        "Carly: Please tell me you're not drinking.",
        "Parker: No, no, no, mom. It's just -- it's the way I am. I mean, I can hear myself being a jerk -- to you, to dad, to liberty -- and I tell myself that I need to stop, but -- but I can't, and I hear myself just -- I still act like an idiot. And I hurt people. I'm sorry.",
        "Carly: I know. I know you are. Oh, parker, you are so much like me. And I am so sorry about that.",
        "Paul: Answer me. Where the hell do you think you're going with my little girl?",
        "Edna: Where do you think? I know what you've done!",
        "Rosanna: Okay, what's going on, here? Paul?",
        "Paul: She was trying to take off with eliza.",
        "Edna: I was bringing her back to her mama -- where she belongs.",
        "Rosanna: What?",
        "Edna: I saw a video about this one on the internet. Eliza's mama made it. He kidnapped this child, and her mother was begging him to bring her home!",
        "Paul: Eliza belongs with me.",
        "Rosanna: Is that where you were taking her?",
        "Edna: I sent her an e-mail. I arranged a place to meet her.",
        "Paul: What? Where?",
        "Edna: Nowheres around here. And I told her if she came alone, I would bring her the baby back.",
        "Paul: You -- you -- you can't do that.",
        "Edna: Don't you tell me what I can and cannot do! You're lucky I haven't called the police!",
        "Rosanna: Why didn't you call the police, edna?",
        "Edna: Because I didn't want to bring any trouble to this community. But if you try to stop me from leaving, I will. I will call them right now.",
        "Dusty: How you feeling?",
        "Meg: I'm fine. I just got dizzy.",
        "Bonnie: Meg, you passed out.",
        "Meg: That's 'cause I didn't have enough to eat this morning, okay? I'll -- I'll just grab something on the way to wisconsin.",
        "Dusty: No, no, no, no. You're going to the hospital, and you're gonna get checked out.",
        "Meg: No. I am going to get my daughter.",
        "Dusty: You're in no shape to travel.",
        "Damian: I'll go.",
        "Dusty: I'm going with you.",
        "Meg: No, no! Neither of you is going! Do you hear me?",
        "Dusty: Why not? Why?",
        "Meg: Because! Whoever I'm supposed to meet is expecting a woman, not the two of you!",
        "Bonnie: What if I went?",
        "Meg: Bonnie --",
        "Bonnie: No. You said they're expecting a woman. Meg, let me go in your place. I might be less intimidating to them.",
        "Dusty: If things get out of hand, how are you gonna protect yourself?",
        "Bonnie: I'm a lawyer, dusty.",
        "Dusty: You have no idea what you're walking into.",
        "Bonnie: No, if there's negotiating to be done, I can do it. And if paul's nearby, I can cut a deal with him, too.",
        "Dusty: You think these guys can be reasoned with?",
        "Meg: Dusty. Are you sure you want to do this?",
        "Bonnie: I want to bring your little girl home, meg.",
        "Meg: Thank you. Promise me you'll be careful.",
        "Bonnie: I will.",
        "Dusty: What are you going to do?",
        "Meg: Just going to sit here and wait.",
        "Damian: I'll take her upstairs. We'll get something to eat, some room service, and she can rest until she gets stronger.",
        "Dusty: What if that doesn't do the trick?",
        "Damian: I'll take her to the hospital, then.",
        "Meg: Damian --",
        "Damian: Don't fight me on this. Please. You okay to walk?",
        "Meg: Yeah, just -- just go slow. Call me the minute you hear anything, okay?",
        "Bonnie: Yeah, I will. I will.",
        "Meg: Thank you.",
        "Bonnie: I'd better get to wisconsin if I'm going to make it in time.",
        "Dusty: I'm going with you.",
        "Bonnie: The hell you are.",
        "Paul: Edna, please. Please don't call the police.",
        "Edna: Are you going to give me a reason to?",
        "Paul: Just hear me out before you do anything. Please.",
        "Edna: I'm listening.",
        "Paul: Okay, that video that you saw, if meg made it, it probably doesn't make me look like the nicest guy in the world.",
        "Edna: Well, that would be one way to put it.",
        "Paul: Because I'm not. You know, I've done a lot of terrible things, and I've -- I've hurt a lot of people. But that little girl, having her, loving her, being her father has changed me. Eliza -- she is the best of me.",
        "Edna: Well, I'm sure her mama feels the same way.",
        "Paul: Yeah, maybe so, but she's trying to take her away from me. And she has no legal right to do so. You can go in there and get back on the internet and check. I have legal custody.",
        "Edna: Yeah? And if I do that, what else am i going to find out?",
        "Paul: Well, that -- like I said, I've done a lot of stupid things. And I've hurt a lot of people, rosanna included.",
        "Rosanna: Paul --",
        "Paul: Well, it's true, isn't it? But look at her. She's trying to forgive me. And maybe that has something to do with being here. I don't know. This -- this -- this -- this place -- it's brought her some peace. And all I'm asking is for the same thing. And not just for me, for eliza, too. She deserves peace, and if she goes back to oakdale, she's never gonna have it.",
        "Edna: Don't you think her mama deserves the same consideration?",
        "Paul: You want the truth?",
        "Edna: If you can find it.",
        "Paul: She betrayed me. She broke my heart.",
        "Edna: Are you talking another man?",
        "Paul: Yeah. I'm talking about another man. And now he comes first. Before anything, even the family that we built together. And I'm this close. The only thing holding it together for me is that little girl. Please don't take her away from me. Being here, I've realized so much about myself. I've questioned everything that used to be important, and I think it's going to make me a better father to eliza.",
        "Edna: You knew about all this?",
        "Rosanna: Yeah, I did.",
        "Edna: Don't make me regret this.",
        "Paul: Okay. It's okay, baby girl. Daddy's here. Daddy.",
        "Rosanna: You know, I got to hand it to you, paul. You were pretty convincing.",
        "Paul: Well, the truth usually is.",
        "Dusty: You can't do this alone.",
        "Bonnie: Why not? Because I'm a woman?",
        "Dusty: Because you have no idea what's waiting for you on the other end.",
        "Bonnie: Maybe not. But at least I know I will not have to worry about you.",
        "Dusty: Worry about me? Doing what?",
        "Bonnie: I don't know. Pulling out a gun, shooting someone? What's your excuse going to be then, dusty?",
        "Dusty: Public service.",
        "Bonnie: Mm-hmm. You want to perform a public service? Then stand down and let me do my job.",
        "Carly: You know, sometimes I wonder if you were more like your father, if things would be easier for you.",
        "Parker: You ever come up with an answer?",
        "Carly: No.",
        "Parker: \"No\" as in \"it wouldn't be\" or \"no\" as in \"you don't have an answer\"?",
        "Carly: I don'T. I don'T. I don't let myself get that far.",
        "Parker: Why not?",
        "Carly: Because I love who you are so much, I can't imagine you any other way. But I know that I'm to blame for a lot of the pain you're in right now.",
        "Parker: Mom --",
        "Carly: And I'm sorry for that.",
        "Parker: It's okay.",
        "Carly: I'm really sorry. Is it, really?",
        "Parker: Mom, I've hurt you, too. And I'm sorry.",
        "Carly: Apology accepted. You know, maybe we can help each other.",
        "Parker: Help each other how?",
        "Carly: I think we'd both feel better if we had somebody on our side who really understood who we are, how we think. I will accept the choices that you make in your life if you accept mine.",
        "Parker: You need to quit drinking. But you haven'T.",
        "Carly: Well, not in the way that other people like craig and your father want me to. They want me to go to these A.A. Meetings. And I've tried that. I have. It just doesn't work for me.",
        "Parker: Yeah, well, you made me go to therapy when I didn't want to go. Isn't that the same thing?",
        "Carly: Did it work? Making you do something you didn't want to do?",
        "Parker: No. It pretty much sucked.",
        "Carly: You see? Too much alike again. We need to do things in our own way, in our own time.",
        "Parker: But with your drinking, I mean, shouldn't you be getting help?",
        "Carly: Why? Because that's what people expect of me? Aren't people telling you that you should be in school? But you're not because you know it's not what you need right now.",
        "Parker: And that's okay with you?",
        "Carly: If you're okay with the decisions I make for myself.",
        "Parker: What about dad?",
        "Carly: Sometimes, what people want you to do, and what you're able to do, aren't the same thing.",
        "Parker: Mom, you need to get better.",
        "Carly: I will. We both will. Don't get any popcorn on my couch.",
        "Bonnie: What the hell are you doing here?",
        "Dusty: I'm watching you. That's some lean you got there.",
        "Bonnie: No, I told you to stay in oakdale!",
        "Dusty: Yeah, I know what you told me. So, where are they?",
        "Bonnie: I don't know. Maybe they saw you watching me, and you scared them off, dusty.",
        "Dusty: Or maybe they're not coming at all.",
        "Meg: She needs you. And she needs me. You're a good father, paul. And there have been times where I may have forgotten that. And that wasn't fair to yoU. Or to her.",
        "Rosanna: You know, if edna's seen this, it means a lot of other people have, too.",
        "Paul: So what?",
        "Rosanna: So the longer this video is out there, the harder it is for you to stay under the radar.",
        "Paul: I'll deal with it.",
        "Rosanna: You're still in love with her.",
        "Paul: No. No. I'm not. I'm not in love with meg. Not anymore.",
        "Rosanna: Don't do that.",
        "Paul: Don't do what?",
        "Rosanna: Lie to yourself.",
        "Paul: I'm not lying to myself.",
        "Rosanna: So you're telling me that if she called you right now and said, \"come home. Bring eliza home to me, and let's get back together,\" that you wouldn't --",
        "Paul: She can't call me. I have a blocked number. It's disposable. She has no way to reach me.",
        "Rosanna: Oh, come on, paul.",
        "Paul: What? What does it matter?",
        "Rosanna: What do you mean, \"what does it matter?\" It matters that if you ran away with eliza because you're jealous --",
        "Paul: I'm not jealous.",
        "Rosanna: Or because you're trying to get back at her for being with some other man, then what you're doing is wrong, and you know that.",
        "Paul: Really? What about what she did to me?",
        "Rosanna: Well, that's your problem. But it's no reason to keep this little girl away from her mother.",
        "Meg: Why hasn't she called? You know, maybe I should call her.",
        "Damian: No, no.",
        "Meg: Why?",
        "Damian: Because we don't know where she is, who she's with. We don't want to call her at the wrong time.",
        "Meg: Right. You're right. I just hate waiting. I'm burning up.",
        "Damian: Let me cool you down.",
        "Dusty: Give it up, bonnie. They're not coming.",
        "Bonnie: It's because you scared them off, dusty.",
        "Dusty: They're over an hour late. This whole thing was a hoax.",
        "Bonnie: Just like you said it was? Go to hell.",
        "Dusty: Where you going?",
        "Bonnie: Why? You planning on following me again?",
        "Dusty: Good luck to you, sweetheart.",
        "[Engine struggling]",
        "Bonnie: No. Oh, come on.",
        "Dusty: What?",
        "Bonnie: My car won't start. I need a ride into town.",
        "Dusty: What happened to \"go to hell\"?",
        "Bonnie: You could still make it. Just drop me off first. What are you waiting for? Drive. My car's just down the road. I need a tow. It won't start.",
        "Mechanic: Got one truck, and it's on a run right now.",
        "Bonnie: Well, how long am I going to have to wait?",
        "Mechanic: Maybe an hour, two, tops.",
        "Dusty: Have fun.",
        "Bonnie: No, wait. You can't just leave me here.",
        "Dusty: Sorry. I'm under strict orders. I got to get down to hell.",
        "Bonnie: Oh, no, you don'T. Look around. This is hell. So you're gonna stay right where you are.",
        "Parker: What are you doing here?",
        "Craig: I thought your mom could use a snack.",
        "Parker: Yeah, well, she knows how to make her own coffee.",
        "Craig: Ah, but I brought cookies. Where is she?",
        "Parker: She went to a meeting.",
        "Craig: An A.A. Meeting?",
        "Parker: At the hospital.",
        "Craig: Wow, I'm impressed.",
        "Parker: Yeah, we talked, and we decided that she needs to get help.",
        "Craig: Well, all right. You done good, kid. I knew if anybody could get through to her, it would be you. I'll just leave these here, then. Do me a favor.",
        "Parker: What?",
        "Craig: When she comes back, tell her I'm proud of her. There's plenty of cookies in there for two if you want.",
        "[Parker sighs]",
        "Carly: Thank you. I just couldn't deal with him right now.",
        "Parker: You know he's just gonna be back in another hour.",
        "Carly: Hey. We're going to get through this, you know. As long as we have each other.",
        "Parker: I know.",
        "Carly: We don't need anybody telling us how to fix what they think is wrong with us. Okay?",
        "Paul: When I left with eliza, it wasn't to get revenge on meg.",
        "Rosanna: You know, I'd like to believe that, paul, but --",
        "Paul: Well, then believe it because it's true. I would never use my little girl as a weapon. Not ever. Especially not against her mother.",
        "Rosanna: Well, I sincerely hope not. I'm going to go see if edna needs any help.",
        "Damian: How are you feeling?",
        "Meg: Better, thanks.",
        "Damian: Good. You still have a fever. Why don't you try and get some rest?",
        "Meg: No. If bonnie calls --",
        "Damian: I'll wake you. Don't worry. I'll also call lily and let her know where you are.",
        "Meg: Thank you.",
        "[Cell phone ringing]",
        "Damian: Hello? Is anyone there?",
        "Dusty: Why do you want me to stick around? To protect your pricey shoes from all the dirt?",
        "Bonnie: Come on. You know what? Get over yourself.",
        "Dusty: Well, you're the one who wants me to stick around.",
        "Bonnie: Well, it's in case my car can't be fixed and I need a ride home, dusty.",
        "Dusty: You get your ride, I'll get mine.",
        "Bonnie: Look, look, if this whole eliza thing is just a big hoax, where do you have to be, anyways?",
        "Dusty: Out there, looking for her.",
        "Bonnie: Come on, honestly, how long is it going to take to get my car in here for you to look at it?",
        "Mechanic: Man, are all you people from illinois this impatient?",
        "Bonnie: It's the water.",
        "Dusty: Wait a sec. You said, \"all you people from illinois.\" Has someone else from illinois been here?",
        "Mechanic: Mm-hmm.",
        "Dusty: When?",
        "Mechanic: Two or three days ago.",
        "Dusty: Was it a man with a baby? A little baby girl?",
        "Mechanic: He was ticked we couldn't fix his car fast enough.",
        "Bonnie: Oh, my god.",
        "Dusty: Paul's here. Next week on \"as the world turns --\"",
        "Vienna: Tell him.",
        "Brad: Tell me what?",
        "Katie: I'm pregnant.",
        "Margo: It's not possible. Adam's not dead. I would know.",
        "Bonnie: That's the baby I saw at the pharmacy.",
        "Dusty: Are you sure?",
        "Bonnie: Now I'm positive. We found eliza.",
        "Rosanna: If you don't want to bring eliza back home, and you dot want to get arrested, then you have got to get out of here now."
