        "Reva rushes into the Museum looking for Marah. She is concerned that her visions of Marah's involvement in Carrie's shooting are accurate. Michelle tells her that Marah is asleep and offers to check on her. When she returns and tells Reva that Marah is not there. Reva heads to the police station where she thinks Marah has gone after Josh.",
        "At the police station, Marah tries to confess to Jeffrey that she was the one who shot Carrie and that she won't let her father take the blame. But both Josh and Jeffrey try to dissuade her and do everything they can to prevent her from confessing. When she realizes how hard her father is trying to stop her, she becomes more convinced that her memory is correct and she is the one who shot Carrie. At Cutter's Bridge, Gus tries to get Alan to agree to make a deal with Jeffrey. He thinks he can get Jeffrey to accept a plea of Diminished Capacity to the accidental drowning of Maryanne Caruthers in exchange for Alan giving them access to Spaulding Enterprises' records on the distribution of Antimonius. Alan is adamant that he has a responsibility to his family and his stockholders and he can never allow that to happen to his company. Danny surprises Michelle with a romantic evening away from her worries. Danny tries to take her mind off what's been going on in her life and wants to pamper her. Then he remembers a letter that came for her and takes it out. When she sees the pink stationary, she recognizes it as Carrie's and shudders to think that Carrie is still alive."

        "Alan: You can keep me out of prison for maryanne's death?",
        "Gus: Well, I can't guarantee anything, but it is possible.",
        "Alan: How?",
        "Gus: Well, if we both tell the truth, for starters. Both of us.",
        "Alan: Tell the truth? Look, I don't have time for clever riddles.",
        "Gus: Yeah, I learned a lot of stuff at spaulding enterprises, alan, and I wish I hadn'T.",
        "Alan: What does that have to do with me driving a car off this bridge?",
        "Gus: Fine, here goes. There's a federal investigation into certain areas of spaulding enterprises, and it's an undercover operation.",
        "Alan: Federal agents have infiltrated my company?",
        "Gus: Yes. And the agent that is heading up this assignment, that would be me.",
        "Alan: What?",
        "Gus: Listen, I only agreed to work with the feds on this because your company was already being targeted, okay, and I knew I could have your back.",
        "Alan: Oh, my god.",
        "Gus: But here's the thing. This thing has gotten a lot bigger than me, alan, so i cannot promise that anymore. And for that... for that, I'm sorry.",
        "Alan: You're sorry? After I've torn myself apart for deceiving you and letting you down as a father when all this time you have been deceiving me?",
        "Reva: Marah's asleep? You're sure?",
        "Michelle: Yeah, she was going up to bed last time I saw her.",
        "Reva: I really need to talk to her.",
        "Michelle: Reva, did something happen after you left here earlier?",
        "Reva: No! No. I just... I have a lot on my mind right now. You know what then? Maybe, can you go up and if she's sleeping, wake her up and tell her I need to see her? It'S... it's really important.",
        "Michelle: Okay. Okay.",
        "Reva: Thanks. Oh, marah.",
        "Josh: Marah, don't say another word.",
        "Marah: Dad, you cannot stop me from telling them...",
        "Josh: Jeffrey, she shouldn't even be here right now, and you know that, so get her out of here.",
        "Marah: I am not leaving...",
        "Josh: No.",
        "Marah: ...Until you release him. He's innocent.",
        "Josh: Marah. Marah, don'T...",
        "Marah: I know that for a fact!",
        "Jeffrey: He's already confessed, marah.",
        "Marah: Well, I know everything that happened.",
        "Josh: No, she doesn'T. Don't listen to her. She's still in shock obviously. She doesn't know what she's saying.",
        "Marah: No, dad, I was in shock, but now it's clear to me.",
        "Jeffrey: Marah, before you say anything more...",
        "Josh: She has nothing to say.",
        "Jeffrey: I remind you that I'm the district attorney...",
        "Josh: She has nothing to say.",
        "Jeffrey: ...And you should speak to a lawyer before you talk to me.",
        "Marah: What difference does it make? The truth is the truth. I lost track of it for a day or so...",
        "Josh: No, no...",
        "Marah: ...But now I remember everything that happened that night.",
        "Josh: Marah...",
        "Marah: I know exactly what happened.",
        "Josh: Stop! Please just stop.",
        "Marah: No, dad, I remember exactly what happened, and i remember my part in it.",
        "Alan: This righteous indignation, is this what keeps a cop going, huh?",
        "Gus: It's just... it comes with the territory sometimes. Look, just for the record, i want you to know that this has been the toughest assignment I've ever taken on. Why? Because I never, for one second, forgot that you are my father.",
        "Alan: It didn't keep you from misleading me, did it?",
        "Gus: I have a job to do.",
        "Alan: Yeah, setting up your old man!",
        "Gus: What would you prefer? I don't understand. Do you want somebody that you don't know going through all of your business, or somebody that loves you, somebody that has your back?",
        "Alan: Please. Don't expect me to believe some kind of story about your son's devotion, because I won'T.",
        "Gus: Alan, there's something very wrong going on at your company.",
        "Alan: Yeah. And you automatically assume that I am behind it, huh?",
        "Gus: No, no. I only went back to work for the feds because I believe that you're innocent.",
        "Alan: Do you still believe that? After I admitted going over this bridge and causing a woman's death and covering it up for 30 years? Huh?",
        "Gus: Yeah. Yeah, I'd like to believe it.",
        "Alan: Hmm. Well, I guess I should be grateful for that. So you came to spaulding not to work with me or phillip but to do a cover story, huh?",
        "Gus: No. No. I was already working at spaulding when they approached me, and that is a fact.",
        "Alan: So you were working for the federal government after i gave you a full carte blanche of spaulding enterprises; opened you to all of the files, any information you desired; introduced you to every head of the department as my son.",
        "Gus: I loved when you did that. That meant a lot to me. I... I felt welcomed.",
        "Alan: Well, this is a hell of a way to show your gratitude.",
        "Gus: Look, I will say it... I'll say it as many times as you want me to say it: I did it to protect you, okay? And I would do it again.",
        "Alan: Why?",
        "Gus: Because you're my father. Listen, I think that we can get the caruthers charges pushed down to diminished capacity and an accidental drowning, okay? And then maybe you can just get probation.",
        "Alan: How do you think that's possible?",
        "Gus: Because I've been thinking about it, and I think o'neill might... he just might give you a deal. And then you can put all this behind you.",
        "Alan: So you would go to the da on my behalf after knowing what happened that night and ever since, huh?",
        "Gus: Yeah. But you're going to have to give me something.",
        "Alan: What's that?",
        "Gus: You're going to have to give me something that I can take to o'neill, trade with him, trade with him for his consideration.",
        "Michelle: She's not up there. Marah's not up there.",
        "Reva: What?",
        "Michelle: She must have slipped out when I moved the car for marina.",
        "Reva: Did you look everywhere? In all the other rooms?",
        "Michelle: I checked all the rooms and her keys are gone and her purse is gone, so she definitely took off.",
        "Reva: Okay. Well, maybe she went to the house, our house.",
        "Michelle: Why? Why would she do that?",
        "Reva: Well, I don't know. She mentioned that maybe she'd come back home for a few days to get some r & r, but she may on her way over there now, so I'll just go meet her. Thanks. Don't worry.",
        "Michelle: Okay.",
        "Danny: Oh, hi.",
        "Reva: Oh, danny.",
        "Danny: You okay?",
        "Reva: Um, yeah. I'm working on it.",
        "Danny: I'm really sorry about what's going on with josh. I hope it resolves itself quickly.",
        "Reva: Thanks. I'm sure it will.",
        "Danny: Let me know if there's anything I can do to help.",
        "Reva: Thanks again.",
        "Danny: Okay.",
        "Michelle: Reva, will you call me when you talk to marah, please?",
        "Reva: Of course. Bye.",
        "Danny: What's going on?",
        "Michelle: Um, I don't know. I don't know. One minute marah was going upstairs to bed, and the next she's gone. So...",
        "Danny: Well, honey, she's upset about everything that's going on with josh.",
        "Michelle: Yeah. Yeah, it hasn't really been easy on anyone. I thought you had a planning session with bill, right?",
        "Danny: I did, but I cut it short.",
        "Michelle: Why?",
        "Danny: Because I'm taking you to the beacon for dinner and a little sleepover.",
        "Michelle: Tonight?",
        "Danny: Yeah. Yeah. It's all set up. Nico's watching robbie, the room is reserved, the champagne is already on ice. All I have to do is get you there. What? It doesn't sound good?",
        "Michelle: No, it sounds great. It's just that I feel like i should stick around until I hear from reva.",
        "Danny: Honey, come on. Reva can take care of marah. She's going to be fine. Let me take care of you. You have been too tense lately. You have. Come on, it'll be fun. It'll be fun. Okay?",
        "Michelle: You're right.",
        "Danny: Let's go. Get your coat. Where's your coat? Let's go.",
        "Michelle: Reva can take care of marah, and I need a night with you.",
        "Danny: That's right. Come on.",
        "Josh: Marah, you had no part in what happened.",
        "Marah: Do you need to get somebody in here to take my statement?",
        "Jeffrey: No.",
        "Josh: She can't make a statement. She wasn't even there when it happened.",
        "Marah: Dad, I was. We both know that.",
        "Josh: No, no, no. You weren'T.",
        "Marah: So nobody needs to be writing this down right now?",
        "Jeffrey: You're not under custody, okay? No one's read you your rights, so whatever we say in this room doesn't have to leave this room, but my advice, marah...",
        "Marah: Fine, fine.",
        "Josh: No, marah, just listen to what he has to say.",
        "Marah: My dad did not shoot that woman.",
        "Jeffrey: Marah, you don't have to do this, do you hear me?",
        "Marah: I was there. I was there at the funhouse when the shots were fired.",
        "Josh: Marah, you weren't there.",
        "Marah: I didn't remember it at first because I was repressing the memory, but...",
        "Jeffrey: Marah. Marah, listen to me, darling, okay? Why don't you take some time with this, okay? Go home.",
        "Marah: No.",
        "Jeffrey: Go home and think about it....",
        "Marah: No.",
        "Jeffrey: ...And if there's still something you really have to tell me, then we can arrange an appointment for you to come down here and see me.",
        "Josh: Listen to what he's saying, marah.",
        "Marah: No. I...",
        "Josh: Just go...",
        "Marah: I'm going to tell you everything that happened.",
        "Josh: Okay. All right, all right, all right. You know what's happening here? Obviously, she's just saying whatever she has to say to help me. Right? And on top of that... on top of that, ed bauer, my understanding is he gave her some kind of medication after he broke the news to her, so this is the drugs talking. She can't tell fact from fantasy.",
        "Marah: No, after carrie shot buzz...",
        "Josh: You have to get her out of here right now! You know what happened because i told you what happened! There are witnesses to support what I've said to you. You have done your own investigating!",
        "Jeffrey: Calm down.",
        "Josh: And my prints were on the gun! Get her out right now!",
        "Marah: Dad! Dad! Please stop, okay? If I had any doubt coming in here that what I remembered was wrong, I don't have it anymore. I know that what I remember about that night is true. Otherwise you wouldn't be so desperate to keep me from talking. What happened that night was awful, but it did happen. My dad did not shoot carrie caruthers. I did. It was me.",
        "Josh: Marah, look at me, sweetheart. You didn't shoot anyone.",
        "Jeffrey: Josh...",
        "Josh: Don't say another word. Just go home.",
        "Jeffrey: Josh, why don't you sit down, josh?",
        "Marah: How can I go home and leave you here knowing that I'm the one who killed carrie?",
        "Josh: No. That's not so. It wasn't you. It wasn'T. (Sobbing)",
        "Marah: Dad. (Sobbing)",
        "Josh: Sweetheart, listen to me. Listen. You're just... you're not yourself right now, okay? I don't know if it's the drugs or the shock or what it is, but you're mixed up.",
        "Marah: No, I'm not.",
        "Josh: You have to listen to me. You have to be careful about what you say now and what you do now because it could change your life forever.",
        "Marah: No, I don't care, dad.",
        "Josh: I care. I care about you. I know what you're trying to do, but this isn't the way. Not with some made-up story.",
        "Marah: Dad, it's the truth. You know that it is.",
        "Josh: Marah, please. Please, please, just...",
        "Marah: Dad, no more secrets, okay? Haven't there been enough? Look at what it's done to your life already.",
        "Josh: I know. I know that. If I could... if I could go back and change things...",
        "Marah: You can'T. You can't go back now. You can only move forward, all right? Carrie waited 30 years for her revenge, and in a way she's been getting it all along. Look at the guilt that you've had to live with, the pain, every single day, year after year.",
        "Josh: I know. I know. It's been hell, but I...",
        "Marah: Maybe hell is what you get when you build your life on lies, and it has to stop. It's going to stop right now with me, okay?",
        "Josh: Marah, please. Walk away and let me do this...",
        "Marah: Dad.",
        "Josh: ...For you. For you. And for your mom and for shayne, for all of us. Let me do it. Please.",
        "Marah: No.",
        "Josh: Please.",
        "Marah: When I was little, you could make everything that was bad and scary go away, but I'm not a little girl anymore. You can't protect me from this, okay?",
        "Josh: Let me try.",
        "Marah: No. No, dad, you can'T. I have to take responsibility for what I did.",
        "Josh: Marah.",
        "Marah: Dad.",
        "Josh: Marah...",
        "Marah: Shh, okay? No more lies, okay? No more. (Sobbing)",
        "Alan: You want me to provide jeffrey o'neill with a bargaining chip.",
        "Gus: Well, if you make it worth the D.A.'S while, maybe you will get a deal.",
        "Alan: Gus, it sounds like a bribe to me.",
        "Gus: Come on, alan, please. It's a game. It's a game, you know it's a game. Just give them some spaulding information.",
        "Alan: What company business would possibly interest o'neill enough that he would reduce the charges I may face?",
        "Gus: The very same information that the feds are looking into.",
        "Alan: Which is?",
        "Gus: You realize if I tell you this, I'm going to compromise the entire investigation, okay, not to mention possibly wrecking my own career.",
        "Alan: Gus, why are you doing this?",
        "Gus: Because I'm an idiot, and I... I want to help you.",
        "Alan: All right. Tell me what they're looking for.",
        "Gus: They want information on antimonius.",
        "Alan: Antimonius? What on earth for?",
        "Gus: Well, I don't have all the information, alan, okay? I'm not privy to all of it, but what I do know is that a percentage of your drug is leaving the lab and it's going unaccounted for. People don'T... they don't know where it's going.",
        "Alan: Gus, we went over this at the last board meeting.",
        "Gus: No, no, no, no, no. We skipped over it at the last board meeting, okay, because of you and because of brad greene, who I can'T... I detest, by the way. No, this subject was not open for discussion.",
        "Alan: Are you suggesting that I'm covering something up?",
        "Gus: I am suggesting that you go to the D.A. Listen to me. You go to jeffrey o'neill, you tell him, \"mr. O'neill, it has come to my attention that the feds are interested in looking at my records, my pharmaceutical records at spaulding,\" and you would appreciate it if maybe he would be your go-between.",
        "Alan: Why would he get involved?",
        "Gus: Well, alan, because if the government gets what they want, then they're happy and if the government is happy, then the D.A. Is happy, and if the da is happy, well, then everybody's happy. Do you get my drift?",
        "Alan: And then he would be more inclined to be lenient with me, huh?",
        "Gus: Yes, exactly. I think it could work.",
        "Alan: Well, there's only one problem. You see, the material that the authorities will be going through at spaulding, they won't find anything, because there's nothing to find.",
        "Gus: Well, then what's the problem? I don't understand. It's a win-win situation, right? You let the feds in, they look at the pharmaceutical records, they find nothing, everything's cool.",
        "Alan: So you want me to allow the feds to go through the confidential information of spaulding enterprises?",
        "Gus: Alan, how many times do I have to say? Yes, yes! If cooperating with them makes your charges go away, then yes. Just do it. Open your books.",
        "Alan: No. Never. Oprah: Tom cruise on life",
        "Danny: Hey, have I told you how beautiful you look tonight?",
        "Michelle: Um... twice. Let's see, once when we were leaving the museum and then once again in the car.",
        "Danny: I thought so. I'm just checking. I'm glad you noticed.",
        "Michelle: I have been tense lately.",
        "Danny: Yeah, just a little. It's okay. I've been working really hard and that's not a great combination. It's all going to change tonight, okay?",
        "Michelle: I just feel really awful about marah, you know, and what her family's going through.",
        "Danny: I know. I know you do, but, honey, worrying is not going to help them and it's not going to help us. It's not. Let's just tonight do something for us.",
        "Michelle: Okay.",
        "Danny: Okay? All right. I'm going to go see if the room's ready. I have a little surprise for you. (Cell phone ringing)",
        "Danny: Hey, what are you doing?",
        "Michelle: I was just checking, you know, if marah got back and if reva had left a message.",
        "Danny: It's okay. I didn't expect you to just drop everything just like that. The room's not ready yet anyway, so...",
        "Michelle: You know, I keep thinking about josh in that dingy jail cell, and...",
        "Danny: Sweetie, I know, but by now, josh has probably made his statement and he's on his way home.",
        "Michelle: Right.",
        "Danny: From everything you told me, the shooting was self- defense.",
        "Michelle: Yeah.",
        "Danny: Right?",
        "Michelle: Yeah.",
        "Danny: So...",
        "Michelle: Meanwhile, marah's a wreck, and I just feel like i want to help her feel better, you know?",
        "Danny: I know. That's why I love you. You want to help everybody and you want to fix everything. But some things need to resolve themselves on their own schedule.",
        "Michelle: Mm-hmm. Tell me about it.",
        "Danny: And sometimes you need to let other people help you. Your husband, for example. Michelle, I know that something's been going on with you for a while now and you haven't wanted to tell me. It's okay. Well, it's not okay, actually. I wish that you would tell me but I'm not going to pry. I know you'll tell me when you're ready. So in the meantime, I want you to just relax and try to put all that stuff out of your head for tonight, at least for tonight. Please?",
        "Michelle: You're so sweet to me, danny.",
        "Danny: Well, I'm just selfish. I just want you back.",
        "Michelle: Well, I'm right here, I really am, and I want nothing more than to forget that these last few months ever happened. Okay?",
        "Alan: If I allow the federal government to go through the records of spaulding, the public will immediately think that we're being investigated and say, \"just another example of corporate greed.\" Our stocks will plummet, and even though they find nothing, the damage will already be done.",
        "Gus: You don't have to let the story be public, alan.",
        "Alan: Oh, please, gus. Don't be so naive. I mean, it will leak before the first vanload of agents hit the building. Things that go on at spaulding are very big news. Now, there's something else to consider here, not just the stock prizes and public relations.",
        "Gus: Go ahead. What is it? What?",
        "Alan: A lot of people depend on me: My children, my grandchildren, all of my employees. The decisions I make every day affect their lives. Now, is it right for me to put my company in jeopardy just because it would make things easier for me?",
        "Gus: So there's not going to be a deal with the D.A., Right?",
        "Alan: I take my responsibilities very seriously.",
        "Gus: Yeah, fine, whatever. Let me ask you this: Spaulding enterprises and all these people that you say depend on you, alan, how are they going to feel when they watch your butt being hauled off to vailsburg, huh? In a little orange jumpsuit for every camera crew in every time zone across america. What then? No, I know what they're going to say. They're going to go, \"hey, look at that! There goes a very responsible guy right there.\" Come on.",
        "Alan: I can't do it.",
        "Gus: What do you know about antimonius?",
        "Alan: The inquiry resumes.",
        "Gus: Oh, you know, the stock talk and people and public perceptions, it'S... it's a smoke screen, alan. I'm not an idiot, okay? I must be a very bad judge of character, because... especially with you, because first of all, I never would have had you involved with a murder or a death or a cover-up.",
        "Alan: It was an accident.",
        "Gus: Oh, just tell it to the judge. I... you're going to have to do that anyway, because if you don't give jeffrey o'neill what he wants, let me tell you what's going to happen to you. He's going to take you down for vehicular manslaughter, for obstruction of justice, for leaving a crime scene. He's stringing all that together, alan. You're going... you're looking at 20 years. Do you understand that?",
        "Alan: Hmm. Starting to sound like blackmail.",
        "Gus: No, alan. It's a deal. Do you remember back in the church you said that that's what you wanted? You wanted a deal, because you are the best deal-maker there is. Well, here's your deal. This is as good as it gets, okay, so make your choice. Just make your choice.",
        "Marah: Um, I guess we should start with what I was doing at the fairgrounds in the first place.",
        "Jeffrey: It's okay, marah. You don't have to give me a statement right now.",
        "Marah: She lured me there.",
        "Jeffrey: Caroline caruthers?",
        "Marah: She told me that she wanted to have a memorial for her niece maryanne and that after that, she would leave town forever.",
        "Jeffrey: A memorial at the fairgrounds?",
        "Marah: The place held a special meaning for her. It wasn't till later that i realized that her plan was to use me to hurt my dad.",
        "Jeffrey: When did you become aware of this plan?",
        "Marah: Too late. When things already started to go out of control. I entered the funhouse in time to see carrie shoot buzz on purpose. He was laying there, sitting on the ground with his arm, holding it, bleeding. I just... everything was going crazy. The lights, they were flashing so bright, and everything that i was seeing was doubled or tripled in those mirrors.",
        "Jeffrey: You were... you were disoriented, marah.",
        "Marah: I just... I started to freak out. I saw buzz's gun on the ground and... and I grabbed it. I didn't even do it... I didn't even know what I was doing. I didn't think about it, I just grabbed it.",
        "Jeffrey: You were scared, you were terrified. You were terrified at what this woman might do, and she had the gun in her hands, right? She had the gun in her hands at that point.",
        "Marah: The handle was shiny. After that, everything just started to go so fast.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, you were scared, marah. You were scared because she had already shot buzz, and you were scared because you were afraid she might shoot you or your father.",
        "Marah: She absolutely would have.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, she was unstable. She was deranged.",
        "Marah: Yeah, she was out of her mind. She had a gun in her hand. I had to do something.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay. Okay. That's enough.",
        "Marah: I saw her looking at my dad. He tried to take the gun out of her hands. I knew that she was going to hurt him.",
        "Jeffrey: Marah...",
        "Marah: And then I heard a bang. And I don't even know... I don't even think I knew where the sound was coming from. I just... I went numb. The next thing I knew, I saw my dad, and carrie was gone, and i asked him what happened, but... I shot her.",
        "Jeffrey: Marah.",
        "Marah: I shot her, and she fell through the trapdoor.",
        "Jeffrey: Marah...",
        "Marah: And I still had the gun in my hand.",
        "Jeffrey: Marah, that's enough. That's enough.",
        "Reva: Have you seen marah? I went by the museum and I... oh, god. She's here, isn't she?",
        "Reva: Please tell me that she didn'T...",
        "Jeffrey: Reva.",
        "Reva: No. No. What did she say?",
        "Jeffrey: I think you know.",
        "Reva: That she was there that night, at the fairgrounds.",
        "Jeffrey: Yes.",
        "Reva: That she had a gun in her hands and that she shot caroline caruthers.",
        "Jeffrey: She told you, too.",
        "Reva: No. I just... oh, god. This can't be happening.",
        "Jeffrey: I'm sorry.",
        "Reva: Jeffrey, this is where you set me down and you explain to me that we were both wrong-- marah and me both-- that no member of my family had anything to do with shooting that woman. Please convince me that this is not the way it is.",
        "Jeffrey: I wish I could.",
        "Gus: Baby? Baby, you home? How you doing, pop? You know, I was a very happy kid when I was with you. You know, you set the bar very high, maybe too high for my real father. I don't know. Maybe it's my fault. I've been trying too hard to find a man like you. I just wanted alan to be perfect. But even you weren't that, were you? I would settle for a decent, honorable version of alan spaulding, you know? That's fair, isn't it? This is all your fault, you know that, buddy? You know why? Because you always said, \"nicky, nicky, you got to look for the good in people, and you don't quit looking until you find it.\" And then, to add insult to injury, you raise me as a cop, to have cop-like instincts. Well, my cop-like instincts tell me that alan spaulding is a good man in his heart. I hope to god he doesn't prove me wrong. And then you also taught me to have faith, that everything would always be okay at the end of the day. That really didn't work out for you, did it? I want you to know something. I haven't given up. In fact, it's just the opposite. Every day, I try to get a little bit closer to being the man that you wanted me to be. Who knows? Maybe alan spaulding's trying to do the same. Yeah, and maybe I'll win the lottery.",
        "Gus: Let me ask you this: Spaulding enterprises and all these people that you say depend on you, alan, how are they going to feel when they watch your butt being hauled off to vailsburg, huh? In a little orange jumpsuit for every camera crew in every time zone across america. What then? Oh, I know what they're going to say. They'll go, \"hey, look at that! There goes a very responsible guy, right there.\"",
        "Alan: Responsible guy, huh? (Tires squealing) no!",
        "Danny: Okay. I'd like to make a little toast.",
        "Michelle: Let me make one first.",
        "Danny: Okay.",
        "Michelle: Okay? This is... this is going to be too us.",
        "Danny: To us.",
        "Michelle: No, wait, wait. I'm not finished.",
        "Danny: Oh. She's on a roll, fellas.",
        "Michelle: Yeah. Quiet. Um, this isn't going to come as news to you. You know how important I believe that family is.",
        "Danny: Mm-hmm.",
        "Michelle: I realize that every time I look at you and whenever I watch robbie sleeping. It makes me realize how lucky we are and how good our life really is, you know?",
        "Danny: I know.",
        "Michelle: And how quickly all that can change, you know? One mistake, one lie and it all can fall apart.",
        "Danny: Michelle...",
        "Michelle: And... I'm not finished. As precious as family is, we've got to protect it. And you do that for me. You protect me whenever I feel like I'm falling apart. You know where this is going. Um...",
        "Danny: (Laughs) no. I have no idea.",
        "Michelle: I just feel like i am the luckiest woman in the world when I'm with you, danny. To us.",
        "Danny: To us. I'm going to go find out what's taking so long with our room. I'll be back. Oh, I almost forgot. This came for you today at the house. Somebody slipped it under the door.",
        "Michelle: Oh, my god. She can't be alive.",
        "Reva: Okay. So what happens now?",
        "Jeffrey: Marah needs to come with me.",
        "Reva: Well, you know, I mean, she can stay here with us for just a bit.",
        "Marah: Mom? It's okay. It's okay.",
        "Reva: (Crying)",
        "Marah: All right. I love you. (Sobs)",
        "Josh: (Crying)",
        "Danny: Next on \"guiding light\":",
        "Alan: I told you then that one day all hell was going to break loose. Well, I want you to know, that day has come.",
        "Marah: What are you saying?",
        "Jeffrey: What happens in the next 72 hours could very well determine what happens to you for the rest of your life.",
        "Reva: I think maybe it's time that you told me the whole story."
