        "Harley: Two minutes.",

        "Harley: Confidential?",

        "Tammy: What about you? You were great.",
        "Joey: You think?",
        "Tammy: All edmund's coaching paid off. I wonder if he's enjoying the play.",
        "Sandy: Cast, cast? General note. We're a hit.",
        "Lizzie: Well, we owe it to the fabulous director. You're a star.",
        "Sandy: I wish I could take more credit.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, you're being modest.",
        "Sandy: Our two stars here deserve the praise tonight. So keep it up, you guys.",
        "Tammy: Did you see where my mom and edmund were sitting?",
        "Lizzie: Oh, joey, you know, there's this hook in the back. Could you fix it for me, please? Oh, thank you so much. You're such a hero.",
        "Joey: You're welcome. You're welcome, you're welcome.",
        "Alexandra: And you say it's taken care of? Yes, as long as it's in good hands. Very good. Bye.",

        "Edmund: There's my juliet.",
        "Bill: Eden? I got your food.",
        "Eden: Hey. I thought that we would watch a movie. I pay for all those channels, and we never watch any of them.",
        "Bill: Here's your food.",
        "Eden: You didn't get yourself anything?",
        "Bill: Huh? No. I'm just not hungry.",
        "Eden: Sweetie?",
        "Bill: Huh?",
        "Eden: You barely ate anything today. And why did you get this? Don't read that.",
        "Bill: To torture myself, that's why.",
        "Eden: Why?",
        "Bill: I'm a complete idiot.",
        "Eden: Why are you an idiot?",
        "Bill: I'll tell you why. For sticking my head out for danny santos, and for telling everyone I know to support his campaign. It's like I should have known better, but I just figured, you know what? This is michelle's husband, you know? A guy who wants to turn his life around.",
        "Eden: Honey, we all thought he was going legit.",
        "Bill: Yeah? Well, then, we're all idiots. I mean, let's face it. This guy used me to look good. I mean, that's all it was.",
        "Eden: You know, sometimes it's really hard to make your life better. Maybe danny just couldn't do it.",
        "Bill: Well, you know what? He's paying for it. And if michelle ever finds out the truth, I don't know what's going to happen. So...",
        "Eden: You think she's going to leave him? (Knocking on door)",
        "Bill: Oh, who could this be?",
        "Michelle: Hey.",
        "Bill: Michelle, what...",
        "Michelle: Hi. I'm glad you guys are here. I tried your cell phones. I keep getting voice mail.",
        "Bill: Ah, yeah. I had my phone turned off.",
        "Michelle: Can I come in?",
        "Bill: You know, we're just about to eat, so...",
        "Michelle: Well, I won't stay long. I just didn't get a chance to talk to you after the press conference yesterday.",
        "Bill: Oh, yeah. I had to take off. But besides, you defended your husband a lot better than i could have.",
        "Michelle: Well, you know, danny got a raw deal, and he really needs his friends by his side more than ever. And that's why I'm here. I need your help. This portion of \"guiding light\" is sponsored by flonase fluticasone propionate nasal spray.",
        "Bill: What exactly do you want me to do? It's over. We lost.",
        "Michelle: Well, yeah. The election may be over, but danny needs to get out there and show people that he's not a quitter. You know, he needs, like, a project, something worthwhile.",
        "Bill: Still has fifth street.",
        "Michelle: Oh, fifth street's not high profile enough. You know about creating an image. He needs something admirable to offset what they've accused him of.",
        "Eden: Like building homes for the homeless?",
        "Michelle: Exactly. Exactly. See, like, something like that could make a difference. Right, bill?",
        "Bill: Michelle, I don't know. You know, it'S...",
        "Michelle: Well, it could make more of a difference than being mayor. See, I think we need to sit down, we need to think this through, we need to brainstorm.",
        "Eden: I think bill has a new job, and I don't think it's a priority anymore.",
        "Bill: Danny doesn't know you're here, does he?",
        "Michelle: No.",
        "Bill: Why not?",
        "Michelle: You know danny. I mean, he doesn't want anyone's help, especially... he's not going to want help from me.",
        "Eden: You know, maybe danny doesn't want any help. Maybe he just needs time to recoup.",
        "Michelle: Well, that would make him look like he does have something to hide.",
        "Eden: Not necessarily. Sometimes you've just got to let the dust settle.",
        "Bill: Eden has a point.",
        "Michelle: Well, I disagree. I mean, I think he needs to prove to this town...",
        "Eden: Prove what?",
        "Michelle: That he didn't do anything wrong, eden. That he's changed.",
        "Eden: Michelle, I know you want to protect your husband and help him in any way you can, but maybe danny doesn't want any help.",
        "Michelle: Well, maybe he won't admit that he wants help, but this was a big defeat. I mean, not just because he lost the mayor's job, but he's lost everything that he's worked hard for-- his reputation.",
        "Eden: So what are you saying, he's going to give up?",
        "Michelle: Well, I hope not, but I'm going to stand by him, and he's going to need you guys there too.",
        "Bill: Michelle, there's nothing that we can...",
        "Michelle: No, look, look. You know how stubborn he is, and you know how much pride he has. He didn't even want me there at his concession speech.",
        "Bill: Well, doesn't that tell you something?",
        "Michelle: Like what? What's it supposed to tell me?",
        "Bill: Michelle, look. I am sorry. I am. And I wish you and danny the best, I really do. But right now I've got to just do my own thing.",
        "Michelle: So you're not going to help danny? What about me?",
        "Bill: I can'T.",
        "Frank: No, I got it. Doherty, you did a good job. I appreciate that. I'm on my way. Thanks. Oh, honey, I'm sorry.",
        "Marina: I can't believe you're ditching me after i cleared my schedule for you.",
        "Frank: Well, ditching is kind of a harsh word, and maybe not the right word. If this case really wasn't that important, I...",
        "Marina: Dad, no problem. Duty calls.",
        "Frank: Well, listen. I'll tell you what. Then at least I could drive you to the high school, and you can catch the second half of the play.",
        "Marina: Dad, no. I do not want to go see two and a half hours of high school shakespeare.",
        "Frank: Wow, look at that. You know, a year ago, you'd be...",
        "Marina: Yeah, well, a lot has happened in a year. I don't want to see it, dad. I can talk to shane at the after party. He can tell me all about it. He can tell me all about it. That's enough. Go to the station.",
        "Frank: Well, we have a little problem here, though. I drove you here. So how are you going to get to towers?",
        "Olivia: Hey. Father-daughter night out?",
        "Frank: Hello.",
        "Marina: It was.",
        "Olivia: Yeah?",
        "Frank: Unfortunately, I got called in at the station, so...",
        "Olivia: Yeah?",
        "Frank: Yeah.",
        "Olivia: Well, it happens. What about you? You feel like moonlighting? Cassie's at tammy's play, and marla called in sick, and i could use the help and the company. And I actually pay cash.",
        "Marina: I would love to.",
        "Frank: You know what? She'd love to help you out, olivia. And you don't even have to pay her. Just... you know, you're a friend of the family, so there it is. Good.",
        "Olivia: Free dinner.",
        "Marina: Hey, I work for food.",
        "Olivia: All right.",
        "Marina: You're on.",
        "Frank: Well, good.",
        "Marina: Bye, dad.",
        "Frank: I'll call you when I'm finished, and you two ladies behave yourselves.",
        "Olivia: Oh. Don't tell your father, but behaving is highly overrated.",
        "Alexandra: There. There. Better.",
        "Lizzie: Not so frumpy anymore?",
        "Alexandra: Oh, no.",
        "Lizzie: Okay. Thank you, aunt alex. So do you guys really think I'm doing okay?",
        "Beth: Oh, sweetie, you are fantastic. But I don't know why you should be surprised by that. You've acted onstage before.",
        "Alexandra: Actually, I think you should have the lead.",
        "Beth: Alex, tammy is doing a very nice job.",
        "Alexandra: Well, not according to this critic.",
        "Lizzie: Oh, you're just being biased.",
        "Cassie: Oh, gosh. You have been acting up a storm. Wonderful.",
        "Tammy: Really?",
        "Cassie: Yes. Absolutely amazing.",
        "Tammy: I forgot a line in the scene before last. Everything you taught me went right out of my head.",
        "Cassie: No one noticed that you forgot a line, believe me.",
        "Edmund: It doesn't matter. If it happens again, just focus on where you are. It'll come right back.",
        "Tammy: Will you come help me?",
        "Edmund: Sure, sure.",
        "Tammy: Okay.",
        "Edmund: Okay.",
        "Lizzie: You must be so proud of tammy.",
        "Cassie: She is doing a wonderful job. So are you. You're amazing.",
        "Lizzie: Thanks, but tammy's the star, so...",
        "Cassie: I'm so proud of her. I almost believe that she's really in love with romeo.",
        "Lizzie: Almost.",
        "Tammy: You're right. I just need to focus and think positively.",
        "Edmund: Good girl. Now, the important thing is, are you having fun?",
        "Tammy: Oh, a blast.",
        "Edmund: Good.",
        "Tammy: I could not have done any of this if it weren't for you.",
        "Edmund: Oh, tammy, I simply encouraged you. That was all.",
        "Tammy: Well, if you hadn't worked with me and believed in me...",
        "Edmund: You make it all very easy. And look at everything you've accomplished.",
        "Tammy: It is all because of you. I'm so glad you came into my life.",
        "Gus: Who was it?",
        "Harley: A messenger. You have a letter.",
        "Gus: From who?",
        "Harley: Spaulding.",
        "Gus: What's that?",
        "Harley: Spaulding. Do you want me to open it?",
        "Gus: What?",
        "Harley: Would you stop yelling? You're going to wake the kids.",
        "Gus: What, what, what? We're wasting time.",
        "Harley: Don't you want to know what this is?",
        "Gus: Not really. I mean, later. Come on.",
        "Harley: What if it's important?",
        "Gus: How important could it be? A messenger left it at the front door, right?",
        "Harley: It says, \"confidential.\"",
        "Gus: Well, open it if you want to. You're wasting time. Hurry up.",
        "Harley: No. I mean, hey, if you don't care, I don't care. Far be it from me. Who am I kidding? Gus, you'd better get down here.",
        "Gus: Whoa.",
        "Harley: I feel like I'm having deja vu all over again.",
        "Gus: I'm officially a trust fund baby.",
        "Harley: Great.",
        "Gus: But why? Why now? I don't get it.",
        "Harley: Alan. It's alan. And he's doing it again.",
        "Gus: You always think he's up to something. Why...",
        "Harley: Well, when isn't he?",
        "Gus: But he knows that money doesn't really work with me.",
        "Harley: But he thinks the gesture might.",
        "Gus: Oh, it might.",
        "Harley: See? See?",
        "Gus: All right. So he's up to something. Okay. So... but what is it?",
        "Harley: I don't know. What does that say again?",
        "Gus: \"My recent reminder of past mistakes has shown me how important it is to live in the present and to take care of my loved ones.\"",
        "Harley: See? See? He wants you to feel sorry for him.",
        "Gus: Well, I'm not doing that.",
        "Harley: Well, he thinks you could, though.",
        "Gus: What if he's being sincere? Did you ever think of that?",
        "Harley: No.",
        "Gus: What?",
        "Harley: Don't you see? This is a big deal. I mean, why isn't he handing this to you on a silver platter? Where's the big, grand gesture?",
        "Gus: Maybe he's just, like, you know, feeling... testing out the waters or something.",
        "Harley: Oh, please. This is not the alan spaulding i know. This is way too subtle.",
        "Gus: In his old age he's getting vulnerable, like a softie, okay? He'S... especially with all his exposed secrets. Now... you know.",
        "Harley: So what's your point?",
        "Gus: That's it. I can't find the point.",
        "Harley: What?",
        "Gus: The point. The point. I can't find the point. The decimal point. I can't find it.",
        "Harley: That was subtle. If you wanted to change the subject, you could just say so. The decimal point is right there at the end of all the zeros. See it?",
        "Gus: Whoa! That's a lot of money.",
        "Harley: You said that already.",
        "Gus: That's A... I could buy a '65 convertible mustang with that kind of money.",
        "Harley: You could buy a fleet of '65 convertible mustangs.",
        "Gus: A fleet, yeah.",
        "Harley: Do you want that?",
        "Gus: No.",
        "Harley: You're thinking of taking that money, aren't you?",
        "Olivia: So tell me first of all, why didn't you go to the play tonight?",
        "Marina: I'm kind of having a hard time bringing myself to go to the theater, olivia. It reminds me of what I wanted to do before everything kind of fell apart last year. Do you believe that I gave up theater at springfield high when I got involved with ben? It is crazy the things that you'll give up for the wrong guy.",
        "Olivia: Tell me about it.",
        "Marina: Maybe I will go back to theater. I don't know. We'll see. I guess I'm not too old, right?",
        "Olivia: Oh, come on. No, you're not too old. But I feel obliged as your life coach to tell you not to take too much time off from it before you try again. You know, staying away from something can keep you from jumping back in, you know? And if it doesn't work out, so what? Trying new things keeps life interesting.",
        "Marina: You're right. You are a good life coach.",
        "Olivia: Yes.",
        "Marina: You know, I do feel bad about not seeing tammy play juliet. Why aren't you there?",
        "Olivia: Because I'm here working. Because the spauldings made it clear that lizzie definitely doesn't need my support.",
        "Marina: Lizzie is a piece of work.",
        "Olivia: Mm-hmm.",
        "Marina: You know, the one good thing about this past year is that I have had nothing to do with her, and I would love to keep it that way. I was so relieved when she gave up on shayne.",
        "Olivia: Yeah? Has she been keeping her eye on anybody else?",
        "Marina: Like I said, I don't know what lizzie was up to. But I can tell you one thing-- i know that she probably has her eye on someone.",
        "Lizzie: So are you going to do it? Are you going to surprise tammy with a song tonight?",
        "Joey: That's the plan. Why?",
        "Lizzie: No, it's just really romantic.",
        "Joey: Well, I hope tammy thinks so. You know, I just want to make sure that she knows I'm still her romeo, even after the play is through.",
        "Lizzie: She's so lucky.",
        "Cassie: Debbie randolph is here.",
        "Tammy: Who?",
        "Cassie: You know, the \"springfield journal.\" \"Around the town with debbie randolph.\"",
        "Tammy: She's writing about a high school play?",
        "Cassie: Looks like it.",
        "Tammy: Why?",
        "Cassie: She's writing a review.",
        "Tammy: How do you know? Did you call her?",
        "Cassie: I might have. This is what she does. And she's nodding, and she's smiling, and she's loving it.",
        "Tammy: Oh, you are so cheesy.",
        "Cassie: Cheesy? You guys still use that word?",
        "Tammy: It's the only word i could think of. Mom, I can't believe you called the newspaper.",
        "Cassie: Why? Why can't I be a proud stage mom? I can just read it-- \"the beautiful and wonderful tammy winslow playing juliet. And joey lupo...\" who by the way is doing a fantastic job.",
        "Tammy: I know. Are you surprised he's more than a dumb jock?",
        "Cassie: I never said he was a dumb jock.",
        "Tammy: I know, but I could tell you thought it.",
        "Cassie: I did not think it. I like joey. Joey liked baseball. Joey loved baseball. But now I see he has other hidden talents, so...",
        "Tammy: He's doing pretty well. But then he's had a great teacher.",
        "Joey: Stab.",
        "Edmund: Why are you so nervous, joey? You've done this 100 times.",
        "Joey: No, I know. But this is much heavier than the sword we used in rehearsals. I mean, feel this, okay? That's some serious steel.",
        "Edmund: Is it really the sword that's making you nervous?",
        "Joey: Among other things.",
        "Edmund: All right. What are the other things?",
        "Joey: Have you ever done anything dumb to impress a girl?",
        "Edmund: Well, of course i have. I'm a man. What have you done?",
        "Joey: Hello! Look at me, okay? I'm in tights. I'm only doing this for tammy.",
        "Edmund: Well, joey, you've certainly tapped into some hidden talent.",
        "Joey: Oh, the first part was easy. All I had to do was pretend i was hot for her, which wasn't really pretending.",
        "Edmund: I'll pretend you didn't say that.",
        "Joey: Sorry. Look, I really care about her. The fact is I would do anything for her.",
        "Edmund: Yeah, I know what you mean.",
        "Tammy: You guys, kyle kost went home sick. We don't have a prince for the end of the show.",
        "Tammy: So much for that good review.",
        "Lizzie: We need sandy. Sandy?",
        "Joey: Talk about an actress. That girl is always on.",
        "Lizzie: What are we going to do?",
        "Tammy: Uncle edmund, you could do it.",
        "Edmund: Oh, no.",
        "Tammy: You know shakespeare better than anybody.",
        "Edmund: No, no, no. Are you out of your mind? No, he's the man who's going to save the day.",
        "Sandy: All right, kids. I heard my name. What's going on?",
        "Lizzie: Our prince went home sick.",
        "Sandy: You're kidding. No, you're not kidding. Prince edmund?",
        "Edmund: Sorry. Unfortunately, I've already declined the role, you know? And as you are the director, and technically the only other prince in the house, speak the speech, I pray you, trippingly on the tongue.",
        "Michelle: How can you turn your back on me?",
        "Bill: Michelle, I am not turning my back on you.",
        "Michelle: Oh, okay. Oh, I see. I see. Just danny. You guys worked so well together, bill. He needs you to stand by him right now.",
        "Bill: You know, michelle, i really doubt that danny wants be around right now.",
        "Michelle: Why would you say that?",
        "Eden: Michelle, you should talk to danny.",
        "Michelle: Why? Is there something here that i don't know? Bill...",
        "Bill: Michelle, look. I can't help him. I can'T. It's done, okay? It's over.",
        "Michelle: Wow. The first sign of trouble and you run away.",
        "Bill: Oh, my god. You think this is the first sign of trouble? Danny has so many skeletons in his closet I couldn't even keep the door closed, okay? I just had to turn my back. But this time, michelle, this time I can'T. I can'T. I can'T.",
        "Michelle: Oh, you think he's guilty.",
        "Bill: I did not say that.",
        "Michelle: Then why are you doing this? Why are you doing this to me?",
        "Bill: Look, this isn't about you.",
        "Michelle: Of course it's about me. Danny is my husband. What you do to him you do to me.",
        "Bill: Okay. All right, all right. Look. Look. I didn't want to say this, but the only reason I took on this campaign is because of you. I'm not a big fan of your husband's, or hadn't you noticed?",
        "Michelle: My husband is a good man.",
        "Bill: Oh, open your eyes, michelle. Danny is not who you think he is, and you'd better admit that to yourself before he really hurts you. Oprah: Radical medical makeovers righ &",
        "Michelle: What? What am I supposed to admit, that danny's a crook? Is that what you think?",
        "Bill: You need to go talk to danny.",
        "Michelle: I'm asking you.",
        "Bill: You go ask your husband!",
        "Eden: I think he's trying to tell you that this is no longer our fight, michelle. Michelle, look. He has done all that he could. If you want to mop up after your husband, fine. But he's finished. He has his own job to think about, all right? His own future.",
        "Bill: Eden, that's enough.",
        "Eden: What, it's not true?",
        "Bill: Would you please stop it? Please?",
        "Michelle: No, no. No, no. Eden's right. Wow. It's not your mess anymore. I don't even know why I bothered you.",
        "Bill: Michelle, don't just... you know, that wasn't really necessary.",
        "Eden: I'm sorry.",
        "Bill: Are you?",
        "Eden: Yes, I am.",
        "Bill: Then why didn't you stop? I mean, I asked you to stop.",
        "Eden: You know, if I was too hard on her it is because you are not going to tell her the truth.",
        "Bill: It's not my place. Let danny break her heart. God knows he's done it a hundred times before.",
        "Eden: You know, I realize that you and michelle have been friends since you were in diapers. And you know what? I will be more careful about what I say. But you know what? I will not overstep...",
        "Bill: Don't do this. Please don't do this.",
        "Eden: Don't want?",
        "Bill: Don't make an issue out of something that's nothing. And that's what you do.",
        "Eden: Fine! I am going to get some air.",
        "Sandy: I think you've got it.",
        "Joey: Think I got it, too. Boy, am I going to be glad when this is over. Never, ever again, man.",
        "Sandy: I thought you were having a grand time.",
        "Joey: It's for tammy's benefit. Forget I said anything.",
        "Sandy: No, that's cool. I won't say anything.",
        "Joey: What about you? You've got to be ready for this to be over. I mean, stepping halfway through for old man clemenza? I bet you're not even getting paid.",
        "Sandy: Oh, I'm getting paid, a little.",
        "Joey: Well, that's good, right?",
        "Sandy: Yeah.",
        "Joey: You're not ready for this to be over, are you?",
        "Sandy: It's been fun for me, you know? Kept me busy. But hey, nothing lasts forever. You break a leg, man.",
        "Lizzie: What, dressed I your clothes in doubt again? I must need wake you, lady. Lady? Lady? Alas, alas, help! Help! My lady is dead. Oh, well-a-day ever I was born. My lord, my lady...",
        "Joey: Lizzie, that was awesome. That was your big moment.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, my big moment.",
        "Joey: Hey, what's wrong?",
        "Lizzie: Nothing.",
        "Joey: You sure?",
        "Lizzie: I just wish my dad was here.",
        "Joey: Sorry.",
        "Gus: Okay, I'm not going to keep the money.",
        "Harley: Are you sure? Because you're the one talking about all those zeroes and fleets of mustangs.",
        "Gus: No, you said fleet. I said one. Just one is...",
        "Harley: Gus, what are you going to do?",
        "Gus: I'm going to give back the money. I'm going to give back the money. I'm giving it... I'm giving it back, okay? Are you satisfied now?",
        "Harley: Hey, it doesn't matter if I am satisfied.",
        "Gus: Really?",
        "Harley: It's your life. It's your money.",
        "Gus: No, this is his money.",
        "Harley: Mm-hmm.",
        "Gus: It's not... no. We don't need the money. It'S... unless, of course, you want the money.",
        "Harley: No. Unless, of course, you want the money.",
        "Gus: No. Not... we're happy in our misery right here. I'm going to call him. I'll call him and say, \"hey, thanks,\" you know? \"Thanks, but no thanks,\" I'll tell him.",
        "Harley: Good.",
        "Gus: Yeah. I mean, but you sure you don't want the money?",
        "Harley: What?",
        "Gus: I'm just saying, you know, that's a lot of money. With that kind of money you could buy a really big wedding someday. It's a lot. Weddings cost a lot of money. I don't know if you've been thinking about it, that it's expensive.",
        "Harley: I just have a vague idea of how much they cost.",
        "Gus: You know, we have a lot of bills. Do you know that we have a leaky roof right now as we speak? It's leaking...",
        "Harley: Gus...",
        "Gus: ...All over the place.",
        "Harley: I don't care about the leaky roof. I really don'T. Because we don't need this money.",
        "Gus: We don't need it. We don't need it. We've got everything we need right here under this leaky roof, right? Everything we can... mmm. Want to go upstairs.",
        "Harley: I want to go upstairs.",
        "Gus: So we're on the same page. (Doorbell rings)",
        "Harley: I cannot believe this.",
        "Gus: Listen, I'll get it. Maybe we'll have a little better luck this time.",
        "Harley: Just make whoever it is go away.",
        "Gus: I got it.",
        "Eden: Nicky...",
        "Gus: What's up, eden.",
        "Eden: This is a bad time. I should have called.",
        "Harley: Hi, eden. Come on in.",
        "Eden: You sure?",
        "Gus: Come on in.",
        "Harley: Yeah. I was on my way upstairs to check on the kids anyway. Why don't you guys talk?",
        "Gus: Yeah, all right.",
        "Eden: I'm sorry, nicky.",
        "Gus: No, no, no. It's fine, it's fine. Don't worry about it. What's up?",
        "Eden: How did you figure out all this relationship stuff? I need advice.",
        "Gus: From me?",
        "Eden: Don't laugh. I'm not even married yet. I'm losing bill.",
        "Gus: Honey, you're not losing bill.",
        "Eden: How do you know? I haven't even told you what happened yet.",
        "Gus: Well, because I saw the way he looked at you at dinner the other night.",
        "Eden: He didn't look at me that way tonight.",
        "Gus: All right. What happened?",
        "Eden: I don't know what happened. I mean, I think it happened. I don't know. Maybe it was all in my head, what happened.",
        "Gus: It probably was all in your head. You're a little wacky. But just fill me in, because I'm clueless here. Help me.",
        "Eden: Okay. Bill and danny had a falling out after the election.",
        "Gus: Mm-hmm. Right. Well, that's understandable. I thought danny was going to turn it around, but obviously i was wrong.",
        "Eden: We all were.",
        "Gus: Mm-hmm. But what's that got to do with you?",
        "Eden: Michelle came over earlier and she asked for bill's support.",
        "Gus: Yeah, and?",
        "Eden: Well, bill is fed up with danny.",
        "Gus: What's this got to do...",
        "Eden: What if michelle gets fed up with danny?",
        "Gus: This is not your problem.",
        "Eden: Bill and michelle, they've been friends forever, and they've tried to be lovers before, and...",
        "Gus: Honey, bill loves you.",
        "Eden: I am no michelle bauer.",
        "Gus: No, honey, no. Come on. You don't want to be michelle bauer. Look, no offense. She's a very sweet girl and everything, right? But can you imagine two michelle bauers in this town? No. No, thank you.",
        "Eden: Bill is the best thing that ever happened to me. And what if he wakes up one morning and he realizes that i am a mistake, and he wants to be with michelle?",
        "Gus: No. Michelle and bill... look at... first of all, if that was going to happen, that would have happened a long time ago. Out of your control, okay? And danny and michelle, they're like krazy glue. You can't pull those two apart.",
        "Eden: I'm not so sure.",
        "Gus: Honey, he loves you. He wants you. He wants to marry you. Can't you get that?",
        "Eden: Nicky, why am I so insecure? I ask myself ten times a day what the hell is he doing with me.",
        "Gus: Well, that's silly. It's silly to ask yourself that even one time. Look at yourself. Look. Look at you. You are a beautiful girl. You're beautiful, and you're sexy, and you're sassy.",
        "Eden: Oh, so sassy.",
        "Gus: Very sassy. But you're also very sweet deep down inside. A little bit wacky, but sweet. You are. And you know what? You don't want to be michelle bauer, okay? You don'T... she's nice. You are even better than that. And look, I can see that little girl inside you, and that's exactly what bill sees.",
        "Eden: You're going to make me cry.",
        "Gus: That's what bill sees. You're not going to cry. You're going to go home, you're going to work this all out with bill. He's going to be right by your side, all day long, okay?",
        "Eden: Okay.",
        "Gus: All right. That a girl.",
        "Harley: Okay, those boys are still asleep.",
        "Gus: Yeah.",
        "Harley: Do you want something to drink or something?",
        "Eden: No, thank you. We're finished.",
        "Harley: Oh, please, you don't have to leave on my account. If you need to talk...",
        "Eden: No, no, no, no, no. We're good. Thank you.",
        "Gus: Any time. Any time. All right. All right.",
        "Eden: Okay. I am so sorry I interrupted, really.",
        "Harley: You didn't interrupt. You didn'T. Hey, I've got a brother too, and he's the one I always go to, so I understand.",
        "Eden: We're really lucky. Thank you.",
        "Harley: Sure. Time check.",
        "Gus: Time check. Okay, we've got exactly 17 minutes.",
        "Harley: 47 minutes!",
        "Gus: 47?",

        "Olivia: Yeah.",
        "Frank: Hmm. That's great, girls.",
        "Marina: We're kidding. We're just having fun.",
        "Frank: Well, good, good. Thank god. You deserve to have some fun, sweetie. You really do. Olivia, you know, I didn't get to talk to you very much. I heard that you've moved into the house of spaulding.",
        "Olivia: I did.",
        "Frank: How's that going?",
        "Olivia: Fine, great.",

        "Olivia: Yeah. She is. I can handle the spauldings. I can. I can do anything, if I have to, in order to take care of my daughter.",
        "Frank: Good. Good for you. I'd just like to put this out there. If you ever need a break or just a place to hang out, the cooper house is always open to you and emma.",
        "Olivia: I have not forgotten movie night. I'm going to take you up on it.",
        "Frank: Well, good.",
        "Olivia: I'm going to eat a lot of your food. Thank you. And thank you for keeping me company. It was fun. And remember, what did we say?",
        "Marina: Being well behaved is highly overrated.",
        "Olivia: That's my girl. She learns.",
        "Frank: What? Okay. Well, that's good. Let's take you to towers, okay?",
        "Marina: All right.",
        "Frank: See you. Take care.",
        "Bill: Good work, danny santos. You really fooled me, huh? Think you're so smart. Well, here's to the sneak and the liar. I can hear you know-- \"good old bill. He's going to forget everything he knew about me and help me become mayor.\" Well, never again. Never again.",

        "Tammy: O happy dagger, this is thy sheath. There rest and let me die.",
        "Sandy: A glooming peace this morning with it brings. The sun for sorrow will not show his head. Go hence to have more talk of these sad things. Some shall be pardoned, and some punished. For never was a story of more woe than this of juliet and her romeo. (Applause)",
        "Tammy: Oh, that was great! We did it!",
