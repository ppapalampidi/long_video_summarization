        "Liam lashes out at Steffy and says he was not gone that long. She fires back that he went to Australia and when he came back that he had said he was done with her so what was she to believe. He says but he never stopped loving her and he never will, so tell that to her new husband. He demands that she tell him his name. Zende drops by some proofs and runs into Nicole. He mentions the interns date night. She is sure taking Sasha will be more like it. She is not being a saint here and there are times she wishes Sasha had not come to Los Angeles and maybe things would be different now. Sasha repeats what Viv just asked her if she could pull back until Nicole has the baby and then if they wanted to they could both compete for Zende. Viv reminds her that she and Nicole have been best friends her entire life so this is painful and not good for Nicole or the baby. Sasha pulls away when Viv mentions being a member of the family. She does not think she has to be grateful for that but then perhaps she should repay her. As she is about to unload on her Julius walks in and tells Sasha to be careful with the tone she speaks to his wife. Sasha says all of this is better for Nicole but not her. And she is just supposed to accept that. She did not take Zende away from Nicole. Nicole gave him up the second she decided to be Maya's surrogate. Nicole made her decision and Zende made his. And believe it or not he wants to be with Sasha and she would be a fool to walk away from him. Steffy says she doesn't blame Liam now but she needs him to understand how things were and why she got on with her life. He bellows okay, he gets it. She was upset and confused and this guy was there for her and he thanks him for that but now he is back ..and he loves her and he is ready to get married and yes now he wants to know who it is as he is not going to let this person stand in his way. He demands to know who it is. He is floored when Steffy says it is Wyatt. Liam says he came home the second he realized who he was. She says Wyatt was there for her and was supportive and they did not know all of this about where Liam really was all that time. He left all those messages and she thought that was what he wanted. He tells her Quinn tricked them. He can't get over that it is with his brother. Viv tells Nicole that she is so sorry. Sasha has always been nice and polite and now she seems so angry. Julius adds his two cents that you cannot talk to that girl about anything. Sasha is getting ready for her shoot and is happy to see Zende come in and she parades around for him. He doesn't seem too thrilled and changes the subject and asks her why did she tell Nicole that he loved Sasha. She must have done that to hurt Nicole. She says they made love and it was not just physical and he knew how important it was to her. And he had said he meant it. He says yes, it is not just physical with him. He is not that kind of guy. She says he is so incredible, the kind of guy she has searched for her entire life. And since she grew up without a father she wasn't sure that kind of guy existed. Her mom taught her not to get hurt and to find a guy she could trust and depend on. And up until Zende, she had not thought that man existed. She says she is sorry if she said those words but she thought he meant it and no man has ever said those words to her before.",
        "Wyatt asks Bill if Liam's doctor says he will be okay. Bill retorts that yes physically but no telling what those weeks with his nutjob of a mother did to him, her torture may be more than a few bumps on the head. Wyatt says he understands and he cannot condone anything his mom did. But when Liam finds out about Steffy and him being married he will hate Quinn even more. Bill says maybe but Quinn did not force Steffy to put on that ring. They both know that is not how Liam will see it and hope he can handle this. Steffy says she is so sorry. She wishes she could explain how it was for them at the end. But he just took off and did not want her in his life. She did not think she would ever see him again, so it was over. He muses when has it ever been over for them? He loves her still and she must have known something was wrong .and all those memories, how could she forget? They had to mean something. None of this should have happened. She says but it did and they can't just go back and fix everything. He says she can, she can undo it. She replies that he is home and safe and that is all that matters. He says this is not home, it never will be without her here. And she can not want to be with his brother now that she knows the truth. She says she did not marry Wyatt because she was angry with Liam. He simply wasn't here, he wasn't anywhere. He argues that every single memory he ever had was wiped out except for her. He knew there was someone he had to get back to, more important than his name. He accuses her of not waiting long enough. Surely she had to have known something was wrong. He is shocked that she thinks he would have broken up with her by a text. She says she waited and did not give up on him, but ..he says okay then he will not give up on them either. He tells her they were manipulated and her marriage to Wyatt was a mistake. And despite everything he is back and he is not going to give up on her. He grabs her and plants a big kiss on her."

        "Steffy: This time. You kept leaving. You went to Australia, and when you came back, you changed. You said you were done with me.",
        "Liam: I -- I never stopped loving you, though. And I never will. I never will. So, why don't you tell that to your new husband? Tell him that. Who is he? Who is he? What's his name? Tell me!",
        "Bill: I don't want to hear that. Just take care of it and get back to me.",
        "Wyatt: You hear anything?",
        "Bill: No. That was the office. Steffy hasn't called you?",
        "Wyatt: No, not yet.",
        "Bill: It's a pretty tough job, telling Liam you're married.",
        "Wyatt: It's tougher probably to hear it.",
        "Bill: It's gonna be rough on all of you. But you're Spencers now. You'll get through it.",
        "Zende: Hey.",
        "Nicole: Hey.",
        "Zende: Proofs.",
        "Nicole: Thanks.",
        "Zende: I heard some of the interns talking about going out after work.",
        "Nicole: Are you and Sasha going?",
        "Zende: No. What about you?",
        "Nicole: [Chuckles] Pregnant lady up in the club? Nah.",
        "Zende: We used to have a lot of fun with those guys.",
        "Nicole: Yeah. We did. You should go, though. I'm sure that Sasha will be a big hit with them.",
        "Vivienne: I've never asked you for anything, Sasha. I'm asking for Nicole.",
        "Sasha: You want me to back away from Zende?",
        "Vivienne: Until Nicole has Maya's baby. This pregnancy is difficult enough, but seeing you and Zende together -- it's not good for Nicole or the baby.",
        "Sasha: No one's throwing it in her face, aunt Viv.",
        "Vivienne: It's painful! You and Nicole have been best friends your entire life. We've always treated you like you were part of the family.",
        "Sasha: And I'm supposed to be grateful to you for that? I should thank you for all the years you had to put up with me in your house? I should do something to repay you! 'Cause I think I already have. Do you want me to tell you exactly how I've repaid you?",
        "Julius: Hey! You watch your tone when you speak to my wife!",
        "Nicole: You and Sasha are still seeing each other? Well, did you ask her about what she said to me?",
        "Zende: I'm sure it was just a misunderstanding.",
        "Nicole: Yeah. She thinks you love her, Zende. If that's not how you feel, she deserves to know.",
        "Zende: We're just getting to know each other.",
        "Nicole: Then tell her that. You were always honest with me, so... you should be with her, too. Maybe that's weird advice coming from me.",
        "Zende: It's the right thing to do.",
        "Nicole: Don't make me out to be a saint. Sometimes I wish that Sasha hadn't come to L.A. Things might be different if she hadn't.",
        "Vivienne: I'm asking you to do what's right.",
        "Sasha: What's right for Nicole, not me. You want to talk about what's right?",
        "Vivienne: You are her best friend.",
        "Sasha: I didn't steal her boyfriend. Nicole gave him up the second she decided to become Maya's surrogate. Now, if you don't mind, I have a photo shoot to finish getting ready for.",
        "Julius: Viv...let's go.",
        "Vivienne: Julius...",
        "Julius: Listen, trying to talk to her is a waste of time.",
        "Sasha: Look, Nicole made her decision, and Zende made his. Believe it or not, he wants to be with me. And I would be a fool to walk away from him.",
        "Bill: It's gonna be a shock. Liam still loves her.",
        "Wyatt: He doesn't even remember leaving her, dad.",
        "Bill: [Sighs] You know, maybe they would have worked things out if your crazy mother hadn't...locked him away in her house.",
        "Liam: You know what? It doesn't even matter. It doesn't matter who he is. I don't care, because you belong with me.",
        "Steffy: I thought you left me. You packed your bags, you quit your job, and I waited for you. But you never came home. And I'm not saying this to make you feel bad. I'm not saying this 'cause I'm blaming you, because I don't. I just need you to understand how things were.",
        "Liam: Fine. Fine. You were upset and confused, and this guy was there for you, and, hey, I even thank him for that. I really do. But I'm back now. I am here, and I love you, and I'm ready to get married, and I'm not gonna let this -- this -- this person stand in my -- I take it back. I do want to know who he is. Who is this guy? What's his name?",
        "Steffy: [Sighs] Wyatt.",
        "Liam: Wyatt? You married my brother?",
        "Vivienne: I don't know what got in to that girl. I mean, she seems angry.",
        "Nicole: Really?",
        "Vivienne: Yeah. I mean... she wasn't like that. Sasha has always been so polite and respectful to me. That's why I thought I could discuss this.",
        "Julius: Well, listen, I don't even know what she's so angry about.",
        "Vivienne: Well, I asked her to step back from Zende until the baby was born. You know, I mean, I didn't mean to insult her, but she took it that way.",
        "Julius: Nobody can talk to that girl about anything anymore.",
        "Vivienne: Well, I just asked her to think about Nicole and the baby, you know -- I mean, how you feel when you see her and Zende together.",
        "Nicole: She didn't listen?",
        "Vivienne: No, honey. I am so sorry. Ohh.",
        "Sasha: There you are! Hi. What do you think? It's pretty hot, right? Sexy, sophisticated, touch of fun? The lingerie isn't bad, either. Ha ha! Hey, is something wrong?",
        "Zende: Um, there's something I need to ask you.",
        "Sasha: Okay.",
        "Zende: I had a conversation with Nicole earlier. Sasha... why did you tell Nicole that I said I loved you?",
        "Wyatt: [Sighs]",
        "Bill: I support my family. I won't put one son over another. I feel for what Liam's going through, but you and Steffy got married. That's a done deal.",
        "Wyatt: [Scoffs]",
        "Steffy: It was like you said. Wyatt was there for me. He was a friend, and he was concerned. He told you not to leave me. And I thought you were gonna come home.",
        "Liam: I did. The second I realized who I was, I did.",
        "Steffy: I didn't know what was going on with you. No one did. Your behavior made no sense.",
        "Liam: Then shouldn't that have told you something?",
        "Steffy: I thought that's what you wanted.",
        "Liam: It wasn't.",
        "Steffy: But you left those messages. You told me to leave you alone.",
        "Liam: Not me, Steffy. Quinn tricked us.",
        "Steffy: I was hurt! Wyatt was there for me! And he was supportive. [Voice breaking] I needed that.",
        "Liam: My brother.",
        "Nicole: Sasha may be feeling a little defensive. Her relationship with Zende isn't as superserious as she would like everyone to believe.",
        "Vivienne: What do you mean?",
        "Nicole: She told me that Zende was in love with her, but he never said that.",
        "Vivienne: Now, why would she do that?",
        "Nicole: I don't know. But he's not happy about it.",
        "Julius: Sasha's words may be coming back to haunt her, huh?",
        "Zende: You had to know that would hurt Nicole. Is that why you said it?",
        "Sasha: No. I -- wait. Zende, I'm confused. Are you upset with me?",
        "Zende: I'm just trying to figure out why you told Nicole that I said I loved you.",
        "Sasha: Are you saying that you don't?",
        "Zende: There must be a misunderstanding.",
        "Sasha: But you said we made love and that it wasn't just physical between us, and I told you how important that was to me. And you said you meant it. So...",
        "Zende: I did. It isn't just physical with me. I'm not that kind of guy.",
        "Sasha: Look, Zende, you are incredible. You are truly such a good man. You're actually -- you're the kind of guy that I have searched for my entire life. Growing up without a father, I never even really thought that existed. My mom always taught me to be careful so that I don't get my heart broken like she did. She taught me to find a guy that I could trust, one that I could depend on, and up until you, I never even thought that man existed. And then I met you. I used to just think that love was a fantasy that was in movies and books. And then you said the words. And so I'm so sorry, but if I misunderstood anything, it's only because no man has ever said that to me before.",
        "Wyatt: The doctors checked him out. You said he's gonna be okay, right?",
        "Bill: Physically. But all those weeks alone with your nut-job mother -- that kind of torture can be more detrimental than a few bumps on the head.",
        "Wyatt: Hey, I can't defend anything my mom did. It was criminal, pathologically.",
        "Bill: Par for the course, Wyatt.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah, but this is different. When Steffy tells Liam that we're married, he's gonna hate mom even more.",
        "Bill: Your mother didn't force Steffy to put on that ring.",
        "Wyatt: That's not how Liam's gonna see it!",
        "Bill: He's lucky to be getting his memory back, but nothing is as he remembers it.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Bill: The state that he's in... I just hope he can handle it.",
        "Steffy: I am so sorry, Liam.",
        "Liam: This is hurting you, too. I can see it.",
        "Steffy: You don't remember the way things were with us. And I wish I could tell you, but... I don't know... because you didn't tell me and you wouldn't talk to me. [Crying] You just -- ohh. You just took off. I honestly -- I didn't think I would ever see you again.",
        "Liam: So you moved on?",
        "Steffy: Yeah. It was over.",
        "Liam: When has it ever been over between us? You knew something was wrong. You knew how much I love you. You knew everything that we've been through together, Steffy. I lost those memories. You didn't. Don't they mean something to you?",
        "Steffy: You know they do.",
        "Liam: Then...how could you do it?",
        "Steffy: I-I told you what happened, Liam.",
        "Liam: Yeah?! Well, it shouldn't have happened! It shouldn't have happened! None of this should have happened!",
        "Steffy: You can't think that way, 'cause it's not gonna fix anything.",
        "Liam: But you can. You can undo it, Steffy.",
        "Steffy: Liam, you're home now. You're safe. That's all that matter.",
        "Liam: You think this is home to me? This is not home to me unless you're here. Do you understand? You c-- listen. You can't want to be with my brother -- not now, not right now, not now that you know the truth. You can't stay married to him, Steffy.",
        "Sasha: You know this isn't all we are, Zende. But I got to admit that this part is pretty fun.",
        "[Chuckles]",
        "Zende: Well, I never said there was anything wrong with it.",
        "Sasha: Okay. Well, I just wasn't sure. I know I got ahead of myself, but I swear I never meant to hurt anybody. I don't -- I don't want to blow this.",
        "Zende: You haven't. We're fine.",
        "Sasha: Well, I think we can do a lot better than just \"fine.\"",
        "Zende: Wait. Aren't you forgetting something?",
        "Sasha: Oh, the photo shoot!",
        "Zende: Yeah.",
        "Sasha: [Laughs]",
        "Zende: Photo shoot.",
        "Sasha: See? That's what you do to me. I'm gonna go finish getting touched up, okay?",
        "Zende: All right.",
        "Nicole: Zende's feelings about the baby haven't changed. Even if he wasn't with Sasha, he couldn't be with me.",
        "Vivienne: Oh, sweetheart.",
        "Nicole: I still feel good about giving Maya this gift. It hasn't been easy. But it's what's right.",
        "Vivienne: Well, you're the only person who can make that decision. And all we can do is love and support you. That's what parents do.",
        "Bill: You and Steffy are married. That's a fact.",
        "Wyatt: That doesn't mean that Liam has to accept it.",
        "Bill: Well, if anyone can bring him around, Steffy can. Those two have always been able to communicate.",
        "Wyatt: [Scoffs]",
        "Steffy: Liam, think about what you're asking.",
        "Liam: Are you saying no?",
        "Steffy: I didn't marry Wyatt because I'm angry with you.",
        "Liam: Would you have married him if I had been here?",
        "Steffy: You weren't here. You weren't anywhere.",
        "Liam: I-I was close enough to feel you, Steffy. Even when it didn't make sense to me, I knew that there was someplace else I was supposed to be. That's how much a part of me you are. You -- you -- you are more important, more essential to me, than my own name. Do you understand that my whole life was wiped out -- every single memory, every one, erased, except for you. Couldn't you feel that? Couldn't you tell how much I needed you then?",
        "Steffy: I don't know. I don't know.",
        "Liam: Did Wyatt tell you to forget about me?",
        "Steffy: No. Wyatt was helping me.",
        "Liam: Yeah, and his mother was helping him by keeping me away from you.",
        "Steffy: Will you stop?",
        "Liam: How long did Wyatt wait until proposing? How long did he wait?",
        "Steffy: Wyatt saved you! He brought you home!",
        "Liam: Yeah, and you married him without even talking to me.",
        "Steffy: [Crying] I tried talking to you! I texted you. You told me that it was over.",
        "Liam: You think I would end it in a text?",
        "Steffy: I waited for you. I didn't give up on us.",
        "Liam: Okay. Then I won't do that, either. We were manipulated, Steffy. Your wedding was a mistake. You know it and I know it, and despite every horrible thing that has happened, I am back and I am not giving up on you again."
