    "Transcript": [
        "Ray: Ready to go?",
        "Danny: Yeah.",
        "Marina: Why don't you go? You're family. Say good-bye.",
        "Rick: Hi, michelle. Thought you could use some company.",
        "Michelle: Hey.",
        "Rick: So, what are you doing out here?",
        "Michelle: Just thinking, you know? Thinking about tony. How he would still be here if he hadn't loved me.",
        "Bill: You know, I happen to know for a fact that tony didn't regret one minute with you.",
        "Michelle: I've hurt so many people, you know? People that I really love. ( Sighs ) I'm just tired of causing so much pain.",
        "Alexandra: Alan, it's time to start worrying about gus.",
        "Alan: Is it?",
        "Alexandra: How can you be so cavalier about this whole thing? I mean, you've already lost one son, alan.",
        "Alan: He is a grown man. He's capable of taking care of himself.",
        "Alexandra: Then I...",
        "Alan: I'm sure gus is probably out chasing some lead that's going to clear harley.",
        "Alexandra: Then why isn't he answering his telephone? Where is he?",
        "Alan: I do not know. But I did hear a little clue, something about a woman's perfume.",
        "Alexandra: Well, that makes some silly kind of sense. I went to see harley and she practically gave me a sniff test-- something about jasmine. What do you think they know? Do you think this means anything?",
        "Alan: No, it means nothing. They're just grasping for straws.",
        "Alexandra: Unless, of course, it does.",
        "Alan: \"Does,\" meaning what?",
        "Alexandra: What if it means that phillip's killer-- the real killer-- is loose? Hmm? And maybe living right under our own roof?",
        "Olivia: Hi. Could I get a cup of coffee to go, please?",
        "Gus: You picked the wrong day to quit smoking, mister. Yeah. You should quit smoking cigarettes. No, you're not a quitter. Don't ever be a quitter. Someone let me out of here!",
        "Mallet: So, what's up? You change your mind? You got a new lead you want me to track down? Harley?",
        "Harley: We need to talk.",
        "Mallet: Okay, I'm listening.",
        "Harley: I realize that things have been tense with us, and i wanted to say I'm sorry.",
        "Mallet: That's funny. For a second there, it sounded like you were apologizing.",
        "Harley: I am apologizing. Hey, it's been hard for me, seeing you here like this. I had imagined it differently over the years.",
        "Mallet: Is that right?",
        "Harley: Well, I wasn't in prison, for one. But I've been harsh, okay? You've just... you're trying to tell me, and I realize I have unresolved issues.",
        "Mallet: Issues.",
        "Harley: I was wrong, and you were right.",
        "Mallet: Wow. About?",
        "Harley: About us.",
        "Bill: It was an accident, michelle. You didn't push him.",
        "Michelle: Yeah, well, I might as well have. You know, tony wanted to spend the rest of his life with me and I...",
        "Bill: And you, you realized that you loved danny.",
        "Michelle: I loved tony, too.",
        "Bill: I know.",
        "Michelle: And I would have done anything, I would have done anything not to hurt him. I just couldn't lie to him.",
        "Bill: No. Come on.",
        "Rick: Michelle, tony... tony made his own choices. You can't blame yourself.",
        "Danny: Hey.",
        "Rick: Father, I'm so sorry about your loss.",
        "Ray: Yeah. Thank you.",
        "Rick: I'm sorry.",
        "Michelle: Ray, can we... can we do this?",
        "Ray: Yeah.",
        "Rick: Yeah. Listen, we'll see you around, okay?",
        "Michelle: Okay.",
        "Danny: How do you want to do this, ray?",
        "Ray: I'M... I'm not up for this right now. Just talk to him, danny. Talk to him. He's listening. He's out there.",
        "Danny: Um... I don'T... tony, I... I don't know how we ended up here. I don't know why you felt like everything you did was never good enough for me. I know that when you came to town, I was really hard on you and made you fight for everything, your ideas and your independence. ( Sighs ) but you didn't fight for your life. You gave it up for me.",
        "Ray: He loved you, danny.",
        "Danny: ( Sighs ) good-bye, tony.",
        "Michelle: You, uh... tony, at the worst time in my life, you made me feel loved and safe. And you protected me from myself, you know, until I could accept who I was, who I am. I just hope that you felt safe with me. I really loved him. I really did, and... you know? You know, I hurt him. And now he's gone. ( Sighs )",
        "Ray: I loved my little brother, michelle. My whole life I just tried to guide him, help him find his way to happiness. Although I didn't realize it at first, that way was through you. It was your love that made tony the man he wanted to be.",
        "Harley: You know me. You still know me, after all these years. I knew it the minute you walked into my cell.",
        "Mallet: Uh, you didn't really act like it.",
        "Harley: Well, you know I have trouble trusting and forgiving.",
        "Mallet: I wasn't really expecting this.",
        "Harley: Well, you've been trying to get me to trust you.",
        "Mallet: Yeah, and you've made it very clear that you never will, so what's changed here?",
        "Harley: Maybe nothing's changed. In eight years. Maybe that's the point.",
        "Mallet: So you're saying that you can trust me now?",
        "Harley: Yes.",
        "Mallet: All right, so I've got to know: Why?",
        "Harley: I just realized how alone I am in here, except for you. And how lucky I am to be here with you.",
        "Mallet: Yeah. Yeah, I'm so glad to hear you say that. ( Alarm buzzing ) um, I... I... I've got to send you back. Let me get a guard, and I'll send you back.",
        "Harley: Don'T. No, no, no. Don't send me back. Not yet.",
        "Alexandra: Olivia! Oh!",
        "Olivia: Alex.",
        "Alexandra: Hello, darling. ( Sniffs )",
        "Olivia: What are you doing?",
        "Alexandra: Oh, I'm saying hello.",
        "Olivia: By sniffing me like a poodle?",
        "Alexandra: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. That's shampoo, isn't it? It smells wonderful. It's not perfume?",
        "Olivia: Are you all right?",
        "Alexandra: Oh, yes, yes. Actually, I'm very happy. I want to congratulate you on the deal you made-- you know, helped alan with the pierce deal and everything.",
        "Olivia: No. Well, no, we weren't working together on the pierce deal.",
        "Alexandra: No, but you beat out lewis construction, you know? And that's a coup. Everybody's happy about that. How's bill taking it?",
        "Olivia: Not so well.",
        "Alexandra: Oh. Well, I can imagine.",
        "Olivia: Is there something you want?",
        "Alexandra: Well, actually, i was thinking about what you said to us the other day, about the only reason gus has moved into the house is to be able to point the finger at one of us for phillip's murder. And, well, I agree with you.",
        "Olivia: Thanks. Speaking of junior, I haven't seen him around. Where is he?",
        "Alexandra: Well, he happens to be missing.",
        "Alan: Alex, will you stop being so dramatic?",
        "Olivia: Where is he?",
        "Alan: Gus? Well, he's where he needs to be.",
        "Ray: So give us grace to accept the sufferings of the present day, confident that a glory shall be revealed. Amen. In the name of the father, the son, and the holy spirit. I'm going to head back and make the arrangements.",
        "Michelle: Thank you, ray. Thank you.",
        "Danny: I should probably go with him.",
        "Michelle: Can you stay for a minute?",
        "Danny: Okay.",
        "Michelle: It's so overgrown down there, you can't even tell where our lot was.",
        "Danny: It's over there. And the view from the bedroom would have faced this way.",
        "Michelle: You still remember, huh?",
        "Danny: Yeah.",
        "Michelle: ( Sighs ) yeah, you know, me too. That's kind of the problem, remembering the life you forgot and the dreams that you had. It's kind of like putting on your old favorite coat, and it doesn't really fit anymore.",
        "Danny: What are you saying?",
        "Alan: I'd like some more wine, please.",
        "Alexandra: Alan, will you stop playing this stupid game and just tell us, where is gus?",
        "Alan: My lips are sealed.",
        "Alexandra: You know that is a four-year-old's answer?",
        "Alan: He told me not to spread around his business, and I'm, as you know, a man of my word.",
        "Olivia: We're not going to read his diary.",
        "Alan: Well, if you two must know, he had another attack with his bleeding ulcer, more serious than last time. I told him if he didn't get away, I mean, it was going to kill him.",
        "Alexandra: Get away where?",
        "Alan: I gave him the name of a medical institute that we use overseas.",
        "Alexandra: Okay, alan. Why the secrecy? If you're really trying to help his health, for heaven's sakes, you would...",
        "Alan: Well, I know this may sound a little crazy, but he feels that by going away, he may lure out the \"real killer\" from hiding.",
        "Olivia: Mystery solved.",
        "Alexandra: Well, wasn't that simple? Oh, there's one bitter, handsome husband at 9:00. So what was the name of that clinic you sent gus to?",
        "Alan: Will you stop hounding me for the name?",
        "Olivia: Here. Good timing.",
        "Bill: Yeah?",
        "Olivia: Yeah.",
        "Bill: What's this?",
        "Olivia: A gift, from me to you.",
        "Gus: There's got to be a way out.",
        "Harley: You've been fighting so hard for me. I bet you never thought you'd have to save some of that energy for yourself.",
        "Mallet: Harley, it's almost lights-out. I should send you back to your floor.",
        "Harley: Is that what you want?",
        "Mallet: It'S... it's my job.",
        "Harley: What if we're not finished here yet?",
        "Mallet: I thought you said everything you have to say.",
        "Harley: Like I told you before, you know me. You know me better than anyone. I don't always like that. ( Laughs ) but it's true, as true as it was the day I left you.",
        "Mallet: A lot has changed.",
        "Harley: Really? I thought you just told my dad that I hadn't changed a bit.",
        "Mallet: Well, in some ways you haven'T. You can still spit nails.",
        "Harley: Only when I need to.",
        "Mallet: Which you've done every second since you've entered this prison.",
        "Harley: Hey, I hold a grudge.",
        "Mallet: No, you don't say. ( Laughter )",
        "Harley: See, we had something special. And being with you, it's hard for me, because it reminds me of a time that I stopped thinking about, that I made myself stop thinking about. My mind... well, it's stuck.",
        "Mallet: Stuck? On what?",
        "Harley: On us, on the way we used to be. Coming up on \"guiding light\"...",
        "Mallet: Wow. Your lips are still the same. Your mouth still fits okay. You still smell the same.",
        "Harley: Good.",
        "Olivia: But the truth is, is that it's all kind of meaningless without you. And I think that maybe your life is a little empty without me. Oprah: Nate makes over a famous hollywood bachelor's pad.",
        "Mallet: Wow. Wow. That was almost... ( laughter ) that was almost everything i remember.",
        "Harley: Almost?",
        "Mallet: Yeah. Your lips are still the same. Your mouth still fits okay. You still smell the same.",
        "Harley: Good.",
        "Mallet: ( Laughs ) nice try.",
        "Harley: ( Laughs ) what?",
        "Mallet: It may have been a long time since I've had a real kiss from you. That wasn't a real kiss.",
        "Harley: I don't know what you are talking about. ( Laughs )",
        "Mallet: Oh, miss harley cooper, you are trying to con me, simple as that. I think you also forget that I've seen you work undercover. You know, turning on the charm when you thought it would help with a suspect? You're good, really good. But not when you're working someone who knows the difference. So, what do you want?",
        "Harley: Out.",
        "Mallet: Out?",
        "Harley: Out. To be outside, just for a day. Maybe two.",
        "Mallet: Well, no problem. Why didn't you just ask? Should I have the concierge pull around the state-issued limo? Because you'll want to ride in style while you're on holiday from jail.",
        "Harley: Could you stop being sarcastic long enough to listen to me? Please? This is about gus, okay? I begged him to stop working on my case, but he hasn'T. And my father just told me he's disappeared. No one can find him.",
        "Mallet: Oh, but you can?",
        "Harley: Not from in here, i can'T. Please, please let me go.",
        "Mallet: Don't worry about gus. He's taken care of.",
        "Gus: You look good.",
        "Harley: You okay?",
        "Gus: I've had better days.",
        "Harley: The government spent a lot of money training you for the fbi. Put it to use. You can do things your captors would never dream of.",
        "Gus: I could listen for them to come through the door. Then I could get something ready, like a weapon.",
        "Harley: All this time, you've been absorbing clues others would miss. Go piece together those clues. You'll figure out who they are.",
        "Gus: I'll figure it out.",
        "Harley: Now we're cooking. You thought you needed me. Look how well you're doing on your own.",
        "Gus: Your being here makes all the difference in the world. I just... I want you to be out of prison, because I miss you, baby.",
        "Harley: I miss you. We'll find our way back to each other. We both know that.",
        "Gus: I know. I know, but I'm losing it. I'm going crazy.",
        "Alan: You don't need to concern yourself, alexandra.",
        "Alexandra: I don't like it when you tell me what I need and what I don't need.",
        "Bill: Okay, now, what am i supposed to do with alan's briefcase?",
        "Olivia: It's what's inside the briefcase.",
        "Bill: So, what? I open it up, an alarm goes off?",
        "Olivia: Come on. There are no tricks, okay? KaI promise you.",
        "Bill: A can of worms explode in my face? Is that what's going to happen here?",
        "Olivia: Just this, all right? It's details on alan's next land deal. I saw him put the file in the briefcase before we left the office.",
        "Bill: Corporate espionage. How romantic.",
        "Olivia: Listen to me. I did not sleep with you to get the pierce deal. I did not. I slept with you because I'm a little nutty and a little slutty. That sounded better in my head.",
        "Bill: I'm sure.",
        "Olivia: And because I love you, and you love me right back. \"More than ever,\" I believe you told your mother.",
        "Bill: What do you want me to do?",
        "Olivia: Well, I know what i don't want. I don't want to ever put business above you again. And I want another chance.",
        "Alexandra: Okay, what's the name and number of the clinic you sent gus to, because I need to speak to him.",
        "Alan: What for?",
        "Alexandra: ( Laughs ) because I want to keep him in the loop about olivia. As a matter of fact, we should be keeping a closer eye on her, too. ( Cell phone ringing )",
        "Alan: Oh, if you'll excuse me, I have some business to attend to.",
        "Alexandra: Really. What kind?",
        "Alan: Nothing that concerns you. What took you so long to get back to me?",
        "Sebastian: Alan. I wish you were here with me right now. The females in olivia's bar are off the chain.",
        "Alan: Well, don't bother to buy a round of drinks yet, because I have an assignment for you.",
        "Sebastian: Oh, that's fine. I like to keep busy. It keeps me out of trouble.",
        "Alan: Good.",
        "Michelle: If I stay here, you know, things are only going to become more complicated. And I can't even begin to deal with the fact that tony gave his life for us. His death is going to hang over us for a really long time. You know that.",
        "Danny: Where do you want to go?",
        "Michelle: Well, my dad's in south africa now. He's in cape town. He's at the university, and he's got a place that's, you know, big enough for us.",
        "Danny: You want to take robbie with you?",
        "Michelle: I'm not taking him away from you. I just wanted him to come for a few weeks. You know, I've missed him so much, and I just... I just really want to spend some time with him without tony's death hovering over us. Please? Please don't fight me on this.",
        "Danny: Michelle, why would i fight you on it? He needs you. He needs you to be the mother he remembers.",
        "Michelle: I'm so sorry.",
        "Danny: Yeah, me too.",
        "Michelle: I'm just really sorry for everything that you lost.",
        "Danny: Michelle, we are where we are.",
        "Michelle: Well, I better go get robbie packed.",
        "Danny: Why? When are you leaving? Are you leaving tonight?",
        "Michelle: Yeah.",
        "Danny: Oh, okay. Well, will you have him call me so that I can talk to him? I need to talk to him, say good- bye to him.",
        "Michelle: Yes. Yes, of course. Of course. I really, really hope that you're going to be happy.",
        "Danny: Michelle? I want you to be happy, too. That is all I've ever wanted.",
        "Marina: I thought the ceremony for tony was really beautiful.",
        "Danny: Marina, you didn't have to stand over there the entire time.",
        "Marina: I didn't want to be in the way.",
        "Danny: You wouldn't have been.",
        "Marina: Michelle said a lot of things.",
        "Danny: Yes, she needs to get away, and I'm going to miss robbie like crazy, but it'll be good for him to be with his mother and grandfather for a couple weeks. And...",
        "Marina: Danny, this isn't going to work.",
        "Danny: Marina, if you're bailing on me now...",
        "Marina: No. No. The way you said good-bye to michelle, you're standing here full of regret, wondering what you could have said. You both had a million questions to ask each other, half a billion things you wanted to say.",
        "Danny: No. It's all been said.",
        "Marina: No. Danny, it hasn'T. She ran off, and you weren't ready. Go to the airport. Say good-bye to robbie, and say whatever you need to say to michelle.",
        "Danny: What are you doing?",
        "Marina: I'm sending you off into the arms of your one true love, the mother of your child. Danny, the truth is, I am never going to have you unless you let go of her. This may be the craziest thing I've ever done, but it's definitely the right thing. Go to the airport.",
        "Danny: I think you're beautiful. I'll call you later.",
        "Olivia: I told you before that I need you. I do. See, sometimes I just... I think that success in business is going to make everything better for me. You know, it's going to take away all my doubts and all my fears. But the truth is, is that it's all kind of meaningless without you, and I think that maybe your life is a little empty without me.",
        "Bill: It's a little empty. But olivia, I'm not ready to get back in this thing both feet first, you know?",
        "Olivia: I'll take whatever body parts I can get.",
        "Bill: Well, you know, maybe if we just take our time, you know? A date here and a date there, and just see how it goes. We could...",
        "Olivia: Okay.",
        "Bill: Yeah.",
        "Olivia: Although I think i know where it's going to end up: The same place it did the other night. You want to have another look at the file before I go?",
        "Bill: Um, no. I think I got a good look.",
        "Olivia: Okay. Good luck.",
        "Alan: Well, I think you did an outstanding job on that other little problem we had.",
        "Sebastian: Alan, I'm a man of tremendous talent and unshakable will. I did not come back from the dead to play it safe. I can handle whatever you throw at me.",
        "Alan: Well, listen carefully, and I'll tell you exactly what i want you to do.",
        "Harley: What did you mean when you said \"gus was taken care of\"?",
        "Mallet: Gus is a spaulding, so I'm sure if he's in trouble, alan's going to take care of him.",
        "Harley: I don't believe you.",
        "Mallet: Do I look like i care? Look, I'm willing to help you with your life, but I'm not going to help you with your life on the outside. You have no life on the outside. Your life is inside these four walls, and the sooner you accept that, the better your life's going to be. Oh, and by the way, the next time you try and seduce me, i might just decide to let you.",
        "Harley: Get off me. Listen, if you aren't going to help me by letting me out, at least do this for me. Give this note to alan. Please, let him know that gus is in trouble. If I ever meant anything to you...",
        "Mallet: Guard.",
        "Guard: Yes, sir, warden?",
        "Mallet: Cooper missed head count. Can you take her back to the common room?",
        "Guard: Let's go.",
        "Harley: Thank you.",
        "Distorted voice: Ready to talk, mr. Aitoro? Let's play a game. If you get the right answers, you get out. Sound simple enough?",
        "Michelle: Okay, it's about that time. We've got to get on that plane, huh?",
        "Rick: Yeah. We know how much you love airplanes. Right, robbie? I'm going to miss you so much. Last chance. Are you sure?",
        "Michelle: Yeah.",
        "Robbie: Daddy, daddy!",
        "Danny: Hey, buddy. Boy, you don't think I would let you go on a trip without giving you a big hug first, huh? What kind of cuckoo do you think I am? So are you ready to go to africa? And I'll see you in a couple weeks. And hey, you know what it's going to be time for when you get back? Baseball. Give me a kiss. Lucky kiss. Can I talk to you for a minute?",
        "Rick: Hey, let's go look at the airplanes, robbie, okay? Come here. We'll be by the window.",
