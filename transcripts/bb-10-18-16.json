        "Pam tells Eric that their prayers were answered and it is good to have him back. Ridge says RJ is there and they all love Eric and he also is glad he is back. Quinn tells Wyatt that Eric is better but the family is still treating her like a piranha. She just wishes they could see how much they love each other. Steffy and Liam hug and he asks if he can't convince her that last night was the last night they will be apart. She says in deference to Wyatt she thinks they have to do this. She just wishes all would see how dangerous Quinn is \u0096 dangerous enough that she ended her marriage because of her. She stayed in it as long as she could. She does feel guilty though for giving up. Liam says she had to do this to be safe. And Wyatt knows what Quinn is capable of yet it is his choice to support her and not Steffy. Quinn tells Wyatt that she cannot believe she has control over everything. Wyatt warns her not to lord that over everyone. Brooke tells Eric that it is good to see his eyes open again and it will soon be like old times. Ridge agrees; he is the glue that holds this family together. RJ tells his granddad he has moved back to L.A. so hurry up and get better so they can go surfing. Pam says they prayed everyday and Brooke says they are so grateful that he fought to come back to them. They leave his bedside while the nurse comes in. But Eric tells Ridge to stay. Ridge sits on his bed and says he does not know what Quinn told him but he did what he did to protect him and he hopes Eric knows that.",
        "Wyatt tells Quinn that Steffy left him so excuse him for not exactly listening to her little \"family does not like me\" problems now. So what is good for her now with Eric sucks for him now. She says it breaks her heart that Steffy won't accept their marriage but Wyatt does not have to let her walk away. Steffy tells Liam that she just wishes the circumstances were different, so do not leave anything for her in the fridge as she does not know how long this divorce will take but she wants to do this the proper way and not spend the night here until it is over. He says he knows she has a history with Wyatt but all things within reason. They have waited so long that all he wants to do is but he gives in and says this will give them something else to look forward to. Ridge laments to Eric that he just naturally thought Eric would name him POA and he panicked when he realized he didn't and it was Quinn. He says he is just glad that Eric is back and putting words together so they can talk about this another time. Quinn says she is being optimistic here. Steffy has not tried to get to know her, her actions are pure. Life is precious and that is what she is doing. She is never going to let anything or anyone come between her and her husband again. As Ridge tries to speak he tells Eric that this is not probably the best time but Eric seems to want to talk. He has drawn up new papers naming him as POA; this is all to protect him and the family's legacy. No matter how Eric feels about Quinn, she cannot handle that. It has to be Ridge."

        "Ridge: Hey, Dad. We came for a visit. Your family's here.",
        "Rick: No, no, don't bother getting up. I came to you.",
        "[Light laughter]",
        "Pam: It is so great having you back with us, Eric. Our prayers were answered.",
        "[Monitor beeping]",
        "Eric: Br-Brooke.",
        "Brooke: Is it possible you could be even more handsome?",
        "Eric: [Coughing]",
        "Ridge: All right. Take it easy. R.J.'s here.",
        "R.J.: Hey, Granddad. You gave us a scare. You know that? I love you.",
        "Pam: We all love you, Eric.",
        "Ridge: It's unbelievable. You made it. You're back.",
        "Quinn: Thanks for coming, sweetheart.",
        "Wyatt: What's up?",
        "Quinn: The family is upstairs visiting Eric, and I just wanted to give them some space.",
        "Wyatt: Oh. That's big of you.",
        "Quinn: Well, I thought things would get better, but no, they're still treating me like I'm a pariah.",
        "Wyatt: And that surprises you?",
        "Quinn: No! But I just -- I wish they could see how much I love Eric, that I'm 100% committed. This isn't an act. I'm not trying to con anyone. You believe me, don't you?",
        "Wyatt: I guess so, yeah.",
        "Quinn: Well, if Steffy could believe me, then maybe your marriage wouldn't be in jeopardy.",
        "Steffy: [Sighs]",
        "[Waves crashing]",
        "Steffy: I can tell you missed me last night.",
        "Liam: Yeah. Yeah, I did. Are you sure that I can't convince you last night was, in fact, our last night apart?",
        "Steffy: [Sighs]",
        "Liam: I miss sharing a bed with you, and everything that goes with it.",
        "Steffy: My boxes are all packed and ready to go, but I just... Wyatt.",
        "Liam: Yeah.",
        "Steffy: And everything that he's going through, you know, ending my marriage and he's dealing with his mom, and there's a lot of things.",
        "Liam: I take it Quinn is still holding court over at Eric's.",
        "Steffy: Yeah. Unfortunately. Some of my family are with him right now.",
        "Liam: Well, maybe, uh, when Eric recovers a little more, he'll realize what he's gotten himself into and he'll... get himself out of it.",
        "Steffy: I just wish Wyatt could understand how dangerous Quinn is. I mean, God, dangerous enough for me to end my marriage. I tried to stay in my marriage as long as I could.",
        "Liam: I admire that about you.",
        "Steffy: Then why do I feel so bad? I just feel, like, guilty for giving up.",
        "Liam: Listen, I don't like that Wyatt's in pain. I really don't. But you got to look out for yourself and your family, and none of them are safe with Quinn around.",
        "Steffy: You know, Wyatt's more a victim in this than anyone.",
        "Liam: Yeah, you're not wrong.",
        "Steffy: She's never gonna let him go. And now her claws are in my grandfather.",
        "Quinn: Steffy can't stand me.",
        "Wyatt: What makes you think that?",
        "Quinn: And ridge is still so angry. He despises me. The whole family does.",
        "Wyatt: Mom, accept it. Unless you leave Eric, this whole thing will never get any better.",
        "Quinn: But Eric and I have something special. I-I-I wouldn't have put your marriage at risk otherwise.",
        "Wyatt: I'm not so sure about that, but okay.",
        "Quinn: Oh, come on. You can't hate me that much. You're the one who told me that ridge lied about having power of attorney.",
        "Wyatt: Don't take advantage. Don't lord it over everybody's heads.",
        "Quinn: I'm not. I'm not. I just -- I... I can't believe that I have control over everything, that Eric left me in control.",
        "Dr. Andrews: Vitals look good. Blood pressure's a little high, but that's normal.",
        "Rick: Will he make a full recovery?",
        "Dr. Andrews: It's hard to say for certain. We'll keep monitoring him, continue his medication, but I'm pleased with his progress. Mr. Forrester, big hurdle regaining consciousness a few days ago. Now, it's gonna take some time and hard work, but you are recovering very nicely.",
        "Brooke: Thank you for coming to give us an update, doctor.",
        "Dr. Andrews: Oh, it's my pleasure. I'll be in touch.",
        "[Monitor beeping]",
        "Brooke: Oh, Eric. We were so worried about you.",
        "Pam: To see those gorgeous eyes of yours again, be able to talk to you just like old times.",
        "Zende: It's so good to see you, Granddad.",
        "Ridge: Hey. We all love you very much. You're the glue that holds this family together. We're grateful you're here.",
        "Rick: Maya sends her love, Dad. She's at home with your granddaughter, Lizzy. And Lizzy can't wait to play airplane with you again. So keep on getting better, 'cause I know we haven't shown you much lately, but we need you around here.",
        "R.J.: Hey, Granddad, I moved back to L.A., so I'm gonna see a lot more of you. And rest up, 'cause when you get out of this bed, we're going surfing, all right?",
        "[Light laughter]",
        "Zende: Can I get in on that?",
        "Eric: You...better.",
        "Zende: Deal. Only if you don't do this again, all right? We need you to stick around. Who else is gonna lead us in Christmas carols? Who's gonna keep us on key?",
        "[Light laughter]",
        "Zende: I'm proud of your strength. You're one badass granddude.",
        "Nicole: And we're so happy you're doing better.",
        "Pam: I don't need to tell you how grateful I am that you're on the mend, Eric. I am one happy mess. I prayed for you every single day. Now look at you. Smiling up at us.",
        "Brooke: We're truly thankful that you fought so hard to stay with us, determined to get better. And you will. Every day with your family around you.",
        "Ridge: Yes. Speedy recovery. You've always been there for us. Now we're gonna be there for you, get you back on your feet. Excuse me. Mr. Forrester really needs to get his rest now.",
        "Brooke: Oh, yes. Okay.",
        "Ridge: All right, come on.",
        "Brooke: Get some sleep.",
        "Pam: We love you.",
        "R.J.: Check in on you later, all right?",
        "Eric: Ridge.",
        "Ridge: Yeah?",
        "Eric: S-stay.",
        "Quinn: It's an honor that Eric entrusted me with his power of attorney. I mean, it's a real show of faith. I'm sure ridge is gonna do everything he can to change that, try to get me out of here. But I don't think Eric can be swayed. I don't think that's gonna happen. Wyatt? Are you even listening to me?",
        "Wyatt: [Sighs] Mom, Steffy left me, and she's probably going back to Liam, so excuse me if I really don't care about your problems right now.",
        "Steffy: Just imagine being Quinn's son, growing up with that woman. It's like, Wyatt had so many stories.",
        "Liam: Yeah, but according to Quinn, she's a totally different person now that she's with Eric. Complete transformation overnight. Miraculous.",
        "Steffy: Yeah, right. Wyatt had to put up with that lunatic of a mother for his entire life, and yeah, he tried to love her like any son should. He's just...hoping to see the good in her and hoping that she would change.",
        "Liam: [Scoffs] She never has. She never will. But that's -- [Sighs] That's the thing. Wyatt is a grown man now. He knows exactly who Quinn is. He knows exactly what she's capable of. And still he chose to keep her in his life.",
        "Steffy: He's her son. He feels -- he feels an obligation, Liam.",
        "Liam: I get that. It's still a choice.",
        "Steffy: I guess.",
        "Liam: I am so glad you're not in that situation anymore.",
        "Brooke: Thank you for letting us see Eric.",
        "Quinn: Of course. How is he doing?",
        "Rick: He was able to say a few words, talk with his family.",
        "Quinn: Oh, good. I'm glad you got to have that with him. Where's ridge?",
        "Brooke: Still upstairs.",
        "Rick: Dad said he wanted to speak with him alone.",
        "[Monitor beeping]",
        "Ridge: All right, Dad. I don't know what Quinn's told you. But just to be clear, I did what I did to protect you. I hope you can see that.",
        "Wyatt: I'm -- I'm happy that Eric is recovering, and I know how excited you are about your new life. But mine's ruined because of you.",
        "Quinn: No, it's not ruined. It sounds terrible when you say it like that.",
        "Wyatt: It is terrible, Mom! Everything was fine! I was happily married until you hooked up with Eric! Against everyone's wishes, you moved in here, and then you married Eric, sort of.",
        "Quinn: I married Eric.",
        "Wyatt: Whatever! Congratulations on being the new Forrester matriarch. Great for you. Sucks for me.",
        "Quinn: I know. I am sorry.",
        "Wyatt: I just want you to think about how many people your marriage is affecting. You're the only one who wants this to happen.",
        "Quinn: And Eric. Eric also wants this to happen! Don't we deserve a chance to be together?",
        "Wyatt: [Chuckles]",
        "Quinn: Look, it breaks my heart that Steffy wants to end your marriage. But you don't have to accept it, Wyatt. You don't have to let her walk away.",
        "Liam: You know, actually, it's kind of a good thing you're not moving in just yet.",
        "Steffy: It's good?",
        "Liam: Yeah. Whoa, hold on. [Chuckling] I'm -- I'm just saying. I have some stuff I could do, like I-I get to finish the upstairs bathroom and I can load the fridge with all your favorite junk food.",
        "Steffy: [Chuckles]",
        "Liam: Dust off your old tennis racket.",
        "Steffy: You kept that?",
        "Liam: Yeah. Steffy, I kept a whole box of stuff that you forgot to pack last time. Kind of figured you wouldn't be staying away forever.",
        "Steffy: [Sighs] I just wish the circumstances were different.",
        "Liam: Me, too.",
        "Steffy: And, you know, don't -- don't put anything in the fridge that might go bad anytime soon, because I don't know how long this divorce is gonna take.",
        "Liam: W-- do you think Wyatt will contest it?",
        "Steffy: No, no, no. But I don't -- [Chuckles] I know he's not happy about it, especially that I'm coming back to you.",
        "Liam: Yeah. Although he can't be that surprised.",
        "Steffy: Well, still, I don't -- I don't want to rub it in, okay? I just... I want to do this respectfully, the proper way. And hey. You know that I want to -- I want to stay here and I want to move in with you and I want to spend the night with you. You know that. But not yet. Not when I'm still married to Wyatt.",
        "[Monitor beeping]",
        "Ridge: [Sighs] I -- [Sighs] I just assumed that you'd given me power of attorney. Just thought you'd put my name on that piece of paper, you know? And when I realized that you hadn't...I panicked. I didn't trust Quinn's intentions. I still don't. That's -- that's why I didn't show up at the wedding. Man, if I thought for one second that you'd end up like this, in this condition, I'm -- I... [Sighs] I'm sorry. I take full responsibility for that. But let's talk about this later, can we? 'Cause look, you're getting better. You're awake. You're -- you're putting words together, and I'm -- I'm... I'm just happy you're here.",
        "Eric: Are... you?",
        "Liam: I know, I know. It's complicated, and you and Wyatt have a lot of history. And I agree that we should be considerate. Within reason.",
        "Steffy: It's a lot to ask, but I just -- I need to be sensitive and deal with this the best way I can.",
        "Liam: I know. I get that. But we were apart for so long, and...now we're together. And all I want to do is pick you up and throw you over my shoulder and take you into the bedroom.",
        "Steffy: Okay, don't. Don't tempt me, please.",
        "Liam: I would never tempt you. Why would I --",
        "Steffy: Liam, stop. [Laughs]",
        "Liam: Okay, all right. Okay, you're right. No, you're right.",
        "Steffy: Oh, I am right.",
        "Liam: You're totally right.",
        "Steffy: I'm right.",
        "Liam: It's just, uh -- [Laughs] It's one more thing to look forward to. We can finally get into bed together.",
        "Steffy: Can you just stop saying that?",
        "Liam: What? The word \"bed\"?",
        "Steffy: Yes. Stop.",
        "Liam: You mean like when we go to sleep and then we wake up in the morning in bed? Like that?",
        "Steffy: I can't wait.",
        "Liam: Bed.",
        "Steffy: [Laughs]",
        "Wyatt: The last time we talked, you said, \"let Steffy have Liam,\" did you not?",
        "Quinn: Well, it was bravado, honey. I was trying to make you feel better.",
        "Wyatt: [Scoffs] Great.",
        "Quinn: But I do still think there's a chance. Just don't -- don't let Steffy go!",
        "Wyatt: Are you nuts? Are you nuts? Everything that you have done has completely sabotaged my relationship.",
        "Quinn: No, look, Eric is coming back to us, thank God. This family's on the verge of a major change.",
        "Wyatt: Seriously, Mom? Be realistic here.",
        "Quinn: I am being optimistic here. I know Steffy hates me, but she just hasn't seen how I've changed.",
        "Wyatt: You know, you keep saying that, but she won't. It's done. She wants nothing to do with your or with me.",
        "Quinn: Because she hasn't tried to get to know the real me. And once she does, she'll realize that I'm good for Eric, because I am, and that -- and that my intentions are pure, because they are. You've seen it. Why shouldn't Steffy?",
        "Wyatt: 'Cause I'm your son. I'm kind of stuck with you.",
        "Quinn: Yeah, well, she's his granddaughter. And it's time that she showed him a little bit of support, especially after everything that he's been through. I mean, after the last couple of weeks, don't we realize now that life is precious and it's fleeting? And if you find love, you need to hold onto it and don't let it go. That's what you need to do. That's what I'm doing with my husband. I'm not letting anything or anyone ever come between me and Eric ever again.",
        "Ridge: You don't think I'm happy you're here? You don't think the family's happy? Your well-being is the most important thing to me.",
        "Eric: Is... is it?",
        "Ridge: All right, Dad. Great.",
        "Eric: Needed... my wife.",
        "Ridge: [Sighs] Legally she's not your wife. Yeah, you had a ceremony, but you didn't sign the papers and you didn't file them with the state. You know what? Maybe this isn't the right time to do it, but I don't think there is a good time. So this is it. I had a new power of attorney drawn up. It's got my name on it. And before you say anything, no, this is not about king ridge trying to take everything that you worked for your whole life. This is about your eldest son protecting you, protecting this company, and protecting the legacy that you and Mom built for 50 years. [Sighs] Can... can you just try to be reasonable? I get it. You're disappointed in the family. I get it. You're disappointed in me. I didn't know how much until just now. Man, this isn't about people not showing up for your wedding day. This is about the company, about our total assets, the properties, the kids' trust funds. There -- there are thousands of employees all over the world, and they have families. You know what they want? They want for Forrester Creations to be strong and prosperous. And Quinn -- I don't care how you feel about her. She can't handle that. I can. [Sighs] It has to be me. Let it be me. [Sighs]"
