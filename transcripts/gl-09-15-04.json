        "Reva: Yes, I'm sorry. I think we were disconnected. I'm calling about information about my son who went to school there. Yes, his name is jonathon randall. Well, I'm his biological mother. I understand that. But what are you telling me? That I have to fly to switzerland or something?",
        "Sandy: Reva, what are you doing?",
        "Ruth: Ruth speaking.",
        "Bill: Hey, it's me bill. Everything okay?",
        "Ruth: So far so good.",
        "Bill: Well, I was getting a little nervous. Is phillip there with you?",
        "Ruth: No, I'm waiting for mr. Spaulding now.",
        "Bill: All right. Well, just be careful, okay?",
        "Ruth: I will be. Forgive me, sir, my cat is in the veterinarian.",
        "Phillip: Oh, I'm sorry. Is everything okay?",
        "Ruth: Yes, sir.",
        "Phillip: That's good. Now where were we?",
        "Ruth: I was about to tell why I'd make the perfect executive assistant.",
        "Phillip: That's right. And I was about to tell you how you could prove it.",
        "Edmund: Bill.",
        "Bill: Hey, how's cassie?",
        "Edmund: Fine... considering the woman who once tried to kill her is back in town.",
        "Bill: Listen, edmund, I'm not even going to try to defend dinah.",
        "Edmund: Good.",
        "Bill: But I think it's important that everyone understands that cassie has nothing to worry about. I mean that was a long time ago when dinah was going through a lot.",
        "Edmund: Oh, I see. So if you have a bad day you should shoot someone, because that'll make you feel better?",
        "Bill: That's not what I'm saying. Dinah never had it easy. Okay, she lived a very lonely existence. Hart was her first love and when that fell apart, she lost it. That's all. But she's come a long way. She's back in town because she wants to make it right. Just like the rest of us.",
        "Edmund: Well, a lot of people experience loneliness and rejection, bill. It doesn't mean they should go out and kill someone.",
        "Bill: Edmund, she's had it rough from day one. If you want to be mad at someone, maybe you should be mad at my mother. Maybe she thought she was doing the right thing when she gave my sister away. But she set her up for life of being unloved.",
        "Edmund: Perhaps if she wants to be loved she should adjust her behavior.",
        "Bill: And she has. She has. And that's what I'm trying to say. The hart incident, that was an isolated thing.",
        "Edmund: Dinah is lucky to have a brother like you. She really is. But of you want to do something good for your sister, persuade her to stay away from cassie and family.",
        "Bill: Interesting.",
        "Edmund: Interesting? What's interesting?",
        "Bill: I think you of all people would have a little understanding for her.",
        "Cassie: Sweetie, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.",
        "Tammy: It's not you. It's everything.",
        "Cassie: Why don't we go inside and lay down? Or you could help me make brownies. Rj would love brownies.",
        "Tammy: No, I'm not tired or hungry. And I don't want to be in there. Every time I walk through that door all I can think about... all I can see is hart lying there after dinah shot him.",
        "Cassie: Okay, okay. You know what? We have a lot of good memories here and we're going to have to concentrate on those.",
        "Tammy: I try to. But then my head always goes back to that one day and dinah. And I think about her being back here in our house going through our stuff.",
        "Cassie: She's in jail, okay. She can't hurt us.",
        "Tammy: But it was so easy for her to slip back into our lives.",
        "Cassie: Until she was caught. Right? She's behind bars.",
        "Tammy: There's no way I could feel safe, mom. And I don't think you do either.",
        "Dinah: I see you've come to your senses.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, I know what i have to do.",
        "Dinah: Good. You're going to get me out of here. Smart man.",
        "Jeffrey: You know, I've listened to your threats and I've watched you try to control me and the situation. I've got to hand it to you, dinah, you're in top form. Always looking out for yourself, aren't you?",
        "Dinah: Like anybody else would? Yeah.",
        "Jeffrey: You know, I could understand why you would say that... even though it's not true.",
        "Dinah: Who you?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, me. Why not me?",
        "Dinah: Well, I could think of a few reasons.",
        "Jeffrey: You know there's something that I wanted to do ever since I saw you back here.",
        "Dinah: Jeffrey, look. I don't need...",
        "Reva: Hey, I know that I said that I wasn't going to interfere, but I'm worried about you.",
        "Sandy: I thought you said you would drop this whole over protective mother thing if i stayed in springfield. What happened to our deal?",
        "Reva: Did we have a deal? Oh, come on. Sandy, look, I'm just... I'm a mother whose trying to protect her kid. That's what mother's do.",
        "Sandy: When you're ten. Do I look ten?",
        "Reva: Well, sometimes you act that way.",
        "Sandy: You make me feel it.",
        "Reva: Well, I didn't mean that. It wasn't my intent and I'm sorry.",
        "Sandy: Stop saying you're sorry and just don't do it anymore. In fact, stop messing around in my life period.",
        "Reva: Hey!",
        "Sandy: And don't try and justify it either because you can'T. I've got by this far without your help and I think I can survive.",
        "Reva: But that's the point, sandy. You don't have to. I'm here for you now. Let me help you.",
        "Sandy: See, you're impossible. This is exactly why I was going to leave. No wonder marah and shayne and dylan all took off. They had to get away from you as fast as they could.",
        "Edmund: You see me and dinah as soulmates? Am I suppose to be flattered by that?",
        "Bill: All I'm saying is for a man whose made his share of mistakes, I would think you would have a little compassion for her.",
        "Edmund: Well, I've made my fair share of mistakes, which means I know what she's capable of doing.",
        "Bill: And you understand her because you're just as capable of going overboard if you're thinking you're losing someone you love. Later.",
        "Dinah: I want a simple agreement. You keep my secrets and I keep yours. As far as deals with the devil, this isn't so bad. And even if it were you can't afford to turn this down.",
        "Jeffrey: I have the wrong person.",
        "Phillip: All right, ruth, let me tell you what I expect. I... you don't have to take notes. That's all right. I appreciate the energy, but it's not necessary.",
        "Ruth: Please continue, mr. Spaulding.",
        "Phillip: All right. What I expect... what I demand is complete loyalty and discretion.",
        "Ruth: I assure you, mr. Spaulding, I built a career on discretion.",
        "Phillip: That's what I want to hear. Now tell me again, ruth, why exactly did you feel that you needed to employ of mr. Lewis?",
        "Ruth: Young mr. Lewis was scattered, disorganized. Miss spencer was a manipulative, shrew of a boss. (Phillip laughs) excuse my candor, sir.",
        "Phillip: No, that's quite all right. I happen to agree with you. I'm thinking, ruth, maybe there's some other things about the lewis operation that you could tell me. Things that maybe I don't know.",
        "Ruth: Are you trying to bribe me, sir?",
        "Phillip: I have always thought that bribe was a very harsh word. Information is a valuable currency and I would insist that you be compensated for it. Come on, ruth. Now if I know the lewises, that's more than you've made in the six months.",
        "Lizzie: Joey. I completely forgot it was your first day.",
        "Joey: Yeah, I'm on my break and I want to say hi to your dad. Thank him for the job.",
        "Lizzie: Kissing up to the boss.",
        "Joey: That's not what I'm doing, lizzie.",
        "Lizzie: No, of course not. You don't need to. You're better than that. Too good for it.",
        "Joey: Look, lizzie, do we have to do this?",
        "Lizzie: What? I'm just giving you a compliment. I'm not trying to pressure you or anything.",
        "Joey: I kind of felt pressured at company.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, I know. And I really feel horrible about that. I've been trying to figure out how I need to act around you. I mean we slept together, joey. And for me that was... it's just going to take me a while to get over it. And I hope you could be patient with me.",
        "Joey: Just be yourself, okay, lizzie? Otherwise tammy's going to...",
        "Lizzie: I know. She'll suspect something and we both don't want that to happen.",
        "Tammy: I'm having that nightmare again. It's the night that dinah shot hart and she comes back to the farm and she shoots you, too. Then she turns the gun on me. When she pulls the trigger, i wake up.",
        "Cassie: Yeah. One more reminder of everything you've been through in your life.",
        "Tammy: Yeah.",
        "Cassie: We've both been through. Tammy, I can't make this go away. But dinah is behind bars and she's going to stay there.",
        "Tammy: Unless she gets paroled in a couple of years.",
        "Cassie: I'll fight it.",
        "Tammy: She says she's changed. They could believe her.",
        "Cassie: Nobody changes that much, okay. They can say they have, but all it takes is one thing to set them off and it'S...",
        "Dinah: What was that? My good-bye present?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, let's just say that I wanted to show you how i feel.",
        "Danny: How you feel? Since when?",
        "Jeffrey: I've tried to get close to a few people in my life, but it never worked out. I always pushed them away. I don't know why. Maybe it was because I was afraid. But with you, there's something that keeps pulling me back. I don't know what it is.",
        "Dinah: Maybe because I know you better than anyone.",
        "Jeffrey: Maybe.",
        "Dinah: And I don't judge you.",
        "Jeffrey: And you make me feel alive.",
        "Dinah: What do you want, jeffrey?",
        "Jeffrey: What I want? I want you.",
        "Dinah: You're serious.",
        "Jeffrey: I want you. And I want us to go away together. Yes, I'm serious.",
        "Dinah: And how would you pull something like that off?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, first of all, we can't let this thing go to trial. That'll be way too risky. So I got to figure out some way to spring you out of here.",
        "Dinah: My, you'll do that all for me?",
        "Jeffrey: Of course I'd do it for you.",
        "Dinah: We can go anywhere you want.",
        "Jeffrey: Anywhere.",
        "Dinah: Well...",
        "Jeffrey: Do you remember monaco?",
        "Dinah: (Laughs) I do. Yes, monaco was a blast. This is very sudden. Hmm?",
        "Jeffrey: You're the one that told me that I don't belong here, right? That I'll never fit in here.",
        "Dinah: You won'T.",
        "Jeffrey: You're not going to fit in here either.",
        "Dinah: I could.",
        "Jeffrey: You want these people constantly judging you? Do you want those people around you all the time? No. You need that about as much as i do.",
        "Dinah: Well, you're right about that.",
        "Jeffrey: All right, so what do you say, huh? Let's get out of here.",
        "Cassie: Edmund, we were",
        "Cassie: Edmund, we were talking about dinah.",
        "Edmund: I know.",
        "Tammy: Uncle edmund, do you believe that dinah could have changed?",
        "Edmund: I don't know, tammy. I never knew dinah. I don't have no point of reference.",
        "Cassie: Well, you could borrow mine. She's a wack job.",
        "Edmund: Your mother's probably right, tammy. It's not possible for anyone to completely change.",
        "Cassie: Hey, for some people. But you know they have to prove that overtime.",
        "Tammy: That isn't good enough for me.",
        "Cassie: Can we stop thinking and talking about dinah?",
        "Tammy: No. I need to get out of here for a little while.",
        "Tammy: No, no, no. I need to go by myself. Please don't follow me.",
        "Cassie: Tammy.",
        "Edmund: Let her go. Let her go. Let her go.",
        "Cassie: I am worried about her, edmund.",
        "Edmund: I'm worried about both of you. I wish there was some way i could make this all go away.",
        "Reva: Is that what you really think? That I push my kids away?",
        "Sandy: I'm sorry I said that.",
        "Reva: Well, you don't have to be, but now I'm going to have pummel you.",
        "Sandy: I said I was sorry.",
        "Reva: Put yourself in my shoes, sandy. You know someone that you care about a lot and you know they're in trouble. What do you do just sit back and do nothing? Or do you help?",
        "Sandy: No, I would help. But in this case, I don't need any help.",
        "Reva: Yeah, but my guts telling me something different.",
        "Sandy: Well, your guts wrong. Ignore it.",
        "Reva: I can'T. This mom doesn't operate that way.",
        "Sandy: It's just not right that you're worrying about me when...",
        "Reva: What?",
        "Sandy: Nothing.",
        "Reva: No, come on. Tell me. You said it's wrong for me to be worry about you when what?",
        "Sandy: When phillip spaulding is trying to steal cross creek.",
        "Reva: He what?",
        "Ruth: I can't accept this, sir.",
        "Phillip: What if I were to double it?",
        "Ruth: Mr. Spaulding, you may not approve of mr. Lewis, but I'm not a gossip. It would be the same if I left your employ.",
        "Phillip: (Sighs) congratulations, ruth, you just passed the first test.",
        "Ruth: Thank you, sir. I'm thrilled beyond words.",
        "Phillip: I certainly wouldn't want to have someone working for me whose head was easily turned by the smell of fresh bills.",
        "Ruth: Are you offering me the job, sir?",
        "Phillip: Not yet.",
        "Lizzie: I just want us to be friends, okay. Maybe I could prove it to you by taking you to lunch today.",
        "Joey: Lizzie, I don't know if that's such a good idea.",
        "Lizzie: Come on. Burgers in the cafeteria are great. I know that if we could just hang out together then you'll see everything's back to normal again.",
        "Joey: Maybe. (Phone rings) hello? Hey, tam. What? No, no, no. I'll come over there. You shouldn't go by yourself. Yeah. Okay, just stay put. Bye. Look I got to go.",
        "Lizzie: You can't go anywhere. This is your first day of work.",
        "Josh: Lizzie, I'm on a break, okay. I'll be a little late back. I got to go.",
        "Lizzie: Daddy! I need your help. Everything is falling apart. Who are you?",
        "Dinah: You'd really leave this place and just throw away your career?",
        "Jeffrey: I was leaving anyway.",
        "Dinah: Yeah, I know. But you'd have to break the law and throw your life away.",
        "Jeffrey: No, I start a new life with you.",
        "Dinah: Hmm. Well, that means that would be on the run and that's not a walk in the park. And what would we do for money?",
        "Jeffrey: I would take care of you, dinah. Haven't I always taken care of you? We could go to that chalet in the alps. You love the snow, you could ski all day, we could spend our nights in front of the fire.",
        "Dinah: Mm-hmm. Yes, and that's sounds incredibly romantic, yes, but how long could that last?",
        "Jeffrey: How about forever?",
        "Jeffrey: How about forever? Huh? Come on. We're going to get out here and we'll leave these messed up people to their messed up lives.",
        "Dinah: And leave cassie to her life. This isn't about you wanting me. This is about you wanting to protect cassie.",
        "Jeffrey: Why do you have to always think about it like that?",
        "Dinah: Well, see because that's what it is. You're leaving a woman to protect her. Very simple.",
        "Jeffrey: I'm offering something here. Something that could be perfect and all you can think about is cassie.",
        "Dinah: All I could think about is cassie. No, excuse me. I think I have a few other things to worry about here. I told you I will never ever be her stand in again.",
        "Jeffrey: You'd rather go to prison.",
        "Dinah: Oh, I'm not going to prison, because you're going to get me out of here.",
        "Jeffrey: I can't stop this case, dinah, okay. Get that through your head. The case is moving forward.",
        "Dinah: If it does, I will tell cassie every single thing, every dirty little thing and she'll hate you.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, she's hated me before. And she's going to hate me again. You just made a big mistake.",
        "Cassie: Hey, what are you doing?",
        "Rj: Looking for my friend. The lady that saved me.",
        "Cassie: Oh. Rj, sweetie, I know that she seemed like your friend, but she's not. Not really.",
        "Rj: She told me stories and brought me ice cream.",
        "Cassie: Ice cream? That day at the hotel? Rj, is dinah your imaginary friend? The imaginary friend that you have been playing with for weeks now? Oh, my god. You know what? The imaginary friend that you have been playing with for weeks now? Oh, my god. You know what? Can you go upstairs and play with your cars and I'll bring your brownies up in a little while? Great. Oh, my god.",
        "Edmund: What are you doing?",
        "Cassie: Dinah is a dead woman. Coming up on \"guiding light\"...",
        "Edmund: So your life on the run has changed you? Is that it? You wouldn't kill anyone, but blackmail all right?",
        "Dinah: If I go down, you go down with me.",
        "Ruth: Madame, this is a place of business. You'll need to leave at once.",
        "Olivia: You know what? But out! What's going on with you? Why have you turned into such a complete ass?",
        "Sandy: Reva, I wasn't suppose to say anything.",
        "Reva: I don't care. Just tell me what you know.",
        "Sandy: I don't really know anything.",
        "Reva: Sandy...",
        "Sandy: I know that phillip tricked hawk into signing something and josh and billy are...",
        "Bill: Whoa.",
        "Reva: God, bill. Do you know anything about this? Why didn't josh tell me? Is phillip trying to steal cross creek from us?",
        "Bill: Nice going.",
        "Sandy: Sorry.",
        "Bill: Yeah, we didn't want you to worry.",
        "Reva: No, you didn't want me getting in the middle of it.",
        "Bill: Well, that, too.",
        "Reva: This isn't funny. Josh should have told me. You all should have said something to me.",
        "Bill: So what are you going to do? Fly off the handle, get emotional and crazy?",
        "Reva: Why wouldn't I get emotional? It's cross creek. Josh and I were married there, shayne was born there. Your granddaddy H.B. Is resting under that big oak tree in the yard. You think I'm just going to sit back and let phillip take all that away from us?",
        "Bill: Reva, please? Dad and uncle josh are handling it. They do not want you to interfere.",
        "Reva: Interfere?",
        "Bill: That's right.",
        "Reva: Well, this is my life, too.",
        "Bill: Well, mine, too. You're going to help me out here.",
        "Sandy: I have yet to figure out how to change her mind.",
        "Bill: Is that right? Is that right? Will you please, please at least call uncle josh first?",
        "Reva: Okay, I'll call josh. He's not going to like it because I don't know who I'm madder at right now-- phillip or him. Excuse me.",
        "Bill: Oh, you're looking for your phone?",
        "Reva: No, I'm not looking for my phone. Give me that. You take those. I shouldn't drive, because I'm liable to plow my car right into his front door.",
        "Ruth: I'm ruth karloff, dear. I'm interviewing for a position here.",
        "Lizzie: Lizzie spaulding.",
        "Ruth: Yes. I'll give you two some time.",
        "Derrick: You'll never get this job. Mr. Spaulding will see right through you.",
        "Phillip: So joey left work to go see tammy?",
        "Lizzie: Don't get angry, dad. I told him I would cover for him. Sort of.",
        "Phillip: I'm not going to tolerate that kind of behavior.",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, but you can't get him in trouble. I wouldn't want you to do that.",
        "Phillip: Lizzie, this boy was fanning interest in you so that he could get a job here.",
        "Lizzie: No. No, it wasn't like that at all. Joey's like the greatest guy i know. Well, besides you. And I can't lose him. It's tammy's fault. She's playing on his sympathies and she's trying to confuse him, but I'm so much smarter than her. I'm not... I'm going to stop her.",
        "Phillip: Are you sure that this boy is what you really want?",
        "Lizzie: More than anything.",
        "Phillip: I'll help you.",
        "Lizzie: You will?",
        "Phillip: Well, that's what you came here for, isn't it?",
        "Lizzie: Well, yeah, but how are you going to help?",
        "Phillip: You leave that to me?",
        "Lizzie: I can't believe you'd actually do this for me.",
        "Phillip: Honey, you're my princess and I adore you and i will do anything to make you happy.",
        "Ruth: Excuse me, dear. Who are you?",
        "Derrick: Derrick james. I'm applying for the assistance position. Actually I've been working in the company for over a year toiling in the mailroom.",
        "Ruth: Good for you, mr. James. Now get lost. You're too late.",
        "Derrick: Excuse me.",
        "Ruth: Do you have wax in your ears, young man? I'm mr. Spauldings new assistance. He just hired me.",
        "Derrick: Yeah, but hr sent me. Well, hr made a mistake, mailboy. As did you. Coming in here like you own the place. Fyi, I was organizing my desk.",
        "Derrick: Oh, organizing. It looked to me more like you were searching the place.",
        "Ruth: Tell me mr. James, would you like a better job or would you like a fat lip?",
        "Cop: Stay put, okay.",
        "Tammy: Hello, dinah.",
        "Dinah: Tammy. What are you doing here?",
        "Tammy: Why did you come back here?",
        "Dinah: Well, to face up to what I did. I made a mistake.",
        "Tammy: A mistake. You murdered hart.",
        "Dinah: I know. I did something terrible. And I'm going to regret that every single day for the rest of my life.",
        "Tammy: That's not going to bring hart back. It won't do anything.",
        "Dinah: There's nothing I can say at all that's going to take away your pain. But I know that you loved him. And I loved him, too.",
        "Tammy: Oh, that's right, you were gunning for my mom.",
        "Dinah: Tammy, I am sorry.",
        "Tammy: I don't care. And I know that you keep telling everybody that you've changed, but I don't believe it. And I will never forgive you for what you did.",
        "Joey: Whoa, lady, why don't you sit back down? You okay?",
        "Tammy: I'm fine.",
        "Joey: If I had known who you were back at the farm, I would have turned her into the cops myself.",
        "Dinah: I'm sure you would have. You are very lucky to have a guy like this care for you so much. I take it you guys are back together. I've been around long enough in town to hear what's been going on. My cousin, lizzie, she still giving you problems?",
        "Tammy: It's over now.",
        "Dinah: You are as sweet and pure as your mom is. Let me tell you something if you learn one thing from my presence in your life, you should watch out for girls like me who tend to love a little too much.",
        "Tammy: Let me tell you something, dinah. I'm not scared. And neither is my mom. You can't hurt us ever again.",
        "Edmund: What's going on?",
        "Cassie: Dinah was rj's imaginary friend.",
        "Edmund: What?",
        "Cassie: She was stalking him. Stalking him. She already took one person i love. She's not going to take my son. Now give me the knife back, edmund.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, stop.",
        "Cassie: Give it to me.",
        "Edmund: Stop. What are you going to do? Smuggle it in the police station?",
        "Cassie: She has to pay.",
        "Edmund: She will, cassie.",
        "Cassie: Yeah, you bet she will. Because I'm going to do everything I can to make sure she spends the rest of her life in prison. Can you believe this? Can you believe my son's new best friend is the woman who killed his father?! That is so sick.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, I want you to stop worrying about dinah.",
        "Rj: Mommy, I'm hungry.",
        "Cassie: You're hungry. Okay.",
        "Edmund: Cassie, I have to run an errand. I won't be long. Excuse me.",
        "Cassie: Edmund, wait. Edmund?",
        "Rj: Are you mad because of my friend?",
        "Cassie: No. Come here. Come here. I'm not mad, okay. But I need you to understand something. You're never going to see your friend again. She's going away and she's not coming back. I'm sorry. Here take these. Go upstairs and I'll be up there as soon as I can. I'm glad you're here.",
        "Jeffrey: Well, that's a first.",
        "Cassie: I've made my mind up about dinah. Does the state still have the death penalty?",
        "Ruth: Shorthand.",
        "Reva: What are you doing? I mean we're friends, right? We go way back? Obviously that doesn't mean anything to you.",
        "Phillip: Yes, we're friends. I assume this is about cross creek.",
        "Reva: Damn right it's about cross creek.",
        "Phillip: It's not personal. It's just business.",
        "Reva: It is personal. It's very personal and you know it.",
        "Ruth: Madame, this is place a business. You'll need to leave at once.",
        "Reva: You know what? Butt out! What's going on with you? Why have you turned into such a complete ass?",
        "Phillip: Reva, calm down.",
        "Reva: Don't tell me to calm down. You know I should teach you a lesson. ( Sighs)",
        "Ruth: Madame, mr. Spaulding asked you to calm down. I think it's time you did just that.",
        "Edmund: So, what were you doing with rj? I know that you were his imaginary friend.",
        "Dinah: Mm-hmm.",
        "Edmund: So what were you hoping to accomplish? You were going to get him to trust you then kidnap him? What?",
        "Dinah: Rj is hart's son. I helped bring him into this world. I would never do anything to hurt that boy.",
        "Edmund: But you would do something to hurt cassie?",
        "Dinah: No. No. If I wanted to hurt cassie or rj, I had plenty of opportunities.",
        "Edmund: So your life on the run has changed you, is that it? You wouldn't kill anyone, but blackmail's all right?",
        "Dinah: Well, I prefer to call it self preservation.",
        "Edmund: Call it whatever you like. It doesn't matter. Cassie is more determined than ever to see that you're prosecuted for what you done to the fullest existent of the law and I'm not so incline to disagree.",
        "Dinah: Well, I think maybe you should rethink that, because if go down, you go down with me.",
        "Cassie: Do you remember that day we were on the porch and we didn't believe that rj was talking to someone?",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah. It was dinah.",
        "Cassie: It was dinah. We were only ten feet away. Oh, and get this: That day at the hotel when rj had ice cream? She gave it to him, because he told me.",
        "Jeffrey: And that was the same day...",
        "Cassie: That the flowerpot fell on my head. Yeah, I know. So, she hasn't changed, okay? She is still a cold-blooded killer and I'm still her target.",
        "Jeffrey: You know, cassie, there's no proof of anything.",
        "Cassie: I don't need proof, okay? I know it was her. And she has to be stopped, and you have to stop her.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay. If that's what you really want.",
        "Cassie: Yes, that's what i want. What is going on with you? Why are you acting like this?",
        "Jeffrey: Well, because, cassie, sometimes justice comes at a high price. So, I need to know if you're going to be willing to pay that price.",
        "Reva: Let me go.",
        "Phillip: It's all right, ruth. You can let her go.",
        "Reva: And don't touch me again. What is she, your personal guard dog?",
        "Phillip: Reva, I really don't want there to be any hard feelings between us.",
        "Reva: Fine. Back off cross creek.",
        "Phillip: I'm sorry, I can't do that.",
        "Reva: So the rumors are true. You really should be back in the nut house.",
        "Phillip: You know, I really wish you would stop trying to make this personal, although i know emotional histrionics are your strong suit.",
        "Reva: You pompous idiot.",
        "Cop: Mr. Spaulding, there's a disturbance?",
        "Ruth: I took the liberty of calling for assistance, mr. Spaulding. I hope you don't mind.",
        "Phillip: That's all right, ruth. I think mrs. Lewis is finished.",
        "Reva: Not even close.",
        "Phillip: Oh. Arrest her.",
        "Sandy: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa. There's no need to do that.",
        "Reva: I'm not done. We're not through with this yet. You're going to be so sorry, phillip.",
        "Sandy: Come on. I'll make sure that she doesn't bother you again.",
        "Phillip: If you'd like to argue with me, you can join her.",
        "Ruth: What an eventful day, sir.",
        "Phillip: Ruth, you brute. You're hired!",
        "Joey: I'm proud of you.",
        "Tammy: You are?",
        "Joey: What you did took guts.",
        "Tammy: I just want to forget about it.",
        "Joey: Forget about what?",
        "Tammy: You know, maybe I'll go over to the springfield U. Campus and help remy and marina with the voter registration drive.",
        "Lizzie: Um, excuse me. I just wanted to tell you that it's completely okay that you left early. I took care of it.",
        "Joey: Thanks.",
        "Lizzie: Okay. Well, I'll see you later. Hey, I need to see you.",
        "Jb: I'm busy.",
        "Lizzie: Well, you need to get un-busy, okay? This is more important.",
        "Jb: Oh, let me guess. You need help picking out what shoes to wear for your coming out party?",
        "Lizzie: Yeah, very funny. Okay, listen, this is about tammy. Are you still interested?",
        "Jb: Depends.",
        "Lizzie: Okay, well, I think i can hook you two up but, you know, I'm not going to beg.",
        "Jb: Where are you?",
        "Lizzie: Well, not now. Like, tomorrow. Meet me at company.",
        "Jb: I'll be there.",
        "Bill: What are you doing here?",
        "Ruth: I have good news and i have bad news.",
        "Bill: All right, well, just tell me.",
        "Ruth: The bad news is, I got reva shayne arrested.",
        "Bill: Well, what's the good news?",
        "Ruth: I'm hired.",
        "Bill: That's great! Oh, sorry. Did I... I'm sorry. That's okay. I need to get out of this get-up anyway. Whew. Say hello to phillip's new executive assistant. (Laughter)",
        "Cassie: I know a trial won't be easy but I have to go through with this.",
        "Jeffrey: Won't be easy? Cassie, that's the understatement of the year, okay? It's going to be a vicious dogfight. Tammy is going to have to testify, which means that she's going to have to relive that night all over again.",
        "Cassie: My daughter is every bit as strong as I am, and we'll get through this together.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay. Well, that's good, because you're going to need each other. For the hours and hours of prepping for the trial. And then once we finally get to the trial, I hope you're ready for this, okay, because dinah is going to be presented as the heartbroken fiancee while you and your lover, hart, are going to be the dirty adulterers who couldn't keep their hands off of each other.",
        "Cassie: But that's not true.",
        "Jeffrey: There's no such thing as truth, okay? What matters is the perception of the truth. In the courtroom and out. Think about the media circus, okay? Have you thought about that? Have you thought about the tabloids? And all of your children are going to be affected, cassie. Especially little rj.",
        "Cassie: Why are you doing this? Why are you making this sound so awful?",
        "Jeffrey: You need to know what you're up against, here. You need to know how brutal this is going to be.",
        "Cassie: I get it, okay?",
        "Jeffrey: I hope so. Because when this is over, you're going to ask yourself, \"was it worth it?\" And you're going to blame me.",
        "Cassie: I doubt that.",
        "Jeffrey: Trust me, you will.",
        "Dinah: Don't you look at me like that. I only have your best interests at heart.",
        "Edmund: Oh, I see. So my best interests are your best interests?",
        "Dinah: Yeah. Something like that. You know, this is not about you losing cassie. This is about me seeing you hit jeffrey over the head with a shovel, cause the fire that nearly killed her and her son.",
        "Edmund: Oh, how I wish you were trapped in that barn.",
        "Dinah: Oh. Well, that's not very nice, edmund. Look, I like you. I just hate the idea of both of us going to prison.",
        "Edmund: Well, it would almost be worth it to know how much you'd be suffering.",
        "Dinah: You don't mean that.",
        "Edmund: Don't I?",
        "Dinah: No. You're a very smart man. And you're going to figure out a way to fix this.",
        "Edmund: If I ever think that you're a threat to cassie and the children again, I will tell her everything.",
        "Dinah: And risk losing her? I don't think so. I think that you want to hang on to her. I think I've seen that firsthand.",
        "Edmund: Don't test me.",
        "Dinah: Okay. Look, I don't want to get ugly, here. I want to keep your secrets, i really do.",
        "Edmund: Well, I know what i have to do now. Right. I need a favor. And I need you to be discreet. Next, on \"guiding light\"...",
        "Reva: You're here to get back at cassie and her entire family.",
        "Dinah: And I have to go through you, first.",
        "Reva: You can try. But I guarantee it'll be the last thing you ever do.",
        "Jeffrey: When this decision that you've made goes south, I'm going to have to jump in and save your life yet again.",
        "Cassie: If things go badly, it won't be my life that needs saving."
