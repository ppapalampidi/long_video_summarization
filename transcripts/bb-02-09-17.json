        "Brooke and Katie share lunch at Katie's. On the subject of Quinn, Brooke asks if Quinn would be right that Katie is interested in Eric. Katie says they have known Eric a very long time and he is stable so of course she adores him, always has, but that is it. Steffy comes back to the office with cake crumbs all in her hair and over her dress. Sally is delighted to hear the whole thing is on video for the world --- Steffy's world to see. Now they will all know that Spectra is back. Steffy asks if all of this was payback, a plant for taking the job Thomas thought should be his. He says he only met Sally once. They are aghast when Zende shows them the food fight is already online for all to see. Looks like it is game on for Steffy and Sally. Saul says she is a genius and she will never have to advertise. Darlita shows up and wants to apply for the receptionist job. At the same time the press shows up to ask Sally a few questions. Against the idea of Darlita being there, Sally does tell her to let the press in. Quinn tells Eric that sometimes she looks at him and thinks this is not real. Something might drive him away and that might be her if she does something wrong. He says things happen that they cannot predict or keep away from. She says she keeps hearing this voice inside her that says he could do so much better than her. She does not know what she would do to keep that from happening.",
        "Quinn steps out for some air and Brooke comes over. Yet Quinn is just outside the door ajar and overhears. Brooke admits that he is not to tell anyone but she thinks Katie has developed a crush on him. He says he has known Katie forever and loves praise but he cannot even imagine Katie having intentions toward a married man or use that word crush. Brooke asks about Quinn and says if it ever comes down to Quinn or loneliness, then think again. Eric tells her that she must be suffering from jet lag so maybe she should go home. As she leaves she runs into Quinn just boldly standing there who looks at her with a vengeance and says tell her sister that she will be watching her. Pam joins the crowd in Steffy's office and shows them that Sally is being interviewed on The Eye On Fashion. Sally ends with a warning - get ready Los Angeles and Steffy Forrester, Spectra is back and better than ever."

        "Brooke: So she was weaving in and out of traffic on this noisy little scooter.",
        "Katie: Oh, my gosh. That sounds terrifying.",
        "Brooke: Well, hope says that driving an actual car is even more scary.",
        "Katie: So, what does she think about you walking down the aisle one more time with ridge?",
        "Brooke: Like everybody else. She wasn't surprised.",
        "Katie: I can think of at least one person that I was married to that seemed a little surprised.",
        "Brooke: Moving right along...",
        "Katie: Mm-hmm.",
        "Brooke: How about you? Are you dating anybody?",
        "Katie: No, not really. I have got a few, um, business prospects that look interesting. I've got the house. Eric pops over for lunch every now and then. It's nice. Feels a little clandestine.",
        "Brooke: Because Quinn doesn't know?",
        "Katie: Yeah, she would just jump to all kinds of conclusions.",
        "Brooke: Would she be wrong?",
        "Quinn: Is there too much green in this?",
        "Eric: I don't see it.",
        "Quinn: How about now? See it?",
        "Eric: [Chuckles] What an eye you have. It's a perfect pairing.",
        "Quinn: Mm. Just you and me. Are you going out to lunch today? Linda said sometimes you do.",
        "Eric: Not when I have you for company.",
        "Quinn: [Chuckles]",
        "Nicole: Look what you made me do! If I goofed off as much as you, I'd be fired.",
        "Zende: [Chuckles] Oh, come on. I would love to see them try. When is this buyers' banquet anyhow?",
        "Nicole: All I know is when I asked Pam if she needed help, I didn't expect it to be with this.",
        "Zende: Mm. Well, looks like you messed up on this one. You put darnel love.",
        "Nicole: Because that's his name.",
        "Zende: Oh. Well, I thought maybe... I don't know, what it is called? A Freudian slip?",
        "Pam: Steffy, what happened to you? You're all covered --",
        "Steffy: Not now, pam. Oh, that I am covered in cake? Thank you, pam. A number of people have already mentioned that, thank you.",
        "Thomas: Do you want a cappuccino to go with that?",
        "Steffy: No, don't even start with me, Thomas. Tell me how you even know that spectra girl.",
        "Pam: Spectra?",
        "Sally: Did it upload or didn't it?",
        "Saul: Well, you said we couldn't afford the high-speed internet, sally, so...",
        "Shirley: It's doing something, I think.",
        "Sally: It has to work! We haven't got the scratch for the paid promotion.",
        "Saul: We don't even have stationery.",
        "Sally: Who needs it, Saul, if we can't get queen Steffy's followers to spread the word that spectra's back?",
        "Saul: It posted. Oh! Oh! It posted.",
        "Sally: Oh, yes!",
        "[Screaming]",
        "Thomas: What is happening?! Stop! Stop! Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!",
        "Steffy: Get her out of here!",
        "Thomas: All right, get --",

        "Saul: [Laughs]",
        "Nicole: So, a food fight?",
        "Steffy: Thomas, was this planned? Was this all because you're unhappy with me?",
        "Thomas: Stef, stop it. I bumped into her once, literally, at the bar.",
        "Steffy: So you just hit on sally spectra.",
        "Pam: Thomas!",
        "Thomas: No, I didn't hit on sally spectra. I don't think -- no, I probably hit on sally spectra. Yeah.",
        "Steffy: Unbelievable.",
        "Sally: Who am I at eye on fashion? I can't keep track of my usernames.",
        "Shirley: Was it \"Dolores danger?\"",
        "Sally: Oh! Oh, I'm in!",
        "Shirley: Mm. Where is the buzz? The gossip! I sent it to all the media outlets.",
        "Saul: Yeah, I'm coming up with bupkis, too. Is there a high-def button you forgot to press?",
        "Sally: Oh, my page just refreshed! [Gasps] We have likes! Glorious likes! [Laughs] It worked!",
        "Eric: Was I talking to myself?",
        "Quinn: No.",
        "Eric: Sometimes I can do that.",
        "Quinn: [Laughs] I know.",
        "Eric: Then what?",
        "Quinn: Sometimes I look at you and I get afraid.",
        "Eric: Afraid of me?",
        "Quinn: Afraid this isn't real. Afraid it won't last. That something can take you away or drive you away... and that something could be me.",
        "Katie: Do you think I'm doing something wrong?",
        "Brooke: Do you think you are?",
        "Katie: No! Just having lunch with a friend. That's it.",
        "Brooke: It sounds to me like you think you're getting away with something.",
        "Katie: [Scoffs]",
        "Brooke: Are you starting to see Eric as maybe more than just a friend?",
        "Zende: This spectra thing is everywhere. We need to get some security on it now.",
        "Nicole: Pam says this change of clothes will fit.",
        "Steffy: Oh. Thank you.",
        "Thomas: You know, spectra's best-selling designs always did start out as Forrester.",
        "Steffy: Well, this new sally calls herself a designer, so...",
        "Thomas: You saw her style. Do you think that's actually gonna catch on?",
        "Zende: Uh, you might want to take a look at this. Somebody posted the whole thing online.",
        "Steffy: [Gasps] Oh, my god.",
        "Thomas: [Chuckles]",
        "Sally: Take it easy, Queenie!",
        "Steffy: [Gasps] Oh, my god!",
        "Saul: \"Totally fake -- that doesn't even look like Steffy.\"",
        "Sally: Ugh. Troll!",
        "Shirley: Over 6,000 views already!",
        "Sally: How many a minute is that?",
        "Saul: \"Yes, that's Steffy. I saw her wearing that outfit before.\"",
        "Shirley: Over 498 shares!",
        "Saul: \"Steffy never wears anything twice!\" [Laughs]",
        "Sally: Idiot!",
        "Shirley: \"Sally's look is fab.\"",
        "Sally: Finally! Some intelligence.",
        "Saul: \"Looks like it's game on for Steffy and sally.\" Yes!",
        "Sally: Yes! See? This is the kind of P.R. Money can't buy. We are gonna have them lined up all the way down flower street for a look at what we have got strutting down the runway.",
        "Saul: Uh, but won't we have to, um...",
        "Sally: Spit it out, Saul.",
        "Saul: ...Make some dresses first?",
        "Sally: Only one. For each model. [Laughs]",
        "Eric: I wonder if the anxiety you sometimes feel doesn't come from the idea that we're not always gonna be the same way we are now. Things happen in this life that we can't really prevent, we can't protect each other from.",
        "Quinn: I get so afraid of losing you that I hold on too tight. And that's been my downfall in the past. And I made a mental note to myself not to do that again, but then... then there's this voice inside my head that says \"oh, Quinn, he could do so much better than you.\"",
        "Eric: No. Quinn, no. Don't do that.",
        "Quinn: And then I think to myself -- what would I do before I would ever let that happen?",
        "Katie: Eric has been a big part of all of our lives. I enjoy hanging out with him he's...stable. He makes me feel peaceful.",
        "Brooke: Is that all that you feel when you're with him?",
        "Katie: Yeah, you know, um... just because I think Quinn is a menace or at the very least, a wild card, that doesn't mean that I'm after her husband.",
        "Brooke: Of course not.",
        "Katie: What?",
        "Brooke: Nothing.",
        "Katie: I adore Eric. I always have. You know that. But that's it.",
        "Brooke: Okay.",
        "Katie: Okay.",
        "Brooke: Okay.",
        "Katie: Gosh.",
        "Thomas: I've seen the comment \"cat fight\" about 100 times.",
        "Steffy: Did you see her last post before she ambushed me?",
        "Nicole: 14 views. She's piggybacking on your popularity.",
        "Thomas: Mm-hmm, and giving us a master class on how it's done.",
        "Steffy: That bitch.",
        "Sally: I am a genius! Do I hear an argument?",
        "Shirley: No arguments here!",
        "Saul: You keep this up, and we will never have to advertise.",
        "Shirley: May I help you?",
        "Darlita: I didn't know you'd be so nice.",
        "Saul: Sally. Sally, this is Darlita. I thought you might want to interview some receptionist candidates.",
        "Sally: [Scoffs] Sorry. We're not hiring.",
        "Saul: Oh, no, I told Darlita about our profit-sharing plan.",
        "Sally: Okay, yeah, that's different.",
        "Darlita: Hi, Sal.",
        "Sally: Uh, Sal? Wow. No one's ever called me \"Sal\" before.",
        "Darlita: Well, I like to take shortcuts in life. Saves time. After all, time is honey.",
        "Sally: Honey. Wow, you are A...honey, aren't you?",
        "Darlita: Not so bad yourself, Sal. Hey. Hire any good-looking guys yet? 'Cause I'm always cooking.",
        "Sally: Well, if you're gonna work here, you got to keep your mind on your job.",
        "Darlita: I don't have a job.",
        "Shirley: And you're not gonna get one at this rate. Honey, the interview's over. Thank you so -- [Screams] Ohh!",
        "Darlita: Look, I may be no Einstein, but I am loyal like a dachshund. Hire me, and you will live to regret it. Hello? Sally spectra? Eye on fashion. I have a few questions.",
        "Sally: What the heck? Let's see how it goes. Let them in!",
        "Darlita: Does that mean I got it?",
        "Sally: Let them in!",
        "Darlita: Come on in, guys.",
        "Sally: Well, fire away. What do you want to know? Since when has spectra fashion been back in business?",
        "Sally: We never went away. My great aunt just took a little break, is all. And what about you? What do you know, besides getting yourself noticed? Picking a fight with Steffy Forrester -- that's straight out of your aunt's playbook. Tell us -- who are you, sally spectra?",
        "Brooke: So, I was dropping Katie and will off next door and thought I'd come over and catch up since Italy.",
        "Eric: That's great! I'm glad you did. How are you? How was the trip? How was Milan?",
        "Brooke: Oh, um...",
        "Eric: Brooke, Quinn stepped out for some air, all right? We're working from home today. It's okay. How it hope?",
        "Brooke: [Chuckles] She's great.",
        "Eric: Yeah.",
        "Brooke: How about you? You still a man of leisure these days?",
        "Eric: [Chuckles] Does it seem like that? Yeah, it's funny. When Stephanie first died, I could hardly bear to be in this house, and now I can hardly bear to leave it. It's great having my own life.",
        "Brooke: Sounds like Katie's in the same situation. Before her divorce, she was placating bill, and now she has her own house that she can decorate any way she wants. She has her child that she can raise any way she wants. And she has you. A neighbor that she adores and she knows she can count on. Don't tell her I told you this, but I think she's developing a crush on you.",
        "Eric: Oh, stop it.",
        "Brooke: [Giggles]",
        "Steffy: Ugh. What's done is done.",
        "Nicole: Yeah, people forget about this stuff in a matter of days.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Pam: She's at it again.",
        "Zende: Who?",
        "Pam: Check out eye on fashion's website.",
        "Sally: How do I look? Can I get everyone else in here with me? Look, we're not gonna see everyone. You're the interview.",
        "Sally: Well, you know what they say -- the medium is the message. Which has what to do with anything?",
        "Sally: Well, that is what spectra is all about -- for the normal people of the world. Not the rich, not the poverty-stricken -- that's what thrift stores are for -- but for all of us average Americans struggling to make ends meet with a little extra left over for buffalo wings and a brew or two on a Saturday night.",
        "Thomas: Got to admit, she talks a good game. Wasn't spectra best known for being disreputable?",
        "Sally: What's wrong with high fashion at discount prices? I think the problem was the discount quality.",
        "Sally: [Scoffs] Okay, see, this is what is wrong with all you media elites. Here you are, getting the scoop on the new shooting star of L.A. fashion... I'm pretty sure that's how we referred to Steffy Forrester last month.",
        "Sally: Oh, please! I'm gonna eat that Queenie for lunch! Forrester is so last century. Their couture line has gout from all their lobster and champagne. Come to our new re-grand opening preview. Bring your friends! Bring your mom and the kids! And when will that be?",
        "Sally: Oh, in just one little week. Get ready, Los Angeles! And you, too, queen Steffy. Spectra is back and better than ever.",
        "Steffy: Turn it off.",
        "Sally: Just a little sales talk, aunt sally, just in case you're listening.",
        "Thomas: She's hilarious.",
        "Pam: She doesn't think she's hilarious. She thinks she's Coco Chanel.",
        "Nicole: So, what are you gonna do?",
        "Steffy: I'm gonna tear that red hair out.",
        "Eric: You're making this up.",
        "Brooke: Would I lie to my oldest, dearest friend?",
        "Eric: I can't imagine Katie even using the word \"crush.\"",
        "Brooke: Well, maybe she didn't say that, but I know my sister.",
        "Eric: Uh-huh. And you know me. And you know that I appreciate any form of flattery.",
        "Brooke: [Chuckles]",
        "Eric: But I've known Katie forever, and I know that she only thinks of me as a long-time dear friend.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] Oh, Eric.",
        "Eric: Don't roll your eyes at me.",
        "Brooke: You are pitifully out of practice if you don't think women notice you or appreciate you.",
        "Eric: [Laughing] Brooke, I don't believe for one second that Katie would harbor unsuitable intentions towards a married man.",
        "Brooke: Yeah, I don't think she would, but... if you could just read between the lines.",
        "Eric: \"Between the lines?\"",
        "Brooke: Quinn. Your wife. You love your wife, right?",
        "Eric: Yes. I do. I love my wife.",
        "Brooke: And you think she's changed.",
        "Eric: I do. She has. I see it every day.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs] Well, that's lovely of you, Eric. I mean, a lot of us don't believe that, but we want you to be happy so we hold our tongues. All I'm saying is... if you think you only have two options, Quinn or loneliness, think again.",
        "Katie: I did not kiss Eric, Quinn.",
        "Quinn: I saw you. Before Eric went upstairs. You didn't know I was there.",
        "Katie: We don't have to make this into a big deal, okay? It's not a big deal, and I'm -- it won't happen again. It was a friendly kiss. And I'm sorry if you found it inappropriate.",
        "Quinn: I'm so disappointed in you, Katie.",
        "Katie: [Scoffs]",
        "Quinn: I was hoping that we could, you know, be friendly. You said that you would respect my home, but as soon as you moved in here, you went over there to spend time alone with my husband, and I'm just wondering -- what else is going on?",
        "Katie: Nothing else is going on.",
        "Quinn: Okay. So you and Eric are just friends.",
        "Katie: Yes.",
        "Eric: I think you're still suffering jet lag. You need to go home and get some rest, come on.",
        "Brooke: [Laughs] Oh, my -- yeah, you know what, you're probably right. Okay. Okay.",
        "Eric: Thanks for coming by. I really appreciate it.",
        "Brooke: All right. Thank you. It was good to see you.",
        "Eric: Good night, sweetie.",
        "Brooke: Don't forget what I said. [Gasps]",
        "Quinn: You tell your sister I'll be watching her."
