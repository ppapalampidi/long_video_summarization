        "Cleo: Recently.",
        "Gwen: Why didn't you say anything to me?",
        "Cleo: Because -- because you weren't here, and I actually don't know where you usually keep those.",
        "Gwen: I would never leave these on the couch. I always put them back in this box.",
        "Cleo: You know what -- it's probably all my fault. You probably put them on the end table, and I knocked them into the couch cushion when I was cleaning -- I'm such a big klutz like that. Gwen, I don't -- I don't want you to -- I would never steal from you or will. I mean, you both have been so good to me.",
        "Gwen: I have to get going.",
        "Cleo: Come on -- now I've gone and upset you on your big day. I mean, you've got to just shake it off, okay? You're meeting with a music producer. You're going to be great. You're a star. You were born to be, okay?",
        "Gwen: Thank you for finding the earrings, cleo.",
        "Cleo: I didn't put those earrings in this bag. And I know that gwen didn't either. Somebody doesn't want me here.",

        "Cop #1: We need more information.",
        "Dusty: What more do you need to know? The guy's name is lance barton. He's probably in the er right now. Let's not, you know, bother miss stewart anymore than we need to.",

        "Cop #2: Don't leave town. We may need more information from you.",
        "Dusty: Right. Well, we can't leave town, but we can get another room.",
        "Alison: I can't go out like this -- I have to get the rest of the blood off me.",
        "Dusty: You got it all off in the shower.",
        "Alison: No, no -- I didn'T. There's still some left. I can feel it on my skin.",
        "Dusty: You're going to be fine. I'm going to call your sister and tell her you're okay.",
        "Alison: No, don't call emily. You can't call her.",
        "(Announcer) let nothing stop you in the pursuit of your passion.",
        "Dusty: If I don't call your sister, she's going to worry. Is that what you want?",
        "Alison: I don't want her to know. You can't tell her what I did.",
        "Dusty: You defended yourself. You did nothing wrong.",
        "Alison: Please, dusty, don't call her. Please.",
        "Dusty: Ali, why are you so scared?",
        "Alison: When I found out about -- that she had been a prostitute -- I said terrible things. I judged her! And what am I? A porn actress who attacked her scuzzy producer --",
        "Dusty: Get some sleep, okay? Lance is going to be caught by the time you wake up.",
        "Alison: I can't sleep. I have to get his blood off of me. I need to take another shower.",
        "Dusty: Alison --",
        "Alison: I can't get clean. I just need to get clean.",
        "Meg: I am so sorry I couldn't reach you. But when craig wanted to change the date, I thought, hey, why not? We could get this done with, right?",
        "Paul: The sooner it starts, the sooner it's over. Okay, you want to hear my big plan?",
        "Meg: Yeah, tell me.",
        "Paul: All right. As soon as you say your vowels, the minister will say to craig that he may kiss the bride and then you run. You run. There's a door right there, and you just go out the door -- it's to a back entrance, and I'll be waiting for you. I'll have the motor running.",
        "Meg: You want me to run with miles of satin and a veil?",
        "Paul: Is that going to be a problem?",
        "Meg: I think he's gonna chase me. And I think he's gonna catch me.",
        "Paul: Yeah?",
        "Meg: Yeah.",
        "Paul: Got a better idea?",
        "Meg: I can't sneak away right after the ceremony -- I think it'll be safer if I sneak out during the reception when there's a lot more distraction.",
        "Paul: Okay. Then we'll go straight to the airport? I'll whisk you away to your new life.",
        "Meg: And where will we live our new life?",
        "Paul: An island, off the coast of sicily.",
        "Meg: What about lucinda? What about the terms of the contract?",
        "Paul: I had a lawyer go over it word for word and nowhere does it stipulate how long you have to be married to craig -- there's no fine print. As soon as you say your vowels, you're in control of worldwide.",
        "Meg: And how do I transfer it to lucinda?",
        "Paul: By italian fax. And then you get an annulment. And then we have a wedding. Meg, we have a real wedding.",
        "Meg: Unless you have more visions of a screaming bride -- then I'll have to reconsider.",
        "Paul: Oh, no -- no worries. Nothing like that's happened to me since I took care of the rings. I got rid of them.",
        "Margo: Oh, have you got the rings?",
        "Craig: Oh, done. You want to see them -- take a look.",
        "Margo: Wow, those are really gorgeous. Where'd you get those?",
        "Craig: In old town.",
        "Margo: Yeah, they look like antiques?",
        "Craig: Yeah, I think they're from the early 1900s. I just loved their simplicity. And I just happened to see these in the window the same day that the jeweler got them.",
        "Margo: You are a lucky man, craig.",
        "Craig: Indeed I am.",
        "Meg: You got rid of the rings you picked out for us last year? You mean, you just threw them out?",
        "Paul: No, I took them back to the jeweler -- the jeweler in old town.",
        "Meg: And you're not worried that something bad will happen to the next poor couple that purchases them --",
        "Paul: Nothing bad's going to happen to anybody. Those rings are just bad luck for us. But now, bad luck is a thing of the past for you and me.",
        "Meg: I hope so. Cause I don't have it in me to call off another wedding. You know, leaving you at the altar was the hardest thing I had ever done. I wanted to be your wife so badly.",
        "Paul: I'm sorry I hurt you. I won't ever hurt you like that again. I am having another vision, you know.",
        "Meg: Who's in it?",
        "Paul: You and me. On our island, far away from everyone and everything.",
        "Meg: What else do you see?",
        "Paul: Us building a life -- a life forever.",
        "Craig: These are from a gentleman who brought them back from a wedding that had been cancelled.",
        "Margo: Don't tell me that --",
        "Craig: The jeweler had just gotten them back that day.",
        "Margo: Did you get the big, bad vibe discount too?",
        "Craig: Oh, come on. Knock that off. Stop that -- I don't do superstitious stuff like that with this.",
        "Margo: Yeah, well what about meg?",
        "Craig: Well meg doesn't know, and you're not gonna tell her.",
        "Margo: You've gotta tell her. You've got to tell her. Every woman has a right to know that she's wearing bad luck rings.",
        "Craig: Fine, I'll tell her.",
        "Margo: When?",
        "Craig: Fifth anniversary. Tenth at the latest. Margo, come on. I couldn't pass these up. These are one of a kind. These are perfect for meg -- they're elegant, they're classy and I can't wait to give them to her. Come on -- look at them. Aren't they incredible?",
        "Margo: You know, I think you really are in love.",
        "Craig: Come on, let's get to the church. Meg's waiting.",
        "Paul: No, no, no, not yet. Not yet. One more minute.",
        "Meg: I can'T. What if craig finds us here and then --",
        "Paul: You can just, you know, kick me in the shins, pretend you were trying to push me away.",
        "Meg: That's not going to work. Not anymore.",
        "Paul: Sure it will.",
        "Meg: Craig's not blind. One look at the two of us together and how could he not know how I feel about you? How could anyone look at me and not see how much I love you?",

        "Craig: You don't like them. I did something wrong. Is it the colors or something?",
        "Meg: No, no, everything is perfect. You know, I'm just being a nervous bride. Did you get the rings?",
        "Craig: Yeah, it's done.",
        "Meg: And how about the contract? You know, we need to deal with that.",
        "Craig: Yeah, we will, we will.",
        "Meg: You're sure your attorney has enough time now that you moved the wedding?",
        "Craig: Yeah, yes, absolutely plenty of time.",
        "Meg: Before we take our vows?",
        "Craig: Okay, you know, what's going on? Is there something wrong? What is this about?",
        "Minister: Oh, you're here. Shall we begin?",
        "Craig: Yeah, I think we're ready. Do you?",
        "Meg: I do.",
        "Cleo: Jade?",
        "Jade: Cleo. What are you still doing in town?",
        "Cleo: I need to talk to you about something.",
        "Jade: Well, I'm busy.",
        "Cleo: No, you're not. This isn't your busy day. I remember that, just like I remembered you take aerobics right over there, and how you like to work out in the morning because it's better for your metabolism. If this isn't a good time, though, I mean, I could come find you later when you're getting your hair done or when you're hanging out with your cousin at woak.",
        "Jade: What do you want, cleo? You were supposed to leave town weeks ago. I even gave you money for a bus ticket.",
        "Cleo: I know and I'll pay you back, I promise. I have a job now and everything.",
        "Jade: You're working here? Why?",
        "Cleo: Because I like it here.",
        "Jade: Where are you staying?",
        "Cleo: Is that some kind of trick question, because I'm pretty sure you know where I'm staying, just like I'm pretty sure you know that I never left town.",
        "Jade: How would I know that?",
        "Cleo: I don't know. Maybe you found out from your cousin, luke, who I just met, by the way. And I don't understand why you're so mad at me.",
        "Jade: Well, cleo, in order to be mad at you, I'd have to think about you, which I don'T.",
        "Cleo: Really? Because you seem like a pretty angry girl. I mean, you're angry enough to go and take gwen's earrings and put 'em in my backpack to make it look like I stole them.",
        "Jade: Wow, you have a pretty amazing fantasy life, don't you, cleo?",
        "Cleo: I need you to stop being mad at me, okay? I need you to stop doing things that are gonna make gwen and will mad at me, because they're the second best friends that I've ever had. Do you want to know who my very first best friend was?",
        "Jade: I don't know. Some equally weird girl from turlock, california?",
        "Cleo: No. You, jade. You were my very first best friend, and that's really, honestly, because you introduced me to will and gwen. I can never thank you enough for that. I promise I'll never tell them that you brought me here to break up their marriage. So, why can't you just leave me alone?",
        "Jade: Because I don't believe a word you say.",
        "Craig: Look, you know, if you're feeling overwhelmed, I mean, I can pick up some of the details and --",
        "Meg: No, no, everything is amazing. You've already done so much. I'm excited, I guess.",
        "Craig: And a little sad.",
        "Meg: I'm fine.",
        "Craig: It would be better if lily was your matron of honor.",
        "Meg: That would have been nice, but it's okay. Really.",
        "Craig: Meg, I know that your family is staying away because of me, and I'm very sorry. I wish there was something I could do to make that better.",
        "Margo: But, you know what? After tonight, you'll be a member of our family.",
        "Meg: Thanks, margo.",
        "Craig: Well, I guess we should get going. You know, check on the details of the reception?",
        "Meg: You know, I do know one thing that would smooth things over for lucinda and lily, at least.",
        "Craig: The contract?",
        "Meg: Well, lucinda is gonna be a bundle of nerves, you know, and she'll be impossible until everything's in order --",
        "Craig: Yeah, I understand that we don't want to do anything that might risk her ruining our wedding. I'll have it signed and sealed before we take the vows, all right?",
        "Meg: Thank you.",
        "Craig: We'll walk you out.",
        "Meg: You know, I'm gonna sit here for a few minutes.",
        "Craig: Do you want some company?",
        "Meg: No, I'm just gonna enjoy the flowers and the church. It's all gonna go by so fast. I just want to enjoy it a little bit more.",
        "Margo: So if you need anything, you'll call me.",
        "Meg: Thank you, margo, yeah. Thanks. What, what is it?",
        "Craig: I know you're nervous. And with my track record, you have every right to be. I want you to know that no one could love you like I do, and I promise you -- you won't be sorry that you married me.",
        "Dusty: Emily, I was hoping to talk to you and not your voice mail, but anyway, I found alison. She's okay. We'll probably be in vegas one more day. I'll call you later. Alison, I ordered some breakfast and it's here. Alison? Hey, ali- cat?",
        "Alison: It won't come off. The blood, I can't get it off. I can't make it stop, it's everywhere! I can't get rid of it. It just -- it won't go away.",
        "Dusty: Alison, you're gonna be okay.",
        "Alison: No, no! Don't come in here! Stay away! It's gonna get on you! Can't you see it? No, no, I need to get it off!",
        "Dusty: Stop. Hey, stop, all right? E look at me. Look at me. You got all the blood off.",
        "Alison: No --",
        "Dusty: Yes, look at me. It's gone. Hey, there's none on me, is there? It's gone, you got it all. It's gone.",
        "Alison: It's gone.",
        "Dusty: Yeah.",
        "Alison: It's gone.",
        "Dusty: All the bad stuff is gone. It's all right.",
        "Alison: I don't know what's wrong with me. No matter how much you tell me it's not there, I still see lance's blood on me. Why?",
        "Dusty: Drink this.",
        "Alison: What is it?",
        "Dusty: Tea. It'll warm you up.",
        "Alison: What's happening to me, dusty?",
        "Dusty: Sometimes, after withdrawal you can have anxiety, you know, paranoia.",
        "Alison: Hallucinations?",
        "Dusty: Sometimes.",
        "Alison: I've heard people talk about it in meetings, but i didn't use meth that long, so I didn't think it would happen.",
        "Dusty: Neither did my wife. The same thing happened to her. Panic attacks.",
        "Alison: But it goes away?",
        "Dusty: Hers did.",
        "Alison: How?",
        "Dusty: Time.",
        "Alison: But when she was in the middle of it and it all still seemed so real, did you give her tea, too?",
        "Dusty: Yeah.",
        "Alison: And it made everything okay?",
        "Dusty: Try to sleep.",
        "Alison: I don't think I can.",
        "Dusty: Well, try. You've got to close your eyes first of all. Come on, let's do it. Close your eyes. Think about good things.",
        "Alison: I keep seeing lance and his blood.",
        "Dusty: Come on. Think about somebody you love. Okay? Relax. Think about someone you love and hold that thought.",
        "Cleo: Look, I guess it's my fault for not leaving town when you told me to, but one thing just kind of led to the next, and everything started working out for will and gwen. And, I don't want to brag, but the whole reason that gwen is singing again is really because of me. She's gonna become a huge star and leave all this behind.",
        "Jade: And you did that all for her?",
        "Cleo: Yeah, of course, 'cause will and gwen mean a lot to me. They're my second best friends.",
        "Jade: Yes, your second very best friends. I got that part.",
        "Cleo: And even though you've done a lot for me, jade, if you do things like go into their house and mess around with their stuff, like gwen's earrings, I mean, that could be a real problem, you know?",
        "Jade: I told you I didn't do anything.",
        "Cleo: It had to be you. You're the only one who's mad at me. You're the only one who's mad at will and gwen, and they're my friends, and what you're doing is wrong and you have to stop, okay? I mean it.",
        "Jade: You better not be threatening me, cleo. Are you?",
        "Craig: Tremendous, fritz. You've done a great job. Thank you very much.",
        "Concierge: My pleasure to be of service, sir.",
        "Craig: Okay.",
        "Margo: Well, the limo's all ready and waiting. Can't wait to start your honeymoon, huh?",
        "Craig: Yeah, well, there's a reason for that. Meg has chosen to go the more traditional, no-sex-before-the-ceremony route.",
        "Margo: Well, no wonder you pushed up the date, huh?",
        "Craig: Yeah, well, it gave me some incentive. Do you think it's too early for champagne?",
        "Margo: Yeah, we're gonna have a cup of coffee.",
        "Craig: Oh, man. Are we gonna have a serious discussion?",
        "Margo: Yeah, yeah. Look, I haven't seen much of your relationship with meg until today, and something bothers me.",
        "Craig: No, I know, I know. She was very, very distracted at the church. It's just pre-wedding jitters.",
        "Margo: She flinched when you tried to kiss her.",
        "Craig: No, she didn'T.",
        "Margo: Yes, she did. Who are you talking to? This is your sister. I'm a detective, I'm a trained observer. She flinched.",
        "Craig: Okay, okay. She's got a lot on her mind, I guess.",
        "Margo: Well, I just don't think she's as attracted to you as she might be, as a blushing bride might be.",
        "Craig: No, no. Okay, you know what? The no-sex thing, this is a very recent development. Trust me, meg's attracted to me, both in bed and out.",
        "Margo: Craig, craig, craig. I'm worried about you.",
        "Craig: Don't be.",
        "Margo: What do you think is gonna to happen? Do you think you're gonna get married and she'll wake up out of the blue one day and say, \"I love you\"?",
        "Craig: I can be pretty irresistibly adorable when I put my mind to it.",
        "Margo: Honey, listen -- this marriage might be a love match for you, but for meg it screams business arrangement.",
        "Meg: One other thing to remember is that craig has never forced me to do anything, so if we're alone and he tries something, I'll just say no.",
        "Paul: Right.",
        "Meg: Right.",
        "Paul: Are you sure you can do it?",
        "Meg: Leave craig?",
        "Paul: No, no, no, not leave craig. Leave this town. Leave your family?",
        "Meg: I'll miss everyone terribly, but you'll miss your family, too.",
        "Paul: I stopped missing my family a long time ago, when my mother married craig. That was when I decided that I would never get hurt again. And I hurt a lot of other people. I destroyed rose, right here in this church. I hurt jennifer. I'm not gonna miss this town. I'm certainly not gonna miss who I've turned into being here.",
        "Meg: What are you saying?",
        "Paul: Forget the plan. Forget lucinda's business. Getting revenge, getting even with craig -- forget it all -- and come away with me now. Leave with me, right now. Oh, oh, oh, it's magic",
        "Cleo: All I'm saying is that you shouldn't break into people's houses. It's just wrong. So don't do it anymore, okay?",
        "Jade: You're amazing.",
        "Cleo: I am?",
        "Jade: You know what? If gwen and will are actually dumb enough to believe that you're their friend, they deserve every rotten thing you're going to do them.",
        "Cleo: I would never hurt them!",
        "Jade: Right.",
        "Cleo: I mean it!",
        "Jade: You know what, maybe you can fool gwen and will into believing that you're just some simpleton nerd, but you can't fool me, cleo. I know the real you.",
        "Craig: I know meg doesn't love me.",
        "Margo: Then why are you marrying her?",
        "Craig: She's an honorable person. And I can't believe that she would take this step without thinking that in time, maybe she could -- love me. It's a start, isn't it, margo?",
        "Margo: I hope you're right.",
        "Meg: You know, more than anything -- I want to leave with you right now and never look back.",
        "Paul: Then great, let's go. Come on.",
        "Meg: No, no, no, no. I can'T. I can'T.",
        "Paul: Yeah, you can.",
        "Meg: I've put too much into this, paul. I have to see it through.",
        "Paul: No you don'T.",
        "Meg: I do. I need to get through just a few more hours. Just a few hours. For lucinda. For lily.",
        "Paul: I don't want you anywhere near craig.",
        "Meg: Here. Take this. And keep it with you. It was my grandmother'S.",
        "Paul: It's beautiful. Thank you.",
        "Meg: You know, I thought I'd lost it. And then I opened up a drawer today, and there it was. And I knew it was a sign. I just didn't know what it meant.",
        "Paul: Now you do?",
        "Meg: I thought I had lost you, paul. But here you are today, more precious to me than ever. I will get through these next few hours, and I will come back to you -- and I will be your wife, paul ryan. This I promise you.",
        "Paul: And I'll be waiting for you. And I'll take you far away from craig. And everything else. And I will be your husband, meg snyder. That's my promise.",
        "Announcer: On the next \"as the world turns\" --",
        "Emily: Aaron snyder, what are you doing?",
        "Alison: I was dreaming that you and I were making love and -- it wasn't a dream.",
        "Carly: If you're sending him away because of what happened to faith -- what if parker had nothing to do with it?",
        "Will: You told me you didn't know who jade taylor was. I saw you two talking and it didn't look like you were strangers."
