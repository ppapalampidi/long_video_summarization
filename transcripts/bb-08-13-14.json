        "Deacon: Think about that diamond he gave her. They're gonna be great together.",
        "Brooke: How do you know?",
        "Deacon: Because she's our daughter. She's got a great head on her shoulders. I mean, nothing gets by her. Look, granted, okay, Wyatt is slick, but he loves her, okay? You don't just give a girl a-a two-ton rock like that if you're not crazy about her. He's gonna treat her well... same as I'll treat you.",
        "Brooke: [Sighs]",
        "Deacon: Brooke, listen to me. Together, we made the most beautiful thing in my life, all right? I mean, the fact that you went back to Ridge, that was a mistake. And forget about Spencer. Look, I can be the guy that you're proud of. Completely committed, always, always loyal to you. I mean, our daughter's married now. Wouldn't it be great if she could come home and see her parents together? I-I know. Maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. But, I mean, a guy can dream, right? And I do dream.

        "Ivy: [Sighs]",
        "Liam: I just -- I have to find her. That's -- I have to find her.",
        "Ivy: Okay. Okay, well, then let's go.",
        "Liam: Yeah? O-okay.",

        "Wyatt: You know...",
        "[Both chuckle] Mr. Spencer, miss Logan, when I awoke this morning in this beautiful port of call, I had no idea what my day would hold. Then I got your call expressing that there would be a marriage on this ship. Suddenly, my day changed dramatically. I cannot imagine a more beautiful setting for this event -- the splendor of Monte Carlo, the sea, this beautiful yacht. I have no doubt it will live long in your memory. Mr. Spencer?",
