        "Cassie: It's a long story. A really long story.",
        "Jeffrey: So what's she doing here?",
        "Dinah: She has a name. And to answer your question, i'm living here now.",
        "Cassie: It's true.",
        "Dinah: Would you like to tell him or should I?",
        "Cassie: I'd like for you to deal with the flowers, okay.",
        "Dinah: Okay.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, I know you might be feeling a little lonely, but if you are, get a dog.",
        "Cassie: You're going to have to have a little more respect for dinah, because she's carrying my child.",
        "Jeffrey: You've lost me.",
        "Cassie: Have I? I can't imagine why. I mean it makes perfect sense to me.",
        "Jeffrey: Cassie, I don'T...",
        "Cassie: When I found out about edmund starting the fire and I took off, it was right in the middle of our in vitro process if you remember. See my eggs have already been fertilized. They were ready to be implanted. See edmund saw it as a now or never opportunity, or maybe some messed up way of getting me back. So he had my embryos implanted in somebody else.",
        "Jeffrey: Not her.",
        "Cassie: Dinah. It's dinah.",
        "Jeffrey: Is edmund completely insane? What a stupid question. Of course he is. Come here. What are you going to do?",
        "Cassie: I'm doing it.",
        "Jeffrey: Dinah marler, the mother of your child?",
        "Cassie: No, gestational carrier. I'm the mother. That's my egg, my gene, my baby. Okay, look, I... ( Crying ) am i happy about this? No! I can't believe edmund did this. But that's my baby that she's carrying. I mean, it's a baby that i already love, jeffrey.",
        "Jeffrey: Okay, cassie, now wait a minute. Think about this, okay. Okay. The baby's born then what? You think dinah's just going to hand him or her over to you just like that before she crawls back in her hole?",
        "Dinah: Oh, do you think i can't hear you?",
        "Cassie: Edmund made her sign a contract. Okay, it's the only smart thing that he did.",
        "Jeffrey: A contract? She could have that contested for any number of reasons. I can tell you that as a lawyer.",
        "Cassie: Don't tell me that.",
        "Jeffrey: Dinah hates you. She will use this child to torture you. She's has already started.",
        "Dinah: That's enough, jeffrey. Now I know that you have a thing here for cassie. And I don't know how far it's gone. In fact, i don't want to know. But I think you need to take your selfish needs and put them aside and focus on what's best for this baby. So either you get on the happy train, or you get lost.",
        "Tammy: Is mom back at the farm? I haven't gotten in touch with her, but the front desk said you were here.",
        "Edmund: Yes, tammy, your mother's at the farm and i am here. And we're living separately for the time being while we work things out.",
        "Tammy: If you could work things out. I've got to go. Sandy.",
        "Sandy: What's cooking good looking? So, you want to eat here? Or go someplace else like that new place on the beach?",

        "Tony: Okay, i'm sorry. I didn't mean to. I feel... You know what? You want to do it someplace else, we can do it anywhere you want. That's fine.",
        "Michelle: Oh, yeah. Where? What do you got?",
        "Tony: Let's say towers, your family's backyard. Or outdoors, laurel falls. It's up to you. You know what? Listen. I'm sorry. I'm just... I'm just so excited about this whole thing. I'm throwing it all at you and i apologize. It's whevever you want. Anything you want. Hey.",
        "Michelle: Mm-hmm.",
        "Tony: You all right?",
        "Michelle: Can we talk about this later on tonight?",
        "Tony: Yeah, that's fine. Yeah, sure.",
        "Michelle: Okay.",

        "Marina: Well, i understand, danny, i do. I wasn't trying to be snarky about it.",
        "Danny: No, you weren'T. You weren'T.",
        "Marina: It's just that... I was just looking forward to the trip.",
        "Danny: I was, too.",
        "Marina: Not just the trip.",
        "Danny: I know. I know.",
        "Marina: Just being with you.",

        "Marina: Are you sure? Because...",
        "Danny: The... Yeah.",
        "Marina: Here we are, danny. We're standing in the same spot where you married michelle, and she remembers it now. She remembers how much you loved her?",

        "Olivia: You should have thought about that before you slept with harley.",
        "Bill: Well, you should have thought about that before you tried to blackmail my father, sold out lewis construction, turn your back on harley. Should i go on? Look, I'm talking having to forget each other mistakes or even forgive. But wherever, can't we just be there together?",
        "Alan: I'm sorry to intrude, hilda wanted to know if you and emma were happy in your suite, olivia. If not, she'll be happy to move rooms.",

        "Bill: Look, the reason I came here was to...",
        "Olivia: To blame alan for everything's that's gone wrong between us. I got that. But that's not it. It's not his fault. This is about you and me and how we keep hurting each other.",
        "Bill: Okay, wait a minute. You honestly believe that you would be happier living here with people that would betray you at the drop of a hat?",

        "Danny: Not very original.",
        "Michelle: Well, don't worry, I have veto power. I know that wouldn't be appropriate. Tony and i will definitely find someplace personal for us to get married.",

        "Marina: He just wants to help her, with robbie and stuff like that.",
        "Tony: Ah. Well, I'm glad to hear that because michelle and i are getting married. We're planning our wedding as we speak. Okay, what are we going to do? Are we going to sit here and do this song and dance over and over again and play this game? Or, are we going to admit that we're both in the same boat?",
        "Marina: What boat is that?",
        "Tony: You know what boat, marina. Oh. Okay, well, I guess it doesn't matter to you that i got danny and michelle's divorce hearing pushed up. Tomorrow morning. Yeah, that's right. You're welcome.",
        "Cassie: I didn't make the appointment for myself, dr. Sedwick. Dinah is carrying my child.",

        "Dinah: It is, i know. I know.",
        "Cassie: I know how unorthodox this is, and i'm sorry that we're just kind of springing it on you.",
        "Dr. Sedwick: Babies come into the world all sorts of ways, and i certainly know how hard you and edmund have tried. Oh, will he be joining us?",
        "Cassie: No. Uh-uh. He has a meeting.",
        "Dr. Sedwick: Oh. And you're here to...",
        "Jeffrey: I'm just a friend.",
        "Dr. Sedwick: Oh. Well, dinah, why don't you come along with me? And I'll be back and let you know when we have everything set up.",
        "Cassie: Okay. Oh, man.",
        "Jeffrey: It's going to be a long nine months.",
        "Cassie: Yeah. Yeah, I don't know. I think the saint dinah is almost as bad as the old dinah.",
        "Jeffrey: There is no old dinah or new dinah. There's just the same leopard who won't change her spots.",
        "Dinah: Thank you. ( Cell phone rings )",
        "edmund: Hello?",
        "Dinah: Edmund. You need to be here, now.",
        "bill: All right, you are going to tell alan that you're not taking this job, olivia.",
        "Olivia: No, no. I want the job.",
        "Bill: You want the job?",
        "Olivia: Mm-hmm.",
        "Bill: He just told you to take over my family's company.",
        "Olivia: No. No, he said it was my call.",
        "Bill: And that is a test, olivia. It's a test. If you don't take over lewis, then you fail the test. You're disloyal to alan and he gives you the boot. Don't you understand? He gave you that file in front of me because he wants you to choose between us. Don't let him win. Come on, olivia. I want us to win.",
        "Olivia: On your terms.",
        "Bill: No, that'S...",
        "Olivia: Yes! Listen to me. You... You get to perjure yourself for harley, you get to build houses for her, you even get to sleep with her! And I have to be a saint or I'm selfish? I have to give up everything that i have worked long and hard for? You have to give up nothing? That is no deal for me, bill.",
        "Bill: That's no deal?",
        "Olivia: No.",
        "Bill: Oh, there it is. There it is. There's that shark that I fell in love with. So you really want to go up against me on this, huh? Head to head?",
        "Olivia: And may the best man win.",
        "Bill: Trust me, i will.",
        "Cassie: ( Sighs ) what are you doing here?",
        "Edmund: Shouldn't i be asking him that question?",
        "Cassie: Look, jeffrey came by the house and he saw dinah, so i told him what happened.",
        "Jeffrey: It was a nice stunt, edmund. I'll have to review the case law, see how many you broke this time.",
        "Edmund: I'm not sure you'd have the time, mr. O'neill. Riding to cassie's rescue every two seconds must be awfully time-consuming.",
        "Jeffrey: Yeah, like going behind her back. That takes time, too, but you managed to pull it off, right?",
        "Edmund: I know how much she wanted this child.",
        "Cassie: Okay, can we please stop? Jeffrey, can you leave? Edmund's the father, and i can cut him out of some things, but not everything, and he has a right to be here. Please.",
        "Jeffrey: ( Sighs ) all right. Call me if you need me.",
        "Cassie: I will. I have your cell number. Thank you.",
        "Edmund: Unbelievable, his bullying his way in here like that.",
        "Cassie: Bullying would be fertilizing my eggs and implanting them in dinah. That would be bullying.",
        "Edmund: If you don't want this child, cassie, then tell me.",
        "Cassie: Well, of course i want the child now, edmund.",
        "Edmund: Then stop saying i made a mistake.",
        "Dr. Sedwick: Edmund, I'm so glad you're here. Well, why don't you both come in together, and you can have a look. See that shape right there?",
        "Edmund: Is that...?",
        "Dr. Sedwick: Your child.",
        "Cassie: Oh, my god.",
        "Tammy: You're leaving town?",
        "Sandy: You need help packing?",
        "Tammy: Sandy.",
        "Sandy: He's doing the right thing, tammy. And it's about time.",
        "Jonathan: Gee, thanks. I live for your approval.",
        "Sandy: You hate it here. You've made that abundantly clear from day one. You can still have a relationship with reva. She can go visit you wherever.",
        "Jonathan: Yeah, well, not unless she gets her psychic powers back because I'm not telling her where I'm going.",
        "Tammy: Wait. What? You're not telling reva? What do you mean? She's your mom. You love her.",
        "Sandy: Let's not get carried away.",
        "Tammy: And more importantly, she loves you. If you leave her like that, it'll crush her.",
        "Sandy: Yeah, tammy's right about that. You shouldn't do this to reva.",
        "Jonathan: Did you ever think maybe my staying would hurt reva? Did you ever think about that?",
        "Sandy: Let me ask you a question: Has this been the plan from the beginning? You get close to reva, you make her think you care, and then you just rip her heart out and crush her for good? Is that really your master plan?",
        "Tony: Okay, come on, marina. You know you want this divorce to go on just as much as i do.",
        "Marina: Sure, i want the divorce to go on, tony, but that's just because it's what danny wants.",
        "Tony: And you're sure about that, huh?",
        "Marina: If you have something to say, just say it.",
        "Tony: Okay, i will. I don't think that you're as sure of danny's feelings as you say you are, okay? Hey, i think you're a great girl, I think you're beautiful, I think that you would make danny very happy if he really gave you the chance. But the fact is, is that he's so obsessed with michelle, so it doesn't matter.",
        "Marina: You are the one who's obsessed, tony. And you have to chill, okay, or you're going to ruin your chance for a relationship with michelle.",
        "Tony: Let me tell you something. Let me tell you something. Michelle and i are fine. We're getting married. Okay? Now, you do your part. Next 24 hours, you keep danny busy. You make sure you show him how good of a person you really are and how good you guys are together. You make sure he shows up at the courthouse, signs the papers, and we go about our happy ending. Okay? Deal, partner?",
        "Marina: I'm not your partner.",
        "Tony: Oh, yeah, you are. You just don't want to admit it.",
        "Michelle: So tomorrow morning we just sign those papers, and then it's official. Oh, man, and two years ago on the fourth of july, we got married right here. Do you remember that day? Do you remember how crazy that was? We were running around trying to find a justice of the peace to marry us. Then we realized we couldn't even go through with it because we needed our friends and family there.",
        "Danny: Yes, michelle, i remember. ( Laughs )",
        "michelle: And last fourth of july couldn't have been more opposite. I was so angry.",
        "Danny: Over an apple pie.",
        "Michelle: No, i was angry because I couldn't remember things that pele were expecting me to remember. And I... I took it out on you on our anniversary. I'm really, really sorry about that. I'm sorry that i hurt you like that.",
        "Danny: Hey. In the past.",
        "Michelle: Yeah. Yeah, we can't really undo the past anyway, right?",
        "Danny: I guess not.",
        "Michelle: ( Sighs )",
        "danny: What, are you cold? You want my coat?",
        "Michelle: It's all right. I'm fine.",
        "Danny: No, here. Here, here, here. Take it. Take it.",
        "Alan: I hope I didn't cause any trouble between you and bill, olivia, because you don't have to take this job.",
        "Olivia: You know I want it.",
        "Alan: Well, i'm delighted to hear that because I think you're going to be perfect in it.",
        "Bill: Okay, i've had it. Enough is enough. Hey, wanda. Yeah, it's bill. You heard, huh? Yeah, I'm back. Well, listen i want to pull everyone together. I want to hold a meeting. Yeah, very important. Okay, yep, that'll work. Fine. Okay, see you then. Thank you very much. If that's the way you want to play it, olivia, that's the way we play it. No more mr. Nice guy.",
        "Tammy: What's got you so freaked out?",
        "Sandy: What, are you in trouble or something?",
        "Jonathan: Oh, come on. When have you ever known me to be afraid of trouble, sandy?",
        "Sandy: Never. And you're acting afraid right now.",
        "Jonathan: No. You're just afraid you're going to miss me when I'm gone.",
        "Sandy: Believe me, I won'T. I just don't want you to hurt reva.",
        "Tammy: Especially not right now.",
        "Sandy: She needs us all right now, even you. As much as i hate to admit it, especially you.",
        "Jonathan: Okay. I'll stay. Okay. Be careful what you wish for.",
        "Tammy: Thank you, jonathan. I know you don't want to hurt aunt reva.",
        "Jonathan: It's not me she has to worry about.",
        "Edmund: Is that the baby?",
        "Dr. Sedwick: Mm-hmm. Right there.",
        "Edmund: It's amazing.",
        "Cassie: Is everything okay so far?",
        "Dr. Sedwick: Oh, it's too early to see too much detail, but it looks good to me.",
        "Dinah: It's amazing that this life is growing inside of me.",
        "Dr. Sedwick: Now, do you two have any other questions?",
        "Cassie: No, no. We're fine.",
        "Dr. Sedwick: Well, you can get dressed now. Co\u00fa\u00e7 you can call janet, and she'll set up your next appointment. So i'll see the two of you soon, hmm? And congratulations.",
