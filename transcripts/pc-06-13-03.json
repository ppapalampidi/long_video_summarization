        "Refusing to let Rafe put him off, Ian knocks him out and carries him to the hospital, where he fills Chris in on his latest plan. Chris is uneasy with the idea of doing the procedure on Rafe, who obviously hasn't given his consent. Rafe is struggling to regain consciousness, and obviously has other plans. Ian insists that saving Lucy is the most important thing that Rafe could possibly do at the moment. Kevin resists Elizabeth's efforts to make him comfortable while he awaits his next injection. Karen brings the drug, but Kevin becomes very angry when he sees how little he's about to receive. An argument between Elizabeth and Karen ensues, and they take it outside, where Elizabeth accuses Karen of using Kevin's misfortune to put the moves on him. Karen threatens to have Elizabeth thrown out if she refuses to leave the hospital willingly. While Karen is distracted, Kevin takes the opportunity to prepare a larger dose for himself. Karen returns and catches him before he can go through with it. They argue about Kevin's need to get off the drug. Kevin finally gives in, filled with remorse about what he's done. Elizabeth returns and misinterprets what she sees happening between Kevin and his doctor. Abruptly turning around, she runs straight into Chris. He's amused by their head-on collision, but she's in no mood to be detained. Karen informs Kevin that the new vial of the drug is even more potent than the last one. It seems to be getting stronger and more refined, which is how Joshua kept him hooked. Kevin decides to put all his trust in Karen. Caleb is exasperated with himself for letting Rafe get away. As for Olivia's bragging about his imminent return to power, he points out that he will still be in danger until regaining possession of the ring. After eliciting a solemn vow of secrecy from Olivia, Caleb informs her that the ring has the power to grant its wearer's every wish. Caleb warns that the ring is very dangerous unless used very wisely. Olivia promises to do whatever it takes to get it back. She can't stop thinking about what it will be like to have that kind of power. As Alison gives Joshua the cold shoulder, he strokes his own ego by talking about how good he's been to her. When she tries to get past him, he grabs her arm and injects her with the same drug he used on Kevin. Alison immediately realizes what happened. She proves to be very resistant to the drug, fighting its effects with all her willpower. She eventually begins to show signs of succumbing. Realizing that she's finally ready, he orders her to pour him some tea, and she obeys."

        "livvie: Yeah, but it was kind of all my fault. if I hadn't gone into the elixir like that and bragged to frank like some stupid jerk that you had your powers back --",

        "caleb: It's nice that you're proud, but --",
        "livvie: But what?",
        "caleb: Until I get that ring back, I'll always be looking over my shoulder. I've just been lucky so far.",
        "livvie: I don't understand.",
        "Caleb: Luck. lucky that joshua hasn't learned just how powerful the ring is or what it can really do.",
        "alison: Rafe, where are you? Why aren't you here yet?",
        "joshua: Alison. alison? hello? well, aren't you the brave girl, giving me the cold shoulder when I should be angry with you for trying to stl my ring. but since I'm a patient man and forgiving, I've given it some thought. and I'm willing to forgive you for all of your faults. so I've arranged for us to have tea together, so come, sit down and join me, and we'll have tea.",

        "joshua: You're not going anywhere tonight, my dear.",
        "alison: What was that in your hand? Was that a needle?",
        "Joshua: You're going to be ok. Just another couple of moments, you'll be fine.",
        "alison: What did you just do to me?",
        "Joshua: Just a little insurance. Just for me. just to make you a little more accommodating.",
        "alison: You wish.",
        "joshua: And to make sure you won't go back to your slayer boyfriend.",
        "alison: I don't think so, joshua. you can't keep me away from rafe. not ever.",

        "Ian: Lucy needs you.",
        "Rafe: I told you I'll meet you.",
        "Ian: I know what you told me. We're running out of time. She needs your blood. We tried everything else.",
        "rafe: Ok, so you think slayer blood's the answer?",
        "Ian: I don't know! But it makes sense. She fell in that pool of water, and she lost her slayer powers. If we can get them back somehow --",
        "rafe: We can save her life.",
        "Ian: Yeah. so, let's go.",

        "alison: You just -- you just gave me something, didn't you? You just gave me some sort of a drug.",
        "Joshua: Calm down. I'm just making sure that we live the life that I dreamed of.",
        "Alison: Yes, that's right -- what you've dreamt. What about what I want?",
        "Joshua: Forget about your dreams. We're going to do things my way. I told you that. You just have to accept it.",
        "Alison: Accept it? what, you and your vampire family? Never.",
        "joshua: Can't we talk about something a little more pleasant, alison?",
        "Alison: No. and even if I had all of the time in the world, I wouldn't have time for this.",
        "Joshua: Speaking of time, what time is it, alison?",
        "alison: I don't know.",
        "Joshua: What time is it?",
        "Alison: Why are you asking me that? Check your own watch.",
        "Joshua: I just wondered. I thought, perhaps, it was time to take a little tea.",
        "alison: I don't want any tea. I wouldn't do anything with you or for you. I wouldn't even give you the time of day.",
        "joshua: You're not quite ready yet. soon, you will be.",

        "alison: No, I don't want this. I just want to go.",
        "Joshua: You want to go where? Where do you want to go? You want to go home? you want to go home, alison? this is your home. this is your new home. this is our home. let's try that one more time, shall we? what time is it, alison?",
        "livvie: So, you're the only one who knows how powerful the ring really is?",
        "caleb: Its powers have grown over the years through each generation of my family.",
        "livvie: And you're saying that whoever wears it is safe from more than just vampires. well, how much more?",
        "caleb: Let's just say it's beyond your wildest dreams and then leave it at that.",
        "livvie: You don't trust me.",
        "caleb: Of course I do.",
        "livvie: No, you -- you know what? I don't blame you. you gave me that ring to protect me, and I was supposed to keep it safe, and I didn'T. and now joshua has --",
        "caleb: Stop. just stop. I gave you the ring to save your life. it was worth it.",
        "livvie: Yeah, but if it wasn't fore e --",
        "caleb: It's not about blame. it's about knowledge. if I tell you, you swear on your life you'll never tell anyone else about the ring's secrets?",
        "livvie: Never, I swear.",
        "caleb: It's part of my heritage, part of my destiny. but if joshua ever learns what power he holds when he wears the ring, I could never overpower him.",
        "livvie: Why? What? what does the ring do?",
        "caleb: If you know the way, it can grant the wishes of whoever wears it, making all of your dreams come true.",
        "elizabeth: You want kevin.",
        "Karen: I'm his doctor, elizabeth, that's all, and an old friend. I am not interested.",
        "Elizabeth: Oh, please. I've seen --",
        "karen: Listen to me. All I am trying to do is give kevin the help he needs. And you suggesting that I don't know how to treat his condition is not helping. it's plain, petty jealousy, and you've got to leave now.",
        "elizabeth: No, you have no rig --",
        "karen: Wrong. he's my patient, and you're not next of kin. I can have you thrown out.",
        "elizabeth: You wouldn't dare.",
        "karen: Want to try me?",
        "karen: Sorry about that -- hey! Hey!",
        "kevin: Just stay away, kan.N.",
        "Karen: Ok, calm down!",
        "Kevin: Look, I'll do better tomorrow, but for today I need this.",
        "Karen: I'm sorry. I can't let you have --",
        "kevin: No! I can't live like this.",
        "Karen: Ok, fine.",
        "Kevin: I can't take it.",
        "Karen: Fine. You want more? Go ahead. Do it. Do it all. Ok. you want to end your life, just do it, kevin. isn't that what joshua wanted when he first started you on this drug?",
        "kevin: I just need a little more.",
        "Karen: Fine. What are you waiting for? You've already thrown your life away. Why don't you just go ahead and finish it?",
        "kevin: Fine.",
        "karen: Ok, but one thing you need to know. if you crash and burn this time, I won't be there to help you.",
        "kevin: I won't need you, either.",
        "karen: You'll be alone and afraid and your head spinning. You'll be calling out for somebody, anybody, but you know what? The people you loved won't be there for you. they'll have forgotten you, kevin, shut you out.",
        "kevin: Ah, god! oh, god, what have I done? who the hell have I become?",
        "ian: Ramsey, I need your help.",
        "Chris: Just give me a second.",

        "Chris: Ok, what is that?",
        "Ian: Transfusion.",
        "chris: No.",
        "Ian: Slayer -- slayer blood this time.",
        "chris: She's not responding to transfusions. What are the odds another one is going to make a difference?",
        "Ian: Slayer blood is different, I hope.",
        "chris: Yeah, that's great. Well, look, the only other slayer in town is rafe. We don't even know where he is, so --",
        "ian: He's right there.",
        "chris: No.",
        "Ian: Don't ask.",
        "chris: He's not just resting, is he?",
        "Iaian: I gave him a little something.",
        "Chris: A little something? A little something on the top of the head it looks like. all right, so what's your idea?",
        "ian: Don't have time to explain right now. We can help lucy. Let's go.",
        "alison: The time?",
        "joshua: Go on.",
        "Alison: It's -- it's time for you to realize what a pathetic excuse of a man you are. joshua, you're a lousy vampire.",
        "Joshua: Careful.",
        "alison: Careful, why? You afraid -- you might actulyly drug me again?",
        "joshua: Your will is strong. So is your passion. But pretty soon, you will be mine.",
        "Alison: No, never. Never, ever. my heart belongs with rafe, and it always will.",
        "joshua: No, you're wrong about that.",
        "Alison: Why? do you have some master plan for me? because I know you would've already turned me by now.",
        "Joshua: No, there are other ways, alison.",
        "alison: You going to torture me for the rest of my life?",
        "Joshua: No. I'd just like to get on with my life. I'd like to get on with our lives, our mutual lives.",
        "Alison: Right.",
        "joshua: Try to be civil. I've been a gentleman. I haven't tried to turn you. I haven't forced you to sleep with me, have I? you have to say something about that, now. now, why don't you come and sit down and join me politely for some tea. you didn't answer my question, alison. What time is it? go on. You're almost there. What time is it, alison?",
        "alison: Never. never. no, never. I'm not doing this. Look, if you want the time, then why don't you check it yourself?",
        "joshua: Oh, look. I think you dropped this. yes, you did. you dropped this just as you were about to tell me thtitime. dear alison, what time is it?",
        "Alison: It's -- it's time for --",
        "joshua: Look again. look again. You're aost ready.",
        "livvie: Why, if you've had the ring all this time and it's held all this power and you can grant any wishes, did all those awful things happen to you? To me? why couldn't we be together?",
        "caleb: I used the ring's power unwisely.",
        "Livvie: How?",
        "caleb: You know the old saying \"be careful what you wish for\"? I wanted you so badly that I took all your goodness away.",
        "livvie: Guess you got yourisish.",
        "caleb: But I didn't consider the consequences.",
        "livvie: The ring had ruined you and destroyed the both of us.",
        "caleb: I told you it could be a dangerous thing. you have to know precisely how to use it.",
        "livvie: And when and where and why.",
        "caleb: If you lose sight of what you want or you ignore the consueuences, that ring ring can mean more harm than good. For the first time in my life, I know exactly what I want.",
        "Livvie: With all the power the ring held, you still gave it away. You gave it to me when I was in danger.",
        "caleb: I had to protect you.",
        "livvie: You trusted me with your legacy. you gave up all of your powers to keep me safe, and it worked, because I would be dead right now.",

        "livvie: I had no idea the sacrifice you had made for me.",
        "Caleb: Shh. for us, olivia. for us.",

        "chris: What? what was that? a head case. great legs, though.",
        "kevin: I don't get it, karen. I should have known better.",
        "Karen: Hey, don't be so hard on yourself. Your mind isn't your own right now.",
        "kevin: I know how detox works. I should have the willpower. all I know is that I want more and more and more. why can't I just stop?",
        "karen: It's the drug, kevin. joshua knows exactly what he's doing. he's made it so strong, it's robbed you of your own free will.",
        "kevin: I should know how to deal with i",
        "karen: But you can'T. there's a good reason why.",
        "kevin: What do you mean?",
        "karen: I've analyzed it -- the last vial that frank gave me -- and it's more potent than the one before and the one before that. It seems to be getting stronger, more refined.",
