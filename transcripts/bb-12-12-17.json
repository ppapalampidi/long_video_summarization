        "Thorne tells Brooke that he has wanted to kiss her for a long time but this was not planned. She says he has everything a woman would want and she's had good times with him, now and then. He says if she feels like that maybe they should give it another shot. Ridge confides in RJ that he has a surprise for his mom and he thinks she will love it. Nicole oversees Thorne and Brooke huddling together and goes back to tell Maya that they looked intimate close. Maya finds that hard to believe as everyone assumes it will be Brooke and Ridge again. Quinn and Ivy finish up her design for a gorgeous engagement ring to show Ridge. Thorne tells Brooke it is time to stop this little brother crap. He says she could have a much better future. Letting her go and not fighting for her was one of his biggest mistakes. But as long as she was happy and Ridge was treating her right, he could be okay with that. But now he finds Ridge has not been good for her, so she needs to consider her options and not be so quick to say yes again to him. She explains what she saw between Quinn and Ridge and the kiss in Australia. Later they said it was a goodbye kiss. Thorne says he hates saying this but she deserves so much more than his brother and not to believe all his denials and explanations.",
        "Ridge tells Quinn they have come a long way now, full circle. She says there is nothing between them any more but she knows what she did was hurtful. Ridge reminds her that now that Thorne is back he may bring it to the surface again and both of their futures will be at stake. Brooke is the only woman for him. Thorne tells Brooke to think about it because she knows what is in store for her with Ridge if she says yes. There will always be another affair for Ridge so do not accept that. Thorne says he will treat Brooke the way she should be. She's an incredible woman and now he comes home to this and she simply cannot marry his brother. He wants her to marry him instead."

        "Brooke: Uh, wow. [ Laughs ] You are full of surprises.",
        "Thorne: Wasn't planned. Although, I'm not gonna deny it. I've been wanting to kiss you for a long time. I hope I didn't completely surprise you.",
        "Brooke: Uh, no, I mean, i wasn't offended or anything.",
        "Thorne: Encouragement.",

        "Brooke: I've loved our time together.",
        "Thorne: Past or present?",
        "Brooke: Both. You have everything that a woman would want in a partner. You're charming and you're sweet and you're gorgeous and you're wise. You're a good guy.",
        "Thorne: You make me sound like a catch.",
        "Brooke: You are.",
        "Thorne: Well, if you feel that way, maybe we should give it another try.",
        "R.J.: What do you think?",
        "Ridge: What do I think? I think you have talent. It's raw, but you have potential.",
        "R.J.: Really? Thank you so much. I mean, your opinion means, like, everything, so...",
        "Ridge: Hey, let me -- let me ask you something. How -- how would you feel about me guiding you? It's gonna take some time...",
        "R.J.: No, no, that would -- that would be awesome. Really.",
        "Ridge: It'd be for me, not for you. The idea of recreating what i had with my dad with my son... it'd make me very happy.",
        "R.J.: Ah, well, you know, i heard uncle thorne, he put his pen in the ring.",
        "Ridge: Yeah. Uncle thorne is insinuating himself all over the place, wanted or not, talented or not.",
        "R.J.: I take it you're not impressed by his work.",
        "Ridge: Not as impressed as he is. I think he should keep his day job in paris.",
        "R.J.: Okay, so you're not happy he's back.",
        "Ridge: Nah. He's trying to start trouble between your mom and me. But don't worry, I'm not gonna let that happen.",

        "Nicole: Wow. South africa. That must have been an incredible experience.",
        "Maya: It was amazing. It's hard to describe. I mean, the whole thing was so \"go, go, go,\" but it barely felt like work. And everyone was so welcoming and embracing. It was life-changing.",
        "Nicole: That's great, maya.",
        "Maya: Yeah.",
        "Nicole: Can you even believe our lives right now?",

        "Maya: Okay! [ Laughs ]",
        "Nicole: So awesome.",
        "Maya: Yeah. I can't wait to go back. Spend some time exploring another culture...",
        "Nicole: I get it. Since zende and I moved to paris, it's like my eyes have been opened. I have a broader sense of the world.",
        "Maya: Yeah, it shows. You're more...sophisticated.",
        "Nicole: Oh, stop it.",
        "Maya: No, you are! You're more mature. Enlightened. Something... it looks good on you.",
        "Nicole: I'm just at a really good place in my life. And zende is, too. I mean, his designs keep getting better and better. But it is nice to come back and see you and rick and lizzy. Mom and dad, too. But you know, I didn't know thorne was coming back. If I had known, we could have just flown together. Have you seen him?",
        "Maya: Oh! Oh, yeah. He's, uh... he's staying here.",
        "Nicole: Here, here? In brooke's house?",
        "Maya: She insisted.",

        "Quinn: And you've been around, exposed to the finer things in life?",
        "Simon: I suppose, yes.",
        "Quinn: So, we would like your humble opinion. Which of these engagement rings do you prefer?",
        "Simon: Let me see. Emerald cut and brilliant cut, correct?",
        "Ivy: Yeah!",
        "Quinn: Very good.",

        "R.J.: How could uncle thorne possibly get between you and mom?",
        "Ridge: He can'T. Nothing's gonna come between us.",
        "R.J.: Oh, seems like you got a plan.",
        "Ridge: I have a surprise, and I think your mom's gonna love it.",

        "Thorne: Yes, I did.",
        "Brooke: And I'm very flattered, of course.",
        "Thorne: Well, that's a start. Where do we go from there?",
        "Brooke: [ Sighs ] You know I have a son with ridge.",
        "Thorne: Yeah. R.J. I mean, he's practically grown. He'll be out on his own in a few years, living his own life.",
        "Brooke: It's not that simple.",
        "Thorne: Sure it is. Plus, ridge hurts you. I'm sure R.J. Doesn't want to see that. Don't get his hopes up only to have them come crashing down when ridge cheats on you again.",
        "Brooke: You don't know that will happen.",
        "Thorne: Yes, I do. And so do you. That's just what my brother does. You and I, on the other hand, had a wonderful marriage. Great life together. There's no reason why we can't have that again.",
        "Ivy: So, you really think brooke will just accept everything and remarry ridge?",
        "Quinn: That's the plan.",
        "Ivy: Well, what if their luck has just run out?",
        "Quinn: Ivy, have you ever seen the way brooke looks at ridge, even when she's not fully onboard? This isn't about luck. It's about a connection that can't be broken.",
        "Ivy: Yeah, but connections change.",
        "Quinn: You think brooke and ridge aren't gonna get back together?",
        "Ivy: I'm just saying nothing's a given until it happens.",
        "[ Door opens ]",
        "Maya: I thought you were getting something to drink.",
        "Nicole: I was. I, um...",
        "Maya: What?",
        "Nicole: Nothing. Not exactly.",
        "Maya: All right, are you gonna make me guess?",
        "Nicole: I just saw brooke and thorne. But they looked....close, like, intimate close.",
        "Maya: What were they doing?",
        "Nicole: Just talking. Looking deeply into each other's eyes. Like they were in their own world. Which is why I came back 'cause it didn't seem like a good time to interrupt.",
        "Maya: Do you think something's going on between brooke and thorne?",
        "Quinn: Ha!",
        "Ridge: Did you finish it?",
        "Quinn: I brought you options.",
        "Ridge: And I appreciate the offer, but I'm gonna go with logan, I made up my mind.",
        "Quinn: Oh, wait, hold on. Let me just see if I have a laugh in there... no. No, I don'T.",
        "Ridge: Nothing?",
        "Quinn: Anyway, so I followed your specifications for the stones. Flawless, finest quality, both 8 carats, and I decided to do one as a round brilliant cut, and then of course I have the emerald cut, which I have to say, I'm a little partial to the emerald.",
        "Ridge: And I'll have to go with the talented quinn forrester. That setting's brilliant, it's very classy.",
        "Quinn: Yes. Class personified, if I do say so myself.",
        "Brooke: I have to say, I am so touched by you and what you said. But right now, I am more focused on your relationship with ridge. You'll have to find a way to get along with him.",
        "Thorne: Well, I'm not the one being dismissive. I mean, I came home with the best intentions towards my brother. I wanted to work with him, i wanted him to accept me as a designer. I realize I don't have the same experience, but I am good.",
        "Brooke: Nobody's saying you aren'T.",
        "Thorne: Yeah, but right away, he had to start at me, keeping me in my place, reminding that he's always been better than me. I mean, all that little brother crap, it's kind of immature.",
        "Brooke: Yeah, ridge is difficult that way. I know. But you can't keep fighting like this.",
        "Thorne: It's not how I want it, it's how ridge wants it. Whatever, it's fine with me.",
        "Brooke: What can I do, thorne? I mean, there's got to be something.",
        "Thorne: Yeah, you can stop caring for him so much and see a better future. You know, I've been thinking about my life, analyzing where i went wrong, what I did right. Letting you go, not fighting for you was one of the biggest mistakes I ever made.",
        "Brooke: We were good together.",
        "Thorne: Yeah, we were. And coming home, I wanted to respect you and ridge. I wasn't gonna bring up my feelings for you. I could have lived my life without you in it, the way i wanted you. As long as you were happy and ridge was treating you right. And then I find out what he did with quinn, how he hurt you yet again. Not to mention dad. My brother's incapable of commitment.",
        "Brooke: People change.",
        "Thorne: Not ridge. You know, I've really loved spending this time with you. It feels good. And if I can save you from another go-around with my brother that will only end in heartache, I want to do that. Just don't be so quick to commit to a future with my brother. Consider your options.",
        "Maya: I know they were married for a while.",
        "Nicole: There's still a connection. That's obvious.",
        "Maya: But everyone assumes that brooke and ridge are gonna get back together.",
        "Nicole: Mm, I don't know if that's necessarily a sure thing though, not after what I just saw. And brooke's divorce from bill is still processing, so thorne has plenty of time to press his case, and he's living right here.",
        "Maya: Wow. I wonder if ridge has any idea that his brother may still have feelings for brooke.",
        "Ridge: Can you do me a favor? Can we keep this ring business between us? Brooke doesn't need to know that you...",
        "Quinn: I -- I get it, I get it. The fewer reminders of our little dalliance, the better. You really need to stop thinking about it, though.",
        "Ridge: Thinking about what?",
        "Quinn: The kisses that we shared.",
        "Ridge: I don't think about that.",
        "Quinn: [ Laughs ] Liar.",
        "Ridge: It may have crossed my mind in the past, but now you got to let this go, really.",
        "Quinn: Oh, yeah, I guess i do. I do.",
        "Ridge: We've come a long way, haven't we?",
        "Quinn: Yeah. Yeah. From enemies to...whatever we were in the middle...to now friends.",
        "Ridge: Yeah. Minimal damage. You and dad are okay, and i think brooke and I, we're -- we're gonna figure it out.",
        "Quinn: You will, ridge. I have no doubt.",
        "Thorne: What could have possibly been going through ridge's mind when he chose to kiss our father's wife the day before he was supposed to marry you? I mean, how can you even consider spending your life with a man who thinks so little of you?",
        "Brooke: Fair question.",
        "Thorne: You want to tell me what happened that day?",
        "Brooke: Between ridge and quinn? No, I don't like talking about that.",
        "Thorne: [ Sighs ] You know, keeping it in only gives it power. If you let it out, then maybe you can let it go.",
        "Brooke: Okay... well, as you know, we were in sydney, australia, for liam and steffy's wedding. I was feeling great, you know? I was really excited that I was gonna marry ridge the next day. And d I lost him somewhere on the beach, and eric said that he went for a walk, so I ran down the beach to catch up with him, and I went around the bluff, and there he was, with quinn. They were standing so close, it was like they had some kind of secret. She just reached out and... gently touch his arm. He look at her, and I knew -- I knew what was gonna happen. That's when they kissed. I was -- I was shocked. Really, I was shocked and devastated for eric and for me.",
        "Thorne: What kind of kiss?",
        "Brooke: [ Scoffs ] I don't know.",
        "Thorne: Yes, you do. You saw it.",
        "Brooke: They said it was a goodbye kiss.",
        "Thorne: And you choose to believe that? You realize you're making excuses for a man who is supposed to be 100% committed to you. I hate saying this, but you deserve so much better than my brother. Give yourself a chance at true happiness.",
        "Maya: Okay, if it's true that thorne is making a play for brooke, you know how competitive ridge is with his brothers, and thorne even more than rick. If they go head to head over brooke...",
        "Nicole: I know. I hate to think what it could do to the family.",
        "Ridge: I like your confidence in the future.",
        "Quinn: Well, these things take time, you know? What we did to brooke was... it was hurtful. She needed time to process, get to a place of forgiveness. Like eric did. I mean, it's not even a thing between us anymore.",
        "Ridge: And brooke was almost there, and then thorne comes back and he had to stir everything up.",
        "Quinn: What -- what does thorne have to do with anything?",
        "Ridge: He knows.",
        "Quinn: About us?",
        "Ridge: Yeah, about us. I don't know how, but he does, and he -- he came over to brooke's house and told her how horrible I am, and you should have seen her face, just reliving everything.",
        "Quinn: That's not okay.",
        "Ridge: No, it's not okay. I just want to get past this, look to our future, you know? And I thought maybe... maybe this would help show her that she's the only woman for me.",
        "Thorne: You're upset.",
        "Brooke: Uh, no. No. But I told you, I don't like thinking about ridge and quinn.",
        "Thorne: Easier just to forget what you saw?",
        "Brooke: Yes.",
        "Thorne: Put it out of your mind? Pretend it never happened?",
        "Brooke: Yes.",
        "Thorne: But it did happen, brooke, and there's nothing you can do to change that. You can't go rushing into a marriage that you know is going to end in heartache down the road. Because that's what my brother has in store for you.",
        "[ Cellphone rings ]",
        "Brooke: Hey. The nerve of you!",
        "Thorne: You can yell at me later. I need your attention.",
        "Brooke: [ Scoffs ] Okay. You got it.",
        "Thorne: It's time to say no. It's time to say no. You will not allow ridge to break your heart ever again. You will not stand for one more betrayal and one more affair because you know they're coming. They always do. Is that what you want? Or do you want the man who's truly there for you? Truly adores you. Don't marry a man who can betray you and his own father the way he did. I couldn't even conceive doing something like that.",
        "Brooke: I know you couldn'T.",
        "Thorne: I would treat you the way you deserve to be treated. And I'd be grateful to have you in my life.",
        "Brooke: Thorne...",
        "Thorne: I've been thinking a lot about my life and all the people I've lost. People I trusted. People I love. No one more than you. You're an incredible woman. I was devastated when we broke up, but I accepted it, and then... I come home to this. You cannot marry my brother. If you're gonna marry anyone, you marry me, brooke. You marry me."
