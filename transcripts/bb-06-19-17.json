    "Recap": [
        "Ridge tells Quinn that Deacon is in jail so she is safe now. She says yes thanks to him. And she meant it when she said she loves him. He says she is safe so that is all that matters. Nicole remembers back when little Lizzy was born and put in her arms. Zende walks in and asks if she is okay. She replies yes she is just fine. He senses she is still down and says they have only been trying a few months but it is going to happen. The doctors did not say it was impossible. He assures her everything will turn out, he promises. Rick informs Maya that it is no big deal but there is some clerical error and they need to sign more adoption papers for Lizzy. Maya says it is a sensitive time now for Nicole so she will take the papers in to her privately. Nicole conveys to Coco that she is afraid \u0096 she might not be able to have more children. She says she could not stand it when Maya and Rick took off to Paris and left Lizzy. She would never do that. Maybe she made a mistake giving the child to them.",
        "Eric comes in and is glad both Ridge and Quinn are there. He tells them they have a visitor and invites Sheila in. Sheila says hello to Ridge and says he looks different. He asks his dad why this woman is here after all she has done to this family. Eric says they were all judging Sheila by her past and she had nothing to do with what Deacon did. She says she regrets all of it and she is deeply sorry. Ridge says okay she said her peace and now she can get out. Sheila starts to leave and laments that she does not want to be a distraction. Eric says she is being treated unfairly and it is them that should be apologizing to her. He offers her a glass of tea and goes to get it. She looks at the Quinn portrait over the mantel and says how charming \u0096 the matriarch of the family now. She tells Quinn she heard of what happened with Deacon and she is lucky to have someone so devoted as Eric. She says she is not mad that they put her in jail, all is well that ends well. She just wanted to come by and make amends. When she leaves the room Ridge says now she can leave. Eric says no, he wants to keep an eye on her and keep her close. Ridge says this is wrong as Sheila manipulates people. Eric reminds him that they put Sheila in jail and that was wrong. Ridge tells Quinn that he does not want Sheila here; Eric is playing with fire. Sheila thanks Eric and says his words mean a lot. He says anyone can change if they want to and he believes she has. They say goodbye outside and he tells her to take care of herself. She gives a backward sly look. When the papers are presented to Nicole she tells Maya that she thought that was finalized a long time ago. She wants Maya to explain \u0096 Lizzy is not really hers yet. Maya says she will be as soon as Nicole re-signs these papers. She is not Lizzy's mother; Maya is so please sign the papers. Nicole hears Lizzy cry and suddenly says she can't .she cannot sign the papers. Maya gets agitated and clenches her jaw and says she is the mother and Rick the father so Nicole must sign those papers right now!"

        "Ridge: You know, it's safe to go out there.",
        "Quinn: It's gonna take awhile.",
        "Ridge: Deacon's in jail. He admitted he tried to shoot you.",
        "Quinn: And he would have shot me if it hadn't been for you. Sorry. What I said after everything... but I do. I-I do love you, ridge.",
        "Ridge: That's enough.",
        "Quinn: Seeing Brooke and bill together, everything you've lost because of me --",
        "Ridge: I'm to blame for that, too. But you're safe. And that's all that matters.",
        "Quinn: Because of you.",
        "Zende: Hey, baby.",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Zende: You all right?",
        "Nicole: I'm fine.",
        "Maya: Or Maya or --",
        "Rick: You got to love that guy's attitude. He's not giving up on his wife.",
        "Maya: Uh-huh.",
        "Rick: [Chuckles] Is mommy even listening to me? Of course not. How can she with you in her arms?",
        "Maya: [Laughs]",
        "Rick: Come here.",
        "Maya: Aww! I heard every word you said. You were talking about Zende and Nicole. So, how did the conversation end?",
        "Rick: I was interrupted by carter. He needed to see me.",
        "Maya: About?",
        "Rick: About this one. Apparently we have an issue with our adoption papers.",
        "Maya: What kind of issue?",
        "Rick: Some clerical errors with the adoption papers. It's no biggie.",
        "Maya: Okay, so what do we have to do?",
        "Rick: We have to sign the papers. The corrections have been made.",
        "Maya: All right. Well, you're here, I'm here. Let's do it.",
        "Rick: We need Nicole's signature, too.",
        "Zende: Okay. All right. I see what's going on here. You're worried about maybe not being able to have a family with me. It's gonna happen. We're not giving up on that. Remember. I know you're battling with this idea that you may not have children again, but the doctors weren't definite. We're young, and, you know, we've only been trying for a few months. Yes, it happened fairly quickly with Lizzy, but it's gonna happen for us, too, okay? It's gonna happen.",
        "Nicole: Lizzy's so beautiful. I don't know how they could leave for Paris like that. I couldn't do it.",
        "Coco: Oh, hey. Uh, sorry.",
        "Zende: It's all right. I forgive you.",
        "Nicole: You have a minute?",
        "Coco: Yeah.",
        "Nicole: You mind if coco and I catch up?",
        "Zende: Yeah. Yeah, go right ahead. Um, I should get back to my designs. They won't draw themselves, so... everything is gonna work out. I promise. Okay?",
        "Coco: Bye.",
        "Zende: Bye.",
        "Coco: Is everything okay? Nicole, what's wrong?",
        "Nicole: I may not be able to have any more children.",
        "Ridge: You're safe, and you're alive. You're strong. You're gonna move past deacon and everything else.",
        "Quinn: \"Everything\" meaning this?",
        "Ridge: Especially this.",
        "Eric: Good. You're both here.",
        "Quinn: Eric, where did you go?",
        "Eric: I had something I had to handle. We have a visitor.",
        "Quinn: We do?",
        "Eric: Sheila?",
        "Maya: Rick, after what Nicole gave us, she has to be able to have another child. This was her first, but it can't be her last.",
        "Rick: She still needs to sign the adoption papers.",
        "Maya: Right. I'll take them to her.",
        "Rick: Do you want some help with that?",
        "Maya: No, I think I need a private moment with my sister.",
        "Coco: Secondary infertility?",
        "Nicole: Could be a result of Lizzy's birth.",
        "Coco: But they said \"may be.\"",
        "Nicole: Yeah. They said a lot of things.",
        "Coco: Nicole.",
        "Nicole: I'm scared.",
        "Coco: I know. I know. But nothing's definite, okay? And you have so much time, and you have so many people that love and support you. And I'm one of them.",
        "Nicole: I can feel myself changing, becoming judgmental.",
        "Coco: Of who?",
        "Nicole: Myself. And pretty much everyone else. Rick and Maya.",
        "Coco: Okay. Why? Why? What about them?",
        "Nicole: The way they took off for Paris and left Lizzy. They even wanted a nanny. I was not gonna let a stranger watch her.",
        "Coco: Okay, yeah, you did -- you did spend a lot of time with her.",
        "Nicole: Maybe too much time.",
        "Coco: What makes you say that?",
        "Nicole: Something happened, coco. While I was watching Lizzy. I started seeing things differently. How could Maya leave for Paris like that? I mean, I gave them that baby. And how could she just --",
        "Coco: Okay, okay, no, no, calm down, calm down.",
        "Nicole: And all of these feelings, I can't stop them, and I can't help but feel that I have made a very big mistake.",
        "Coco: A mistake? I don't --",
        "Nicole: No. No, no. Maya and rick are good parents. Maya and rick are good parents. But I love Lizzy, too.",
        "Coco: Of course you do.",
        "Nicole: No. You don't get it.",
        "Sheila: It's good to see you again, ridge. You look different. And, Quinn, nice to -- to properly meet you.",
        "Ridge: Hey, dad. What are you doing? Why is she here?",
        "Eric: Sheila's had a very trying time of this, too.",
        "Ridge: Why is she here in our home after everything that happened?",
        "Eric: She had nothing to do with all this deacon insanity. She was a victim of it all just as much as my wife was. How are you? You okay?",
        "Quinn: I-I'm feeling a little bit better.",
        "Eric: Yeah? Good. That's all thanks to him.",
        "Ridge: Let's stay on point. Why is this woman here after everything she has done to our family?",
        "Eric: Well, that's exactly why we were all so quick to rush to judgment. I was, too. I'm well aware of the horrible things that Sheila's done to our family. My eyes are wide open. But for her to be falsely accused and to spend a day in jail for it?",
        "Sheila: You were judging me for the person that I was in the past, all of you, and I don't blame you for any of that. And I don't expect you to believe me when I say that I've changed, but I have. I regret it, all of it, especially what I did to your family. For what it's worth, it's not much -- I'm deeply, sincerely sorry.",
        "Ridge: That's sweet. You apologized. Now get out.",
        "Eric: I don't think it's too much to ask for us to at least listen.",
        "Ridge: I just did listen.",
        "Sheila: Eric, you know what? Thank you. Thank you for bringing me into your home. But I do understand ridge's concerns, and I'm a distraction I don't want to be.",
        "Eric: Sheila, I know this has been difficult for you, for you to have to spend a day in jail. I think maybe we owe you an apology.",
        "Ridge: What?",
        "Eric: Look, I'm just trying to be decent here, ridge. Would you like a glass of ice tea?",
        "Sheila: That'd be lovely.",
        "Eric: Good. Please. Go on in. I'll get it for you.",
        "Sheila: A stunning portrait. The new Forrester matriarch.",
        "Eric: Here you are, Sheila.",
        "Sheila: Thank you.",
        "Eric: Yeah.",
        "Sheila: Such a beautiful home. I remember it well.",
        "Ridge: I'm sure you do.",
        "Sheila: Quinn, you must have been horrified. Eric told me about what happened.",
        "Eric: Thank god ridge was there to save her. I don't know what I would have done if anything had happened to you.",
        "Sheila: You're a very lucky woman, you know, to have so much goodness in your life. The woman that I'm becoming right now is largely because of this man. Only I could have screwed that up. He's lucky to have someone so devoted and loyal.",
        "Quinn: Thank you, Sheila. That's very nice of you to say.",
        "Sheila: And, ridge... I heard that Brooke married bill Spencer. I thought for sure that you and Brooke would have ended up together.",
        "Ridge: Well, I'm fine. Don't worry about me.",
        "Sheila: I'm not worried about you. I know you can take care of yourself. Much like you took care of your father's wife. Thank you for the tea. Uh... as far as putting me in jail...",
        "Eric: Yeah, well, I'm sorry about that.",
        "Sheila: Oh, don't worry about it. All's well that ends well. I just wanted to come by and try to make amends for my past. I'm gonna be leaving town. If you feel the need to get in touch with me, my information's on the card.",
        "Ridge: You should keep it.",
        "Sheila: Do you mind if I freshen up before I leave?",
        "Eric: No, not at all. Uh, powder room's right through here.",
        "Sheila: I know where it's at.",
        "Ridge: What are you doing? Why is she here in our house?",
        "Eric: Do this with me.",
        "Ridge: Do what with you?",
        "Eric: This. This. I know what she's capable of. I want to keep her close.",
        "Zende: What do you think?",
        "Rick: Well, I'm no designer, but I see some real growth here.",
        "Zende: Yes. Progress.",
        "Rick: You know, you should leave these for Steffy and ridge to see.",
        "Zende: Okay. Is Maya in yet?",
        "Rick: Yeah, she's with your wife. Uh, we needed to get a couple signatures from Nicole.",
        "Zende: Signatures?",
        "Rick: The adoption papers need to be finalized.",
        "Zende: I thought that was done already when Lizzy was born.",
        "Rick: Yeah, so did I. But apparently there's some clerical errors. It's nothing major. Carter brought over the changes, and Maya's filling in Nicole. We're gonna get her to sign.",
        "Coco: You're right, Nicole. Rick and Maya are excellent parents. They raised Lizzy since birth. And -- and just because they took off for a business trip doesn't --",
        "Nicole: I know, I know. But I can't help it. All of these feelings are bouncing around inside of me. It's just like I can't control them. It's totally irrational. But I just can't stop all of the noise that is in my head, and I hear Lizzy calling me mama, and what that does, I can't begin to describe it. I sound crazy, don't I?",
        "Coco: No. No, you just -- you sound like someone who has a lot going on. Have you talked to Zende at all?",
        "Nicole: No.",
        "Coco: Okay.",
        "Nicole: I haven't talked to anybody but you, because you are my friend and I trust you.",
        "Coco: I'm really, really glad you do. And -- and nothing you say here is leaving this room.",
        "Nicole: I just wish there was some resolution to all of this. But if I can't have another child and Lizzy's my only shot at motherhood...",
        "[Knock on door, door opens]",
        "Maya: Hey, guys.",
        "Coco: Hey. Hey, welcome back.",
        "Maya: Oh, thank you. It is, uh, it's good to be home. Hey, coco, do you mind if I have a couple minutes with my sister?",
        "Coco: Um... we'll talk later. Sorry.",
        "Nicole: So what's going on?",
        "Maya: Oh, carter dropped off this paperwork to rick, and, uh, we have to do a few signatures.",
        "Nicole: What is it?",
        "Maya: The adoption papers.",
        "Nicole: I thought that was finalized a long time ago.",
        "Eric: I had her put in jail for a crime she did not commit.",
        "Ridge: That remains to be seen.",
        "Eric: She's trying to turn her life around.",
        "Ridge: No, what she's trying to do is get back with this family. She manipulates people.",
        "Eric: I know, ridge! I know.",
        "Sheila: I just wanted to say thank you again. You don't know how much this means to me, being in this house after all these years.",
        "Ridge: Well, you said what you had to say. And now it's time to go. Come on.",
        "Sheila: Can I just --",
        "Eric: Ridge, ridge, I'll show her out. Thank you.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Quinn: Was that really necessary?",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Ridge: Yes. I don't want her here. My dad is playing with fire.",
        "Eric: Sorry about that.",
        "Sheila: Oh, don't apologize for him. I really can't blame ridge. But thank you for sticking up for me.",
        "Eric: He doesn't believe you've changed.",
        "Sheila: But I have. You can see it, can't you, Eric?",
        "Eric: I want to believe that anybody can change if they really want to.",
        "Sheila: [Chuckles] That means a lot to me. Thank you. And I'm -- I'm really happy that you found someone like Quinn who treats you the way you deserve to be treated. But let me tell you what. If she doesn't, I just might bust her one.",
        "Eric: Well, don't worry. Quinn is just about the ideal wife. She's -- she's committed, she's dedicated.",
        "Sheila: Good. It's what you deserve -- the perfect wife. I can see myself to the car. But thank you, Eric, for everything.",
        "Eric: Okay. Take care of yourself, Sheila.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Zende: What kind of mistakes?",
        "Rick: Huh?",
        "Zende: On the original adoption papers. What kind of mistakes?",
        "Rick: Oh, it's just a few typos. You know, that sort of thing. Nothing relevant. No worries. We'll get Nicole to sign. We'll be done with it.",
        "Nicole: I don't get it. We signed these adoption papers ages ago.",
        "Maya: I know. Um, but there were some clerical issues, so carter just drew up a new set.",
        "Nicole: I thought it was finalized.",
        "Maya: We all did. And, I mean, between us it's final, so once you sign, it'll be legal.",
        "Nicole: So... Lizzy's not yours.",
        "Maya: No, of course she is. Maybe not legally. It's not a big deal. Same document with the corrections. And, um, the terms are all the same. So it's nothing to really be concerned about. Um, here's a pen. And -- and you just sign right by the yellow.",
        "Nicole: Oh, my god. You mean... you mean that I'm her mother?",
        "Maya: No, Nicole. I am Lizzy's mother. Just please. Please sign the papers.",
        "Lizzy: Ah! Mamama!",
        "Nicole: I can't. I can't do it. I can't sign the papers.",
        "Maya: What do you mean, you can't sign the papers?",
        "Nicole: Maybe this is a sign. Maybe this is happening for a reason.",
        "Maya: No! No, Nicole. Listen to me. I am Lizzy's mother. Rick is Lizzy's father. Just sign those papers. Sign those papers right now!"
