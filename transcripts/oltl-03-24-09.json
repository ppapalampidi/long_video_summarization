        "Todd goes to see if Viki can support him in his effort to clean up his act and get his kids back since nobody else can raise them at the present time. She tells her brother she'd like to help him but she finds it despicable that he wants to petition to take the kids away from Blair after what happened to her. Tea goes and informs Viki that she plans to represent Blair in the custody battle. And they both reflect how they both have a habit of having to \"rescue\" Todd. Blair awakens and asks John what happened. He informs her that she was stabbed. Natalie and Jared have gotten DNA proof that the baby known as Chloe is really Starr's. But they haven't a clue how they can tell Jessica. Jessica is getting closer to Brody. Stacy tells Gigi that if she wants to save Shane's life and have her sister donate the bone marrow, she has to give up Rex and \"give\" him to Stacy. Gigi tells her sister she is insane."

        "Todd: Viki. You said you ant to help me. Well, I need you right now. Lets go.",
        "Viki: For God's sakes, keep your voice down. Jesse's trying to put Chloe down for a nap.",
        "Todd: No, we need to go now. This is very important.",
        "Viki: Why? Who's after you now?",
        "Todd: No, I'm going after custody of my kids.",
        "Viki: While Blair's in a coma. That's disgusting, even for you.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Michael, she's awake?",
        "Michael: Yeah, she's a little groggy and disoriented, but --",
        "Starr: Can we go in and see her?",
        "Michael: Yeah, but keep it one at a time and kind of brief, all right? We don't want to overwhelm her.",
        "Starr: Okay.",
        "Addie: I think Starr should go first.",
        "Starr: Grandma, are you sure?",
        "Addie: Sweetheart, you're the one she woke up to see.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Kyle: Come in.",
        "Natalie: Hey, I'm sorry to bug you. I know we dropped off samples earlier.",
        "Kyle: Yeah, I put a rush on them.",
        "Natalie: You did?",
        "Kyle: Yeah, I mean after the David Vickers paternity test screw-up, it's the least I could do.",
        "Jared: We appreciate it.",
        "Kyle: No problem. I'll go and check the results for you.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, I was kind of hoping that he'd say the results would take, like, forever. Jared, are we just nuts for doing this?",
        "Jared: Sweetie, clean DNA samples for both Starr and her baby just sort of fell into our hands. It's like we're doing what we're supposed to be doing.",
        "Natalie: Right, right. So any minute we're going to find out beyond a shadow of a doubt whether or not Jessica is raising a baby that isn't hers.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: Hi, Brody.",
        "Brody: Hey.",
        "Jessica: Come in, come in.",
        "Brody: Thanks. You said you wanted to be friends. I sort of need a friend.",
        "Jessica: Did something happen?",
        "Brody: I got a call from the lab about the bone marrow thing. I'm not a match. I really wanted to do that for Shane.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: I can't imagine what you must be going through.",
        "Nora: I know I should be grateful that Matthew is alive. And I thank God for that every day. But I just can't help but to know how compromised his life is from now on.",
        "T\u00e9a: I know you. You'll tolerate your own pain and focus on helping your son adjust to this.",
        "Nora: All right, this isn't a sympathy call, so why are you here, T\u00e9a?",
        "T\u00e9a: Marty has asked me to represent Cole.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: It's because Blair's in a coma that my kids need me.",
        "Viki: Starr's 17, she's practically an adult. And I think Jack and Sam have had enough upheaval in their lives.",
        "Todd: So I should leave them with Dorian.",
        "Viki: I may be Dorian's severest critic, but she could not love those children more.",
        "Todd: More than me? God, I don't understand you. Weren't you there when Jack told me he wanted me to be his father again?",
        "Viki: Yeah, I was there. I heard what he said. But you're not doing this for your children. You're doing this to hurt Blair. Hasn't that poor woman been through enough?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: Mom?",
        "Blair: Hi.",
        "Starr: Mom, hi. I'm right here.",
        "Blair: Where am I?",
        "Starr: You're in the hospital.",
        "Blair: What happened?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Stacy: All you have to do is let Rex go, Gigi. Shane will be okay. So what's it going to be, sis?",
        "Rex: What's going on?",
        "Gigi: How's Shane?",
        "Rex: He fell asleep. But check it out -- \"Chemo Boy Versus the Evil Lou Kemia.\" Great, huh?",
        "Gigi: Yeah.",
        "Rex: I walked in on something between you two. What is it?",
        "Stacy: Why don't you tell him, Gigi?",
        "Rex: Is it Shane?",
        "Gigi: No, it's Stacy. She was trying to make a deal with me.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Starr: You fell and you hit your head.",
        "Blair: I don't remember.",
        "Starr: Yeah, it's okay. You've been asleep for a really long time. But you're awake now, and --",
        "Blair: The boys?",
        "Starr: The boys are just fine, but they really miss you.",
        "Blair: You tell them --",
        "Starr: That you love them and you miss them. I'll do that, okay?",
        "Blair: I love you, baby.",
        "Starr: I love you, too, Mom. I'm so glad that you're back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Addie: When do you think we should tell her?",
        "John: Tell her what happened to her?",
        "Addie: That Todd's trying to take her children.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Todd: Blair's in a coma, for God's sake. The kids are scared to death, Viki.",
        "Viki: Aren't the doctor's planning to bring her out of the coma soon?",
        "Todd: Oh well, then I guess the kids can just hang out with no parents until then.",
        "Viki: Todd, you have a restraining order against them. You're not even allowed to see them.",
        "Todd: Not any more.",
        "Viki: What does that mean?",
        "Todd: It expired. I can see them whenever I want.",
        "Viki: Well then, what are you doing here? Why aren't you with Sam and Jack?",
        "Todd: I was just with them. Dorian had me kicked out. And you know that the minute Blair's back on her feet she's going to have that restraining order reinstated.",
        "Viki: No, you don't know that.",
        "Todd: She uses those kids to get even with me.",
        "Viki: No, she's trying to protect her children because you have repeatedly endangered their lives.",
        "Todd: I, uh -- I've been seeing a shrink, and took an anger management course. Yeah, I know I'm trying to change. Do you remember what you told me after I tried to off myself and I was having trouble recovering from that? You told me to start with my kids. Well, that's what I'm doing. This is not a power play, I swear. My kids need me, and I need them. So are you going to help me or not?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: You know, kids his age are usually really afraid of illness. And most grown-ups treat cancer as if it's contagious. So, you know, who knows how many of his friends are showing up for him right now.",
        "Brody: I don't know what I'm going to do if he doesn't make it.",
        "Jessica: You can't think like that, Brody.",
        "Brody: No, I have to. I have to be prepared.",
        "Jessica: For what?",
        "Brody: What if I can't handle it?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Rex: A deal? What kind of deal?",
        "Gigi: Stacy wants us to bury the hatchet for Shane's sake.",
        "Stacy: His recovery is all that matters right now.",
        "Rex: So Gigi's supposed to be okay with you slipping me a mickey and then lying about it.",
        "Stacy: I would never do that to you, Rex. You have to believe me.",
        "Rex: You know what? You're right. We've got to squash all that and focus 100% on Shane.",
        "Stacy: I'm with you. That's why I told Gigi we really need to start acting as a family. We need to do everything in our power to save Shane.",
        "Rex: Starting with finding him a bone marrow donor. I'm going to check to see if there's been any matches.",
        "Gigi: I'll go with you.",
        "Stacy: Rex, do you mind if I just finish my conversation with Gigi? It will only take a minute.",
        "Rex: I thought everything was settled.",
        "Gigi: It is. Um, go ahead and I'll catch up with you.",
        "Stacy: There for a minute I thought you were going to rat me out.",
        "Gigi: I wanted to but I couldn't do it.",
        "Stacy: All you have to do is tell Rex the two of you are through, or Shane's going to die.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Antonio: Miss me?",
        "Talia: Oh! You weren't supposed to be back until tomorrow.",
        "Antonio: I did say that, didn't I?",
        "Talia: Well, you're stupid. I'm glad you're home. I'm never going to let you leave me again, do you understand me? What? What's wrong? Talk to me. Tell me.",
        "Antonio: I'm not staying.",
        "Talia: What do you mean, you're not staying?",
        "Antonio: This case I've been working on, honey. It's gotten bigger, much bigger. I've asked to be a part of it.",
        "Talia: So then you're just going back? You're leaving us?",
        "Antonio: You make it sound like I'm going to be gone forever.",
        "Talia: Why?",
        "Antonio: Because it's become personal for me.",
        "Talia: And you can't tell me anything about it because it's classified. Classified I get, but is there another reason? Do you not trust me? Am I the reason?",
        "Antonio: You're the reason, I'm the reason, Cristian, Jamie. It's all of us.",
        "Talia: How could a case that you're working on be dangerous for all of us? Oh, my God. It's my father, isn't it? You're trying to take down my father.",
        "Antonio: We can finally put Carlo away this time, forever.",
        "Talia: You cannot go back, okay? He'll kill you. Just walk away.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jessica: You can handle it. Whatever happens, you can handle it.",
        "Brody: You don't know that.",
        "Jessica: You know the truth about what happened to that little boy in Iraq. And you're not confusing him for Shane anymore.",
        "Brody: But if Shane dies too --",
        "Jessica: Listen. He's not going to die today. You know that, right? And that's all you can do. You've got to take it one day at a time.",
        "Brody: Is that what you do?",
        "Jessica: Well, I try. You know, I'm in control now but I might not always be that way if something horrible happens.",
        "Brody: Like when your husband --",
        "Jessica: Yes. Yes, I could lose control and -- I'm okay for today.",
        "Brody: How do you do it?",
        "Jessica: Well, I don't have a choice. I'm a mom, you know? Chloe and Bree depend on me and I depend on them. Do you want to hold her? Come on, the worst she'll do is suck on your arm or spit up on you or something.",
        "Brody: Okay.",
        "Jessica: There you go. You remember Brody, huh?",
        "Brody: Hey, little girl. Yeah.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Natalie: Bree and Chloe are Jessica's life, you know? And I think for Jessica, Chloe was the last beautiful thing she was able to make with Nash before he died. And now what if Chloe isn't hers? And what if her baby is really dead?",
        "Jared: We don't have proof yet, okay?",
        "Natalie: Come on. We both know that Bess switched those babies.",
        "Jared: Why don't we wait until we have confirmation? Sweetie, you were tossing and turning all night long.",
        "Natalie: Yeah, well, you know what? I just feel like I haven't slept in a million years, you know? I just keep thinking. I mean, maybe we should just put a stop to this and leave things as they are. I mean, Starr didn't even want to keep her baby.",
        "Jared: What about Michael and Marcie? And just because Starr didn't want to keep her baby doesn't mean she wanted her baby dead.",
        "Natalie: You know what, Jared? You were the one who wanted me to drop this in the first place.",
        "Jared: I know, but we can't play God here. We don't get to decide who knows what, okay? We tried that before. It blew up in our faces, remember?",
        "Natalie: All right, but what if this is different?",
        "Jared: We are in too deep, Natalie. We have -- look, I know this is weird coming from me -- a moral obligation.",
        "Natalie: To what? Break my sister's heart? Send her right back into St. Ann's?",
        "Kyle: You're in luck. The results just came back.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Nora: Cole despises you.",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah, he wasn't that into the idea at first.",
        "Nora: But you talked him into it, I bet.",
        "T\u00e9a: No, he hasn't officially agreed to let me represent him. Nora, the kid is extremely remorseful.",
        "Nora: He's not a kid. He's an 18-year-old man.",
        "T\u00e9a: And you want to prosecute him to the full extent of the law. Well, guess what? That's what he wants, too.",
        "Nora: Okay, you know what? Why don't we just save it for the courtroom, Counselor?",
        "T\u00e9a: I didn't come here to upset you.",
        "Nora: I know why you came here. You wanted to feel me out. A little ex parte communication with the victim's mother.",
        "T\u00e9a: I know you're suffering. It is not my intention --",
        "Nora: You're trying to manipulate me, and it is your intention.",
        "[Cell phone rings]",
        "T\u00e9a: Dorian again.",
        "Nora: Why don't you just take it because I think we're done here.",
        "T\u00e9a: Listen, I am trying to take cases for the right reasons.",
        "Nora: Well, that's a first.",
        "T\u00e9a: Cole made a life-altering mistake.",
        "Nora: No. He made a mistake that altered the life of my son.",
        "T\u00e9a: Cole is not a criminal, Nora. And you know that. Now, he could spend the rest of his life in prison, but who is that going to serve? He is in trouble, and he needs help. I know you're someone who cares about justice, so all I'm asking is that you think about what justice really is in this case. Honey, my prayers are -- with you and with your family, whether you believe it or not.",
        "T\u00e9a: Dorian, what do you want?",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Gigi: If Shane dies they're going to have to bury me right beside him. Do you get that? My son is everything to me.",
        "Stacy: And I'm offering you a chance to save him.",
        "Gigi: By trading your bone marrow for the love of my life?",
        "Stacy: I thought Shane was the love of your life. You know, you really are going to have to choose, Gigi. Who's it going to be? Rex or Shane?",
        "Gigi: You're loving this, aren't you? We're talking about Shane, mom and dad's grandkid. Their blood runs through his veins.",
        "Stacy: So we're all related. Big whoop.",
        "Gigi: Who are you?",
        "Stacy: I'm the girl Rex should have been in love with.",
        "Gigi: You can't make Rex love you. It doesn't work that way.",
        "Stacy: Why not? You made him love you and you're not half as hot as I am.",
        "Gigi: Hot?",
        "Stacy: I made myself irresistible for Rex. And believe me, he noticed it.",
        "Gigi: Oh, yeah, yeah. He was so into you that you had to drug him to get him into bed with you.",
        "Stacy: You know what, Geeg? You're just wasting time. Your son is upstairs right now looking for a miracle and I'm it. All you have to do is convince Rex that you're not in love with him any more.",
        "Gigi: He'll never believe that.",
        "Stacy: Well, you need to figure out a way to make him believe it. Now, do we have a deal or not?",
        "Gigi: Not.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Jared: You're sure about these results?",
        "Kyle: I told you, okay? We had the whole system upgraded since what happened with David Vickers. I guess he's David Buchanan now. And the results of both of your bone marrow screenings came back, too. Unfortunately, neither of you is a match for Shane Morasco. I'm sorry.",
        "Natalie: Poor Shane.",
        "Natalie: No turning back now, is there?",
        "Jared: We'll handle this. Together.",
        "Natalie: Oh, my God, Jared. We were right. Chloe is Starr's baby.",
        "Jared: And the dead baby in St. James' cemetery is Jessica's.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "[Chloe coos]",
        "Jessica: Hi, hello.",
        "Brody: Thanks for listening.",
        "Jessica: Of course.",
        "Brody: It seems like whenever I've got stuff going on I still want to talk to you.",
        "Jessica: Well, I found a match, and I truly believe that Shane will, too.",
        "Brody: I hope you're right.",
        "Jessica: Do you want to go see him?",
        "Brody: Oh, the kid's probably got a million people around him right now.",
        "Jessica: None of them are you, the bad-ass Navy Seal that he was proud to call his dad. And I know that he's even prouder to call you his friend.",
        "Brody: I want to go.",
        "Jessica: Do you want me to come with you? Moral support?",
        "Brody: You got this little girl to put down for her nap.",
        "Jessica: Are you kidding me? Have you heard her? I think this little diva's vetoed that idea, haven't you? Do you want to go see your cousin Matthew? And pick up big sister Bree on the way home?",
        "Brody: You don't have to do this.",
        "Jessica: Well, if you want to go alone --",
        "Brody: No.",
        "Jessica: Well then, let's go. Yeah. Come on.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Viki: All right, all right. Maybe you are doing this for the children. But, Todd, to initiate this while Blair is incapacitated is not going to win you a lot of sympathy.",
        "Todd: Viki, I'm just trying to take care of my kids while their mother is ill. What's the problem with that?",
        "Viki: You didn't hear a word I said, did you?",
        "Todd: I need your help.",
        "[Viki laughs]",
        "Viki: I needed your help when Jessica had a breakdown and I was half a world away and didn't know about it. And Tess was trying to torture Natalie. I needed your help then. Jessie and Natalie needed your help.",
        "Todd: Okay, okay. I screwed up then. I was out of my mind. I'm not out of my mind now.",
        "Viki: So you say.",
        "Todd: I don't believe this.",
        "Viki: Blair is never going to forgive you if you do this, Todd.",
        "Todd: I tore my ticket with her a long time ago.",
        "Viki: What about your daughter, Starr?",
        "Todd: She needs to know she has a father who's going to be there for her.",
        "Viki: Who will support her mother as much as humanly possible.",
        "Todd: Are you choosing Blair over me?",
        "Viki: I am choosing sanity over chaos. Try it sometime.",
        "Todd: All right, forget it. I don't know why I even asked. Thanks for nothing.",

        "Starr: I know she's getting better and I don't know why I'm crying.",
        "John: You know, it's hard to see her like that.",
        "Starr: Yeah. She asked me what happened to her.",
        "John: What did you say?",
        "Starr: I just told her that she fell down and hit her head. I didn't want to tell her the rest yet.",
        "John: That was good. You did good, Starr.",

        "[Cell phone rings]",

        "John: A couple of days.",
        "Blair: Something bad happened? I asked Mama and Starr, but they wouldn't tell me. But I could see it in their eyes.",
        "John: And what's the last thing you remember?",
        "Blair: You. I was fighting with you, Marty called, and I didn't want you to go. I told you if you left, not to come back.",
        "John: I shouldn't have left.",
        "Blair: So what happened?",
        "John: You don't remember anything else?",
        "Blair: Just -- that I wanted to take a shower to wash you out of my hair.",
        "John: And then?",
        "Blair: I don't know. I -- why don't you just tell me? I mean, otherwise I'm going to ask the first nurse that walks through that door, John.",

        "T\u00e9a: Yeah. I just saw him leaving. I -- I assume he told you that he's going for custody of the kids. Did he ask you to -- to testify for him?",
        "Viki: I think that's what he was going to do.",
        "T\u00e9a: But?",
        "Viki: T\u00e9a, the idea of suing the mother of his children for custody while she lies unconscious in a hospital makes me sick, and that's what I told him.",
        "T\u00e9a: That's probably why you look so upset.",
        "Viki: Yeah, well, huh. He just said, \"You're choosing Blair over me.\"",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh. You're either with him or you're against him.",
        "Viki: And I won't engage with him on those terms.",
        "T\u00e9a: Good for you, Viki. Good for you.",
        "Viki: Why don't -- why don't we go in the library, huh?",
        "T\u00e9a: Okay.",

        "[Antonio exhales]",
        "Antonio: Honey, after what Carlo did to you and what he did to my brother, I -- I knew I was going to have to deal with him.",
        "Talia: You didn't say anything about this to me.",
        "Antonio: Babe, we've been on borrowed time ever since he came back into our lives here. You know that.",
        "Talia: He'll kill you, without a second thought.",
        "Antonio: If I let him get a jump on me. I'll be working with the feds. Nothing's going to happen to me.",
        "Talia: Okay, you can say that to your mom, but this is me you're talking to. I'm not stupid. Things happen, especially when my father's involved. And I cannot believe you set this whole thing up and said nothing to me!",
        "Antonio: Because the whole -- the whole case came up so fast. If we want to have a minute's peace, I have to do this.",
        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "T\u00e9a: I just got a message from Dorian -- uh -- asking me to represent Blair in this custody thing. And I'm thinking of taking her up on it.",
        "Viki: Are you? Todd's not going to like that.",
        "T\u00e9a: I can't keep getting him out of these messes he gets himself into.",
        "Viki: But isn't that what lawyers do?",
        "T\u00e9a: It just -- it takes too much out of me, you know?",
        "Viki: Because he's not just another client, is he?",
        "T\u00e9a: You know, the last time that he walked away from me, I thought \"good riddance.\" The man defines self-centered, arrogant, thoughtless -- screwed-up. I mean, his issues have issues.",
        "Viki: And yet, underneath it all, buried so deep that it rarely surfaces, there is a heart.",
        "T\u00e9a: I know him. I know what he's done. I know what he's capable of, and I should be disgusted by it.",
        "Viki: And you're not?",
        "T\u00e9a: No, I'm not.",

        "Natalie: I'm sorry, Rex.",

        "Stacy: What I deserve! I saw Rex first.",
        "Gigi: Oh, God. Do you have any idea how crazy you sound? A little boy is in there fighting for his life!",
        "Stacy: Well, I'm fighting for mine or at least he would've been if you hadn't ruined it. I love Rex; I'll never love anyone else. This may sound extreme to you --",
        "Gigi: It's not extreme, it's evil! You're evil, Stacy!",
        "Stacy: You're always going to have Shane. You'll meet somebody else; you'll start a new family.",
        "Gigi: God, you're out of your mind, you're psycho. You're psycho, Stacy. [Crying] You're psycho.",

        "Jessica: Yeah. I'll see you later.",
        "Brody: Okay.",
        "Rex: Hey, Brody. You here to get tested?",
        "Brody: Uh, I already did. I'm sorry, man -- I'm not a match. Um -- I wanted to drop by to see Shane if -- if that's okay with you and Gigi.",
        "Rex: Of course it is. Yeah, he was asleep but he's probably awake by now. He'll be psyched to see you. Make sure you ask him to show you the new comic book he's drawing.",
        "Brody: I will. Oh, wait -- Rex? They have any leads on a match yet or --",
        "Rex: No, not yet. But we will -- I'm sure of it.",
        "Brody: Okay.",

        "Viki: Well, Blair's the mother of his children.",
        "T\u00e9a: Oh, it's more than that. I've seen the two of them together. When they fight, it's like foreplay. Todd will do anything to stay engaged.",
        "Viki: Including suing for custody?",
        "T\u00e9a: Well, there's no question he cares about his kids.",

        "T\u00e9a: Well, that's not why I would be doing it. Look, the reason I would represent Blair is in an effort to break the cycle.",
        "Viki: Alienate Todd and prove to yourself that you've moved on?",
        "T\u00e9a: Maybe.",

        "Jessica: That's great.",
        "Starr: Yeah, it is. I got to talk to her, which made me feel a lot better, but she's still weak. John's in there with her right now.",
        "Jessica: You must be so relieved.",
        "Starr: I was just glad to hear her voice again. Michael says that, uh, she should be okay.",

        "[SCENE_BREAK]",
        "Blair: I was stabbed?",

        "Talia: Who won't allow it -- Bo?",
        "Antonio: The feds. They think your father will get to you. Besides --",
        "Talia: That is such crap!",
        "Antonio: Honey, my daughter needs you. Okay? Now, that's me talking.",
        "Talia: Yeah, but she needs you more.",
        "Antonio: You think I want to leave my daughter? I want to protect her. So I need you to stay here, look after her. I'll be back as soon as I can. Hey -- I love you.",

        "Viki: Maybe not.",
        "T\u00e9a: You're the only one I can talk to who understands Todd -- huh -- who knows how hard it is to love him.",
        "Viki: It's even harder to stop. Oh, I've written my brother off more times than I count, and then all of a sudden, he will do something incredibly, surprisingly human.",
        "T\u00e9a: Yeah, and then you give him another chance.",
        "Viki: See, now I can't figure out whether you came here to get me to talk you into representing Blair or to talk you out of it.",
        "T\u00e9a: Or maybe just to babble.",
        "Viki: Now, I don't think you've babbled once in your life.",

        "Stacy: You're making a big mistake -- you're going to regret it. You asked God for a miracle and he gave it to you. Now you're just spitting in his face. You're going to regret it -- do you hear me? You're going to be sorry, Gigi!",
        "[Stacy sighs]",
        "Stacy: I know what love is, okay? I -- I love Rex. That's why I'm doing this. I got to make it right, the way it's supposed to be. Gigi's going to see that -- she's going to see that it's the right thing. She's going to give Rex to me. [Stacy sighs] she has to.",
        "Rex: Hey, I just ran into Brody. He got tested but he isn't a match -- hey, hey, hey. What's wrong?",

        "Natalie: A part of me just wishes that I had listened to you and that I'd never gone down this road, but now that we have --",
        "Jared: Sweetheart, look, we have to see this through, okay? We got to tell Jessica, Starr, Michael, Marcie -- everyone. We have to tell them the truth.",
