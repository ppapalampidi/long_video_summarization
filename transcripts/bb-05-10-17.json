        "Bill tells CJ and Wyatt that Sally has to come up with the $100 Grand today or the building is his. He tells them Emmy is the only one around who will tell him the truth. He hands CJ a check and tells him to count the zeroes. Today the building will be his. He and CJ leave with only Wyatt in the office when Liam comes in. Liam tells him he knows the secret now of what his dad did. He meets Emmy and takes a selfie of her and the skyscraper mockup. Wyatt tells Liam for the record all the damage had been done before he found out about Sally. Sally takes one last look around with all the memories. She tells them she will go back and re-open the bakery. Saul is not sure her bakery can use a sugar made tailor. Thomas shows Steffy the design Sally made. Steffy agrees that she has something. Steffy keeps hearing Liam's words in her ears of why Sally failed ..it was his dad's doings. So it was not Jarrett's review after all. She confides in him what Bill made Jarrett do, writing his review for him. Coco got caught up in it accidentally and now so are they.",
        "Wyatt tells Liam that everybody is not him. Hell he probably would have done the same thing Bill did. Wyatt says he is practical not cynical and he does not have to discuss this with him anymore. The building will be Bills by the end of the day. Bill and CJ go to Spectra and he shows Sally the check and says unless she can match that and not $5 at a time then he takes over at the end of the business day. Sally says he knows she can't so he can hand it to CJ now. Thomas walks in and advises CJ not to sign that just yet. Sally is going nowhere. Steffy tells Liam that she doesn't particularly like Sally but it is not fair what Bill did. Liam says Bill is over there now taking over. Bill tells Thomas that this is not a damsel in distress. This is grown up time with a knock off artist. He must be a slow learner like his father. Thomas tells Sally the truth. Jarrett works for Spencer Publications and he wrote what Bill told him. Bill says he is not going to sit here and listen to a chip off the old blockhead. Thomas tells Sally to listen to him. Do not go; she can count on him."

        "Bill: So I'm thinking of moving the entrance to the parking garage back here.",
        "Emmy: How will people find it?",
        "Bill: These are Los Angeles drivers. They'll -- they'll find it. And all you'll see from the street is this beautiful tower of smoked glass.",
        "Emmy: You sure like smoked glass. What's so great about smoked glass?",
        "Bill: It's the perfect building material. You can see through it, and yet you can't.",
        "Emmy: Like the right underwear.",
        "Bill: Like the right under-- look what happens when you walk away from your desk.",
        "Emmy: Do you have an appointment?",
        "Wyatt: Since birth.",
        "C.J.: Uh, I do, actually.",
        "Bill: They're okay.",
        "Emmy: I'd better go see what other kind of trouble we've got hanging around out there.",
        "Bill: Please.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Wyatt: So, asking Emmy for architectural advice now, are we?",
        "Bill: The only one around here who tells me the truth.",
        "Wyatt: She'll learn.",
        "Bill: So, today's the big day. Sally has to come up with that 100 large to save Spectra fashions.",
        "C.J.: Clearly that's not happening.",
        "Bill: Well, wouldn't you know, as it happens, I have a very handsome, very official Spencer Publications check that covers that 100 grand and the purchase of that property... if you're ready to do business.",
        "Shirley: I can't believe that this is happening.",
        "Darlita: Should we bury it, maybe?",
        "Saul: You'll have to pry it out of my cold, dead hands.",
        "Coco: Hey. Today's the day?",
        "Sally: On the bright side, at least no one's measuring me for an orange jumpsuit.",
        "Liam: Sally stole Forrester designs. Why? Because she believed her designs weren't good enough.",
        "Steffy: Because of Jarrett's review.",
        "Liam: Jarrett didn't write it. My dad did.",
        "Steffy: Oh, my...",
        "Liam: Can you keep this from Thomas forever and live with yourself?",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Steffy: How'd it go?",
        "Thomas: It went.",
        "Steffy: Sally sticking around?",
        "Thomas: I won't be seeing her again. None of us will. That's all I know.",
        "C.J.: It's slightly more complicated than you just handing me a check.",
        "Bill: The hell it is! Count the zeroes, son!",
        "Wyatt: Huh? You talking to me?",
        "Bill: I'm not talking to you. I don't mean biological son. I'm talking about \"son\" --",
        "C.J.: They have a valid lease. That's the thing.",
        "Bill: Which she defaulted on.",
        "C.J.: Exactly, because she paid off her loan to shifty, or shifter, I mean, when the orders first started pouring in. Look, maybe he'll make her another loan. I don't know.",
        "Bill: On a business that's dead? I don't think so.",
        "C.J.: [Sighs]",
        "Bill: All right, listen. I get it. I understand. It's family, so it's delicate.",
        "C.J.: Exactly.",
        "Bill: Come with me, and I'm gonna show you how it's done.",
        "C.J.: How what's done?",
        "Bill: Eviction. And, you!",
        "Wyatt: Huh?",
        "Bill: Don't use my phone pretending to be me! Don't do that again!",
        "Wyatt: I would never... lunch gets here so much faster. [Clears throat] [Deep voice] Yeah, this is Mr. Spencer. I'd like a tuna on ry-- [Normal voice] Yeah, it's Wyatt. Alison, I just -- [Stammering]",
        "Liam: Order me something.",
        "Wyatt: Can you get him a veggie burger, too? Yeah, and, for the record, it's my last name, too, thank you. He reprogrammed the phone again.",
        "Liam: Hey, where were, uh, dad and C.J. going? I just missed them at the elevator.",
        "Wyatt: To pronounce Spectra dead, I believe.",
        "Liam: Oh. Well, speaking of which, I know what dad did to sink them now.",
        "Shirley: [Sighs]",
        "Coco: I'm sorry.",
        "Sally: Thanks.",
        "Coco: I'm not sorry you showed everyone why I always looked up to you. But I'm -- I'm sorry you have to put your dreams on the back burner.",
        "Sally: I don't think there's any burners left. It was fun while it lasted.",
        "[Applause]",
        "Sally: Say it's better to have loved and lost.",
        "Coco: I know you loved this place.",
        "Sally: That, too.",
        "Steffy: Can I see?",
        "Thomas: Yeah. It's from Sally. It's her goodbye gift.",
        "Steffy: Well, you're right. She is something.",
        "Thomas: She's got vision. I mean, she -- she's clearly got talent.",
        "Steffy: Why wouldn't she rely on that instead of stealing from us?",
        "Thomas: Because Jarrett's review sunk them. I mean, how is a first-time designer supposed to come back from something like this? Excuse me.",
        "Emmy: Is this all the wedding pictures you have?",
        "Liam: I was busy.",
        "Emmy: Doing what?",
        "Liam: Getting married.",
        "Emmy: You know, sometimes I catch your father in here looking at this, cradling his --",
        "Liam: Whoa! Whoa!",
        "Wyatt: We don't want to hear about that!",
        "Liam: Yeah!",
        "Emmy: Scotch! Cradling his scotch! Just staring at the thing. So take my picture.",
        "Liam: Um... oh, okay. Yeah.",
        "[Camera shutter clicking]",
        "Liam: One more.",
        "[Camera shutter clicks]",
        "Emmy: Okay. Now, good. Now send it to your father.",
        "Liam: Why?",
        "Emmy: And you want to caption it. \"Hey, pop. Two of your favorite things. Smoked glass and smoking Emmy.\" [Laughs]",
        "Liam: [Laughs]",
        "Wyatt: We got to start calling him \"pop.\"",
        "Liam: Oh, he'd hate it so much. [Sighs] You know, there are other sites he could have built this soulless monstrosity.",
        "Wyatt: He wants what he wants. As do we all. And for the record, the damage was already done before I found out.",
        "Liam: Did you object? Did you say anything at all?",
        "Wyatt: It's not my job to improve anybody. Did I think it was petty, not very sporting of him? Yeah. But look how it turned out. Spectra was gonna do under without dad's help.",
        "Liam: Do you know that? 'Cause I don't. Maybe Sally wouldn't have gone down that path if dad hadn't have sabotaged her. And by the way, I told Steffy.",
        "Wyatt: I'm sorry. What?",
        "Sally: The landlord's name is Ari. I told him you were gonna be taking over my place. This month's rent is paid, but, you know, when your internship starts back up...",
        "Coco: But where will you be?",
        "Sally: Grams and I are going to reopen the bakery.",
        "Shirley: Yeah, Sally has an idea for making multigrain dresses.",
        "Darlita: I've never met an intellectual person as nice as you. A gift.",
        "Sally: Darlita, I can't accept this.",
        "Darlita: It's just a gift card.",
        "Sally: Okay, but I haven't even been able to pay you for the last two weeks.",
        "Saul: Four.",
        "Darlita: It -- it's okay. Some of those clothes that I packed up went straight into my car.",
        "Shirley: [Laughs] Well, that's the spirit.",
        "Sally: 20% off at bed-n-bath depot?",
        "Darlita: I know.",
        "Sally: That's so sweet.",
        "Saul: Um... I don't think you should go.",
        "Sally: Yeah, well, no one else thinks I should stay.",
        "Saul: Well, then, uh, I don't suppose your bakery could use a journeyman tailor?",
        "Sally: You're gonna do really great things right here in L.A., Saul.",
        "[Door opens]",
        "Saul: Why do I feel like all my great things are behind me?",
        "C.J.: [Clears throat] Oh, you guys are still here.",
        "Shirley: We are moving as fast as we can, C.J.!",
        "C.J.: Hey, easy, aunt Shirley, okay? You know I didn't want it to go down like this.",
        "Sally: Was I supposed to give you a written notice of something?",
        "C.J.: Uh, well, either that or the $100,000 you owe.",
        "Bill: Which is a debt I'm assuming, along with your lease and the building.",
        "Thomas: She was different.",
        "Steffy: Sally's different, all right.",
        "Thomas: The women that I've known, the women that I've been with, I mean, she stood out like crazy. And it wasn't love at first sight, but like the fifth, sixth time, yeah.",
        "Steffy: Thomas, this is not like you.",
        "Thomas: It wasn't me. I was the man that I wanted to be when I was with her. God, maybe I should just go with her.",
        "Steffy: Thomas, what? No.",
        "Thomas: How am I supposed to find that again? Where am I even supposed to start looking?",
        "Steffy: [Sighs] You know, Jarrett agreed that Sally had promise as a designer.",
        "Thomas: Why didn't he say that? Every sentence was like a poison arrow.",
        "Steffy: The Spectra review that ran under his name? He didn't write it. Bill Spencer did.",
        "Steffy: Liam found out.",
        "Thomas: What do you mean, Liam found out?",
        "Steffy: Jarrett thought Sally's work was raw and original but very exciting.",
        "Thomas: So what does that have to do with Bill?",
        "Steffy: Spencer publications wanted that building. But Bill knew he wasn't gonna get it if Spectra was doing well. So he told Jarrett to write a terrible review. And then when Jarrett came back, he had a mostly positive review. So Bill scrapped it and wrote one himself and published it under Jarrett's name.",
        "Thomas: So all of this is about a real estate deal?",
        "Steffy: It doesn't excuse thievery. But it does make sense why Sally gave up on her work. She was desperate to keep the lights on and make payroll.",
        "Thomas: So Sally knew that there was an offer on the building, and how did nobody put it together that it was Bill?",
        "Steffy: I didn't -- I didn't know. I just found out today. Liam found out from Jarrett. Look, we can't erase the damage. But if there was a shady plan, it was Bill's, not Sally's. She got caught up in it, and so did we. Thomas, wait. What -- Thomas!",
        "[Door closes]",
        "Wyatt: You told Steffy? [Laughs] Dad is not gonna be happy with you.",
        "Liam: Yeah, well, it's only fair, considering all the misery he's already caused.",
        "Wyatt: You know, if he fires you, I'm not gonna defend you.",
        "Liam: He's not gonna fire me. You know why? Because dad secretly likes it when we hold him to a higher standard.",
        "Wyatt: I am shaking my head at you. You know why? 'Cause you think everyone is you. Guess what? We're not. I would have done the same thing dad did. Hell, I would have even done what Sally Spectra did, too.",
        "Liam: [Laughs] Oh, really?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Liam: Really?",
        "Wyatt: Yeah.",
        "Liam: You would steal designs.",
        "Wyatt: Yeah. 'Cause a dress is a dress. You pull it over your head, there's two holes for the arms, a zipper up the back, and they're all pretty much made for the same thing -- to be taken off.",
        "Liam: Oh, that's interesting. So how come some are thousands of dollars and others are $19.99?",
        "Wyatt: Gullibility.",
        "Liam: Okay, all right, you know what? You and dad like to pretend that you're so damn cynical, but I know better.",
        "Wyatt: I'm practical, Liam. There's a difference. Cynical people always say, \"the end justifies the means.\" A practical person says, \"the end is the end, so suck it up and get over it.\" And since Spectra is gonna be a pile of rubble by the end of the week, I find I just don't have to discuss this with you anymore.",
        "Sally: Cut it out, grams!",
        "Saul: I ought to march right in there and...",
        "Darlita: What is Spencer Publications?",
        "Saul: Everything you read.",
        "Coco: Run by one of the wealthiest men in the country, maybe even the world. Wow, I-I really can't believe this is the end of the line for Spectra.",
        "Sally: What do I write?",
        "C.J.: Uh, how about \"I hereby declare\" --",
        "Bill: You two don't have enough business acumen between the two of you to run a lemonade stand.",
        "C.J.: Hey, my businesses are doing just fine.",
        "Bill: So I see. You promised to make your past-due payment of $100,000 today. And no, you can't pay it off at $5 a month.",
        "Sally: I can't pay it at all.",
        "Bill: Right. So nothing more in writing is required. You're in breach of your contract with, uh, C.J. over here, which means that you and your employees have to be out by close of business today.",
        "C.J.: I am really sorry about this, Sally.",
        "Sally: Don't. I'm the one that let everybody down. I thought I had talent, but I don't.",
        "Bill: Oh, come on now. You know what they say. Uh, stiff upper lip, keep your chin up, and all that stuff. You're not the first person to make that mistake. So, C.J., you do have some signing to do. This first page acknowledges receipt of my earnest money. Here is your letter of intent to hand over this, uh, derelict building to me, and, uh, a date with the wrecking ball.",
        "Thomas: Whatever that is, don't sign it. Sally, you're not going anywhere.",
        "Shirley: I know he kept Sally out of prison, but I don't think I like that boy.",
        "Darlita: He touched me.",
        "Saul: He pushed you out of the way.",
        "Darlita: He's so manly! [Chuckles]",
        "Shirley: What is he doing back here for, anyway?",
        "Saul: Well, he and the billionaire are probably in there carving up the spoils.",
        "Coco: No, no, no. Thomas is here for Sally.",
        "Saul: Here for her for what?",
        "Coco: That look in his eye? Love her, I think.",
        "Liam: So, you told Thomas.",
        "Steffy: I had to.",
        "Liam: [Chuckling] I mean, you were really adamant about him not knowing.",
        "Steffy: I know what I said. I wanted this crazy woman out of his life. But she got a raw deal, and I have to remember what Bill did to my family and the company. He doesn't play fair, and you know that.",
        "Liam: Wow. Is this... is this Sally's?",
        "Steffy: Sally's. Yep. Apparently she knows what she's doing.",
        "Liam: Yeah. It's kind of sad she won't be doing it much longer.",
        "Steffy: I wonder if they would have been okay, what would have happened if Jarrett's actual review had seen the light of day.",
        "Liam: What did, um, what did Thomas say?",
        "Steffy: Thomas took off. He went to Spectras. Or, if not, he's over at Bill's.",
        "Liam: Well, my dad is at Spectras right now. He's \"putting the final nail in the coffin,\" so...",
        "Steffy: Then Thomas is over at Spectras. You know what it's like when your heart is on the line.",
        "Liam: Yeah, I do.",
        "Bill: Wow. I mean, that was, uh, that was something. Quite an entrance. A real hero moment for you. Only problem is this is not a damsel in distress. Sally's a ripoff artist, and you were her mark!",
        "Thomas: Is that really how it is, Bill?",
        "Bill: You know what? I'm all for young love and videos of dogs and cats getting along. I think it's beautiful. But you're gonna have to take her out for ice cream and consolation later. This is grown-up time! Look for the little yellow tabs that say \"sign here.\"",
        "Thomas: C.J., I've known you for a long time now. I'm gonna tell you respectfully you're being hustled.",
        "C.J.: What is going on here?",
        "Bill: This is ridiculous.",
        "Sally: Thomas, it means a lot to me that you're here, okay? But there's nothing here to save. Everything we had you and your family already own, so at least let C.J. walk away with something. His only crime was believing in me.",
        "Thomas: I believed in you. I still do.",
        "Bill: Yeah, and look where that got you. Obviously a slow learner like your father.",
        "Thomas: [Chuckles]",
        "Sally: Trust me. If I can blame anybody else for going belly up, I would.",
        "Thomas: Jarrett believed in you, too. Didn't he, Bill? He saw the same potential in you that I do.",
        "Sally: [Scoffs] Let's not rewrite history. We all know that's not what his review said.",
        "Thomas: That's because he wasn't allowed to say that. You see, Jarrett is the chief critic for eye on fashion. Eye on fashion is owned by Spencer publications. And Bill here wanted this building for a pet project of his, and so you had to fail. So the decent review that Jarrett turned in was sent to the shredder. And, Bill, you wrote your own glowing review of this, didn't you, for the purpose of having you vacate this building ASAP.",
        "C.J.: Seriously? Is that true?",
        "Bill: You want to know what's true? Dollars and cents. That's what's true. I'm not gonna sit here and debate with some chip off the old halfwit. I mean, a week ago, he wanted your head on a silver platter! Now he wants to be your knight in shining pencil pants! That's what these people do! You want to believe in something, C.J.? Believe in money!",
        "Thomas: C.J., Believe in blood. It's thicker than water, and it's thicker than this man's wallet. Sally. You have so much potential, and you have the opportunity to be so successful. You used to know that. Stay here, and I will never let you forget that again."
